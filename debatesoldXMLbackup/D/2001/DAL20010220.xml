      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Downing Street on Wednesday, 31 January, and the SDLP on 13 February to review all aspects of the current discussions and decide how best to take them forward. My officials and I are in regular contact with the UUP and Sinn Féin. We are focused on overcoming the remaining difficulties in the full implementation of the Agreement and will be continuing our intensive efforts in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been due to attend on Sunday, 11 February, the unveiling of the Famine memorial at Carfin, Lanarkshire, which had been erected by the Famine memorial committee with assistance from my Department's commemoration initiatives sub<Col N="1159" /> head. I had also been invited by the board of Celtic Football Club to attend a Scottish League match between Celtic and Rangers on the same day. Some days before the ceremony I was advised by our ambassador in London that concerns had been expressed in relation to the holding of the event on the same day as the Celtic-Rangers match. In view of these concerns I took the decision not to travel to Scotland. I look forward to accepting the invitation to pay an official visit to Scotland and unveiling the Famine memorial at Carfin later in the year.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the spate of sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland, including Larne. As I said in my reply to the House on 31 January, we have made the strongest representations on this matter through the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and called for immediate and effective action by the security forces. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also raised the issue directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I utterly condemn these horrific attacks which are an affront to the vast majority in Northern Ireland who want peace. I welcome the fact, however, that people from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland have condemned the attacks and I am pleased that the security for-ces seem to be making significant progress in dealing with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the difficulties that have unfolded in recent days and weeks does the Taoiseach believe that Sinn Féin genuinely wants to find a solution that will lead towards the establishment of an acceptable police force in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This round of discussions has lasted five weeks. We have discussed policing, about which Deputy Quinn asked, as well as the aspects of the original Police (Northern Ireland) Bill and the second implementation plan which differ from the Patten report to ascertain where difficult issues arise. Although certain aspects remain to be finalised, the discussions have addressed matters of concern to the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Catholic Church, parties in this House and others. A judgment will soon have to be made by the parties in the North when Deputy Quinn's question will be answered. The Secretary of State, Mr. John Reid, who is in the North for a few days, held discussions with Sinn Féin and the SDLP last night. This afternoon I spoke to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, who will meet some of the parties involved before travelling to the United States tomorrow. Everyone will have to make a judgment in the next week.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Did the Taoiseach cancel his visit to Carfin, Lanarkshire, on the <Col N="1160" /> advice of Mr. Frank Roy, a Labour MP who, according to his colleagues, is not the swiftest brain in Westminster? Does the Taoiseach believe that the threat of a sectarian incident if he attended the function was a gross exaggeration? Unlike the Taoiseach, I was in Glasgow that weekend for a Scottish Socialist Party conference, not the old firm show. There was immense publicity in the Scottish press. Does the Taoiseach realise that ordinary working class people in Lanarkshire and beyond were deeply offended by the suggestion that, as one Member of the Scottish Parliament put it, they were being portrayed, not necessarily by the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not give quotations at Question Time. He should ask a brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>A Member of the Scottish Parliament said that it was like comparing Lanarkshire to segregationist Mississippi. Does the Taoiseach believe that Mr. Roy was advised by the First Minister, Mr. Henry McLeish, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. John Reid, or the Scottish Secretary, Mrs. Helen Liddell, to whom Mr. Roy was Parliamentary Secretary before being forced to resign? Is that the reason the Taoiseach took the threat so seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not commented on the matter in recent weeks and have no wish to do so now, other than to say that my decision was based on the advice of our ambassador, Mr. Barrington. I am aware of the speculation and have read the comments made in Scotland, but they have not influenced me. Mr. Barrington and our consul general in Glasgow, Mr. Mulhall, discussed the matter and outlined their views. My judgment was based on their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the situation in the run-up to the British general election presents a terrifying impasse which needs to be addressed? Is he satisfied the parties in the North have set out adequately their detailed positions on policing? If so, are the differences as insurmountable as some prophets of doom say? Does he believe he has a role in bringing together, in a final effort before the British general elections, those with influence on the policing impasse, particularly the church leaders? They have been waiting rather than influencing their followers to reach a compromise. If he does not have this role, who does?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies Quinn and Sargent said, we have a last opportunity before the British general elections to reach a conclusion of this stage &ndash; there will be other stages as the agenda unfolds over three, six or even nine years. There were issues not finalised in the Good Friday Agreement but which were not ignored. Policing was to be dealt with by the Patten Com<Col N="1161" /> mission, decommissioning by General John de Chastelain and the Independent Commission on Decommissioning and demilitarisation by the British government when circumstances permitted. Other issues were the OTRs and the stability of the institutions, the latter being the responsibility of the First and Deputy First Ministers.</P>
      <P>We have been trying to get an agreement on these issues within the five weeks. These are not all the outstanding issues but they are important. It is our aim to reach an agreed conclusion on these matters. We have not crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dotted every &ldquo;i&rdquo;, but there has been more than 90% progress. There are always differences of emphasis and opinion on what can be achieved. In the end the parties, collectively, but especially individually, have to decide what is satisfactory. The Governments are working together and bilaterally with them to get everyone across the line in this phase. This has to be done in the next week or so.</P>
      <P>Referring to Deputy Quinn's question, I am concerned because no progress will create difficulties. There can be no such thing as the <i>status quo </i>in the peace process, as with a peace process anywhere. It cannot remain static. I accept that I have a role, as do the churches and others, in trying to persuade the parties if there is a deal which, although not perfect, can enable progress. We ourselves have not come to a conclusion yet but will decide soon. Everyone in the House realises the importance of progress. It is a difficult but important time. I hope the parties in the North reflect on what has been achieved and on what has yet to be achieved. If some major parts are not yet achieved, I, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the officials, who have been involved in this matter for many years, will continue to do our best to bring it to a conclusion. However, for the information of the House and, more importantly, people outside it, the matter cannot drift on endlessly. People somewhere will have to make a call soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Taoiseach about the urgency of reaching a decision on this crucial matter of policing. Does the Taoiseach agree that the differences now appear to be limited to the four main headings of accountability, operational matters, inquiries and symbols? Given his knowledge of how legislation is processed by Legislatures, is it the Taoiseach's view that these differences could be resolved without recourse to more legislation in the British Parliament? It appears implicit in his comments about this matter that he believes these differences can be resolved without recourse again to the British Parliament. Is that his view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that an understanding can be reached on these issues. Ultimately, <Col N="1162" /> they will require legislation, but they do not need legislation now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the answer to Sinn Féin? Could the Taoiseach say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; rather than nod?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that, during the past six weeks, there have been approximately 50 pipe bomb attacks of a sectarian nature on Roman Catholic families in the North of Ireland? Will he give more detail about the discussions he has had in which his concerns about these attacks have been expressed? Is he in a position to outline to the House what action is being taken to bring these sectarian attacks to an end? Will he acknowledge that their continuance adds to the risks, dangers and uncertainty of the current situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were approximately 70 to 80 pipe bomb attacks throughout last year. Up to 14 February 2001, there were 62 such attacks.</P>
      <P>The extent of pipe bomb attacks exclusively on Nationalist households is terrible. On at least four occasions, it was a miracle that there were no fatalities. In some cases, if anybody had been present at the time, there would have been fatalities.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion that I answered questions on this matter, the former Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, undertook to meet the relatives and local police officers. Such a meeting has taken place; the former Secretary of State's replacement has continued his work in this regard. The RUC has put in extra resources and it found at least one of the factories and some other isolated matters. However, there is still enormous fear in many areas.</P>
      <P>It is clear that these were not isolated attacks and Deputies will recall that last year I repeatedly raised this matter in relation to Portadown. There have not been any attacks in Portadown recently; all the attacks have taken place in up to 15 towns across the North. It has been a systematic campaign even if, in the view of the political system in the North, they were not sanctioned by the leadership of any group. However, from the perspective of whoever is behind it, it has been an effective operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, met SDLP representatives. He also met a number of the families who have been attacked. He has addressed this with the Secretary of State. I have impressed the issues and the details on the <Col N="1163" /> Northern Ireland secretariat every week. I also discussed it with the British Prime Minister at the end of January, when he was with the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, and on numerous occasions since by telephone.</P>
    <P>In fairness the RUC is putting extra resources into dealing with the problem but it has not eased and there has been a number of serious issues in the past week or so. We must continue to address this. Most of these pipe bombs are of similar construction. Most have been made with technology which may not be of great quality but that does not make them any less lethal. They have exploded and their potential is quite clear to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the delicacy of the present negotiating position. I would like the Taoiseach to agree to allow me, together with my spokesman on foreign affairs, a confidential briefing by his officials and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs on the present state of the negotiations. Second, I would like a briefing for myself and my justice and security spokesperson on the threat now presented by the paramilitary die-hards on both sides to the security of persons, both north and south of the Border.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but obviously in a separate context. Why have the British-Irish Council meetings been postponed? I understand it was due to meet on a couple of occasions and the meetings were postponed. There are other East/West items on the agenda of that council which are pertinent and real. When is it intended to have the next British-Irish Council meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government is ready to meet at any time. There have been a number of dates arranged, as Deputy Quinn stated, but the postponements were not at our behest. None of the issues would have affected matters &ndash; they were other issues &ndash; but we gave way to the sensitivities of particularly one party on these issues.</P>
      <P>As of now, the date of the meeting is predicated on the progress we will make over the next week or ten days. I do not see there being a meeting of any of the bodies until we make some progress on this round. We are ready to do that at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the timetable for such meetings should not be open to interpretation and that arbitrary postponement can be taken to mean that there are more prob<Col N="1164" /> lems than perhaps exist? Would he agree that it is preferable that these meetings are set on a regular basis and proceed irrespective of what other difficulties exist, in order to maintain a normal and balanced relationship and to make progress on all three strands of the Good Friday Agreement?</P>

      <P>I believe that. I could have created difficulties about some of these cancellations. I did not, for the obvious reason, but it cannot continue on that basis. The institutions are, by and large, working well and I am quite happy to have the East/West and North/South meetings on the same day, if it saves everybody time. I think it would save everybody time. I have no hangups about any of these items.</P>
      <P>By and large the agenda we have worked out covers issues such as the drugs issue, which was to be discussed at the last meeting. We had presentation papers and a great deal of data on the drugs issue which we have assembled here from our experiences, good and bad, in the past decade which would have been helpful to everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>The meetings were cancelled at short notice, as Deputy Quinn is aware, probably to give some assistance. I would far prefer that all of the meetings, whether they are meetings of the North/ South Council, the overall structural body, the East/West bodies or the interparliamentary body were held on a regular basis, regardless of what is happening. Thankfully, meetings of the interparliamentary body have not really been affected other than that one group has not turned up.</P>

      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach's initial reply that, while the major outstanding matters of decommissioning, demilitarisation and policing still remain, in terms of a negotiating position, he sees progress being made on the policing issue in the coming week to ten days while acknowledging at the same time that the other issues are equally important? In terms of advancing the outstanding issues, I take it the policing issue is on the front line now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it has been such for at least three of the five weeks of negotiations. However, it should not be read that some of the other issues cannot create difficulties. Certainly all the detailed discussions of recent weeks centred on the Northern Ireland police service Bill as against the Patten report. We would like to take all the issues together. It would be much better for the negotiation process if we could deal with all three items together as one package. They are related in their own ways and I do not see the parties, especially the main parties, moving unless there is an understanding on all three. If we resolved the policing issue and did not make progress with the other two issues, we would still probably not crack existing difficulties.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell me in terms of his negotiating position if each of the three issues &ndash; decommissioning, demilitarisation and policing &ndash; is being treated as a unit in itself for negotiating purposes or is there an attempt to arrange compromises which cross from one unit to another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, each is an item in its own right. As always, and not so much from the Government's perspective as from the parties' perspectives, what is achieved on each one and what is achieved collectively is a major influence. The argument on decommissioning is fairly evident, namely, re-engagement with the de Chastelain commission. The issue of demilitarisation is a question of how the military infrastructure in Northern Ireland can be reduced to a peacetime level. The debate on policing is the issue of how to return to the Patten proposals. In many ways, we have had to expend an enormous amount of energy in getting back to where we should have been in September 1999. However, it has been necessary to do that because, as we often said in the House, the Northern Ireland police service Bill has moved so far from the proposals. Discussions are taking place to try to return to the proposals. On Deputy Currie's question whether that can be done without legislative measures, I believe it can be done now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach afford me a similar briefing to that which he has offered to the other Opposition parties to ensure the Green Party is as helpful as possible in the course of the process and fully equipped with the information to put its proposals in context? On his previous reply, does the Taoiseach agree that the home-made nature of the pipe bombs and the atrocities they cause and are capable of causing emphasise that, whatever decommissioning agreement is reached, it will by its nature be inconclusive? That said, does it not highlight even more the central and vital importance of resolving the policing impasse? As it is assumed that two weeks remain before those involved go into election mode, is it envisaged that a deadline will be set, as was the case with other deadlines which led to us watching late night reports from outside Stormont? Does the Taoiseach agree that the policing impasse will require a deadline or will it be left to drift with all the risks that entails?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Setting a deadline in terms of a time or day is a bad idea, but that will become self-evident. Those involved are working towards <Col N="1166" /> local elections in late May as well as a general election, though I know no more than anyone else when a general election will be called. People are talking about being two months into their campaign, from which one can work out the date.</P>
      <P>People will want to know what the position is, but it is unlikely that progress will be made during that period. It is unhelpful from a negotiating position that that is how matters stand. It would be far more helpful if there were no elections in Northern Ireland this year, but that is the situation and it creates a deadline for this phase of negotiations.</P>
      <P>To be fair to all parties, there were five week-ends of negotiations in a six week period, an enormous burden for our officials and the party representatives. That cannot be kept up indefinitely, but that is what happened in each round of the discussions. There are intensive discussions for a period, then a deadline is called and that phase works or not. We have been in both positions in the last seven to eight years and it is the same now. It would be unfortunate if all the work since November was to go to waste, as it has been centred on these issues. The agenda was the same before Christmas. One way or the other, these issues will have to be taken up at a later date as they will not go away. I do not have to spell out their ability to cause problems.</P>

Does he agree that it would be preferable if the people concerned were charged with the murders they perpetrated? If that possibility appears remote, does he agree that every effort should be made to make sure they do not escape scot free?

        <b>: </b>When the Irish ambassador to Great Britain and the Irish consul general to Scotland, Mr. Mulhall, advised the Taoiseach that he should not travel to Carfin, Lanarkshire, did he inquire if an assessment had been made by the two advisers as to whether a threat was posed or whether Mr. Roy was playing a sectarian card, in some perverse way, for his own ends or those of others? Did the advice offered by the ambassador and consul general indicate that Mr. Roy had acted alone? Is the Taoiseach aware of the deep offence that has been caused to ordinary people in Scotland because of the implications of his visit being cancelled?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in Northern Ireland matters have moved from the horror of people's homes being pipe-bombed to their being threatened in their places of work? Is he also aware that the staff of the Mater Hospital in Belfast have received serious threats of a sectarian nature, presumably from loyalist splinter groups? Is he further aware that 200 members of the trade union, Unison, Protestant and Catholic, who work at the hospital staged an affirmative protest against those threats and demanded that they be withdrawn? Does the Taoiseach agree that while the majority of ordinary decent people in the Protestant community deplore sectarian threats and pipe bomb attacks, they feel isolated? Does he also agree that the trade union movement in the North should be urged to take affirmative action in breaking that isolation by encouraging its members to mobilise and take action against such sectarian threats as happened after the Canary Wharf bombing when the tens of thousands of workers who took to the streets played a key role in defusing sectarian tensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the hurt and concern caused by the cancellation of my trip to Scotland and, for that reason, I will make an official visit to that country, meet the various people to whom the Deputy referred and unveil the plaque at Carfin. The security forces in Scotland did not believe that my visit posed a threat, but there was no point in my becoming involved in a situation which might affect extremely friendly relationships. As I did not want that to happen, I took the advice I was given. We will do our utmost to ensure the engagement is fulfilled at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions has, for the past 30 years, been to the forefront in ensuring sectarianism is exposed. It did so in some of the darkest periods in the history of the North, <Col N="1168" /> including Bloody Sunday, Bloody Friday, Black Friday and other events. During the years the trade union movement, North and South, was involved in peace initiatives such as the STOP campaign and others. Long before I became Taoiseach I supported its efforts in trying to expose sectarianism, break down barriers and promote equality. The movement is in a position, through the various vehicles now available in Northern Ireland, including the Human Rights Commission, to break down past and present forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>I am heartened that all the political parties and churches have come out strongly against pipe bombs and other sectarian attacks. It is a fact of life, not always much publicised, that breaches of security and violent activities in the North have not stopped. There is still an amount of activity by paramilitary groups or breakaway paramilitary groups which continues to be of concern. I have no doubt the majority of Catholics, Protestants, loyalists, republicans, and people who would not classify themselves as being in any of those categories, are against these actions, find them barbaric and want only a peaceful existence with the people who live in their communities. That is the view of practically everybody I meet either in the North or from the North.</P>

      <P>The issue of prompt service delivery in the Civil Service is addressed through the strategic management initiative &ndash; SMI &ndash; under its quality customer service &ndash; QCS &ndash; initiative. Under this initiative, a set of QCS principles was adopted in 1997, and revised last year, requiring Departments and offices to respond to queries in a timely way and with minimum delay.</P>
      <P>There is also a requirement to set out standards for meeting this requirement in departmental customer action plans, which are currently being revised.</P>
      <P>The QCS initiative also urges Departments and offices to make the best use of available and emerging new technologies to improve access and choice for customers through the development of more online services. Departments are required to address service delivery issues in their statements of strategy and to make progress reports annually on implementation. In addition, Departments must set performance indicators in their new customer action plans to allow for the assessment and measurement of how targets and these standards have been met.</P>
      <P>In 1999, I launched guidelines on public service web publication prepared by an interdepartmental group set up to examine good practice principles for public service websites. Its report contains a range of recommendations. Recommendation 10.3 stipulates that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> Correspondence received by e-mail should be answered as quickly as possible. Procedures for answering e-mail, including targets, should be set out in customer service statements.</P>
    <P>This issue is being addressed in the context of quality customer service. The issue of setting specific standards in relation to queries arriving by e-mail or through departmental websites is currently under consideration by a sub-group of the QCS working group.</P>
    <P>Within my Department, under our QCS standards, staff aim to provide a substantive response to 70% of correspondence, including e-mails, within 15 working days of receipt. Where it is not possible to issue a full reply within 15 working days, it is my Department's policy to advise the correspondent as to when it will be possible to issue such a response. In practice, most e-mail queries received by the webmaster in my Department are responded to on the same day.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received representations regarding the decision to abolish the PRSI contribution ceiling for employers, as announced in my Budget Statement. However, I do not propose to alter that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated at the time of the announcement, the PRSI changes should be viewed in the context of the significant improvement in the business climate. Although not all businesses have benefited from the significant corporation tax reductions achieved in recent years, many have done so. In addition, the substantial improvement I announced in the budget in the capital allowances for plant and machinery will benefit a wide range of enterprises. Moreover, our employer PRSI system continues to compare favourably with the EU norm. Overall, therefore, <Col N="1171" /> the environment for business continues to be very positive.</P>
    <P>I have already signalled my intention to press ahead with the reform and simplification of the PRSI and levies system which has become particularly complex over the years. In progressing this agenda in my next budget, I will take into consideration the concerns expressed by the various employer interests.</P>

In the most recent budget I made some significant changes, such as the abolition of the employer's ceiling and &ndash; something that received less attention &ndash; abolition of the ceiling for self-employed and proprietary directors, while reducing the rate in that regard. The PRSI and levies system is complex, with steps, ceilings and other innovations which were introduced over the years. The last budget should be seen in the context of continuing reform. Hopefully, after the budget later this year, people will be pleased with the overall result.</P>

      <P>I have long held the view that this is an anachronism. This will be a short tax year, so only a small percentage of employees will earn in excess of £36,000 by 31 December 2001. A new tax year will then start due to the alignment of the tax and calendar years and people should wait to see what my budget later this year will bring in terms of further PRSI reform.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what the Deputy said in that this is a valuable resource. Due consideration has to be given as to the <Col N="1173" /> appropriate fee. The director first contacted my Department in December 2000. My consent to the director's fee proposals was originally sought on 7 December and I replied to her on 20 December. There have been ongoing contacts between our officials since then.</P>
      <P>I offered to meet the director on 1 or 2 February. A meeting was set up but deferred at her request. Another meeting was arranged for last Friday, 16 February, which was again postponed at the director's request. I am due to meet the director tomorrow morning. This is a serious matter. I agree with Deputy McDowell that it is important to get an early decision but it is more important to get the right decision.</P>

      <P>Income tax policy for a particular year is decided on by Government as part of <Col N="1174" /> its consideration of the budget and the Finance Bill. In that context the Government will have regard to its ongoing programme, to the agreements contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and to the policies put before the electorate in 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's suggestion regarding the issuing of shares in a national investment fund which could not be cashed for a number of years, he will now be aware of the proposal I announced last week on publication of the Finance Bill regarding a new incentive for individuals to save. My proposal, which has been widely welcomed, is a real incentive for people to lock away some of their disposable income for a five-year period. Effectively, what is on offer is a £1 contribution from the Exchequer for every £4 that an individual saves. Anyone over 18 can participate in the scheme so long as a minimum of £10 per month is saved and provided he or she is an Irish resident. Full details of the scheme were provided in the press release on the Finance Bill, 2001, published last Thursday.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to encourage substantial regular savings by all. Additional savings will reduce demand in the economy and the scheme will encourage many new savers to provide for the rainy day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since last June or July I have received a number of representations regarding possible savings incentives, many of which I have considered. A proposal along the lines suggested was put forward by participants in the review of the PPF. However, the trade unions did not proceed with this suggestion in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Department has examined each scheme. The scheme I announced last week is my best effort at innovation in savings and will be included in the Finance Bill. Other methods may be considered in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has two objectives with which I agree, namely, to share the country's wealth with taxpayers by giving some tax rebates and to encourage savings. However, there are two problems with the savings scheme to which he referred in his reply. First, the cost to the Exchequer is unquantifiable and, second, the extent to which it will encourage savings is also unquantifiable</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the difficulty with the scheme suggested in the question is that it is more or less involuntary. One must take into account that we have commitments to the electorate and the partners in the PPF. Ideas such as that suggested by the Deputy were discussed by some of the social partners on the trade union side. However, other trade unions strongly held the view that there were commitments regarding wages and taxation and that individuals should be <Col N="1175" /> able to decide what to do with their money. All this must be borne in mind when deciding on tax changes in a budget.</P>
      <P>I announced in the budget that I would bring forward ideas regarding savings and I have tried to allow individuals to decide for themselves as to the amount they put aside for a rainy day. I am not saying that I have exclusive rights to genius in this regard. The intention is to encourage people to get into the habit of saving again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the Minister's two pronged proposal, namely, the tax concessions and his scheme to encourage savings, is that it is at cross purposes. One of the difficulties with the scheme is that it is aimed at stopping people from spending the tax concessions given in the budget. The other difficulty, as the Minister now acknowledges, is that neither the cost of the scheme nor the amount of savings likely to accrue from it is quantifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not aimed at stopping people from spending their money but at encouraging people to save. If we went to the social partners and the workers and said we will give tax reductions but we will not give them now, I am sure many workers would rise up against that. That type of idea was floated about. I am not saying it does not have merits but we live in a free society where workers demand their share of the wealth and they should decide what to do with it. My scheme is endeavouring to encourage people to put money aside in the form of savings. It is an innovative way of doing it because it has exactly the same effect as giving people a £3,000 allowance at the standard tax rate. However, it is more attractive to put a maximum of £200 aside every month and for the Government to add another £600 to it. The commitments given in the PPF and in our election programme must be borne in mind. This is a voluntary act by the individual to put money aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister had some estimate of the cost of the scheme before he introduced it. Different options will give rise to different costs. What are those options and costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a difficult mathematical exercise to work out what the tax loss will be to the Exchequer if a certain amount of money is put aside by individuals over the year. We can guess the numbers of people who will be incentivised by this scheme. From the figures I have seen it seems the number of people saving regularly is not in proportion with their earnings. It depends on the numbers taking up the scheme, the different income strata of those taking it up and the amount of money they are willing to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have any great empirical evidence in that regard. Our best estimate is £100 million in a full year. However, that is on the basis that <Col N="1176" /> £400 million will be put aside in these savings schemes. It depends on the uptake.</P>

      <P>Article 19.1 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, states that &ldquo;The Governor shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.&rdquo; Last week the Government decided to seek the reappointment of the current governor, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, for a further term in office. A key factor in making this recommendation to the President was my desire that the current governor would continue in office to oversee the transition to the euro, which will be implemented early next year. As the 1942 Act provides for reappointment, no additional legislation is required. The governor has agreed to his reappointment to oversee the introduction of the new currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The governor has been appointed for a full term. In deciding the best course of action to take and cognisant of the Government's wish not to serve a full second term, my Department consulted the European Central Bank's legal services on the possibility of passing specific legislation which would enable the extension of the governor's current term. The view of the ECB was that Article 14.2 in the statute of the European system of central banks and of the European Central Bank, which provides the term in office of a governor of a national central bank shall be no less than five years, precluded such a possibility. However, there was and is no obstacle to renewing the governor's term for a further seven years. That is the course of action the Government proposed to the president. It is entirely a matter for the governor if he wishes to avail of the seven year term. It is the desire of the Government that the governor, Maurice O'Connell, would be the person <i>in situ </i>for the changeover to the euro which occurs on 1 January next year. The dual circulation period ends on 9 February. It is the desire of the Government that Mr. O'Connell would remain as governor to oversee <Col N="1177" /> the transition. The simplest thing to do is to reappoint the governor for a full term. However, the governor's wish is not to serve a full term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the CPSU is balloting its members on the adjustment to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed between the employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 4 December 2000. The PPF is the latest in a series of national pro<Col N="1178" /> grammes negotiated, ratified and accepted by the Government, employers and private and public sector employees and groups representing a wide range of interests within the community. It comprises an integrated package of agreed objectives on income, economic and social policy developments. The partnership process which underlies these programmes has been the single most influential factor in bringing about our present economic well being.</P>
      <P>I understand the CPSU concern is about pay. In addition to the adequate pay terms of the PPF, a fundamental part of the programme as far as the public service is concerned is the provision for a benchmarking exercise which will carry out a comparative examination of pay and jobs in the public and private sectors. Effectively this will deliver a pay review for the public service. Practically all the major public service groups, including grades represented by the CPSU, are being directly considered in this exercise.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the PPF and the benchmarking exercise represent the best means whereby the CPSU can address its concerns about pay. Any alternative pay mechanism for the CPSU would clearly not be in the public interest given the inevitable implications which it would have for public service pay policy, the entire national partnership process and associated budgetary policy. I urge the CPSU and its members to remain within the framework of the PPF and to use the benchmarking exercise constructively to deal with their pay aspirations within the partnership process.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to wish my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, well in his tenure as spokesperson on finance.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it would be disastrous &ndash; that is not overstating the point &ndash; if the CPSU, as the representative of the bulk of civil servants, withdrew from the framework of the PPF? Does he also agree the pay offered at recruitment grades, for example clerical officers in the Civil Service, is wholly inadequate and that that is at the base of the current dispute? Does he agree the reaction of the CPSU in that context to the Buckley report was understandable and will he outline what he intends to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already agreed to an improvement in the entry points of clerical and other recruitment scales by the removal of age points. In its terms of reference the benchmarking body is specifically asked to have regard to the need to recruit and retain staff. The Buckley report, to which the Deputy referred, is as good an example as one can get, and is very much akin to the benchmarking process. That was pointed out by many members of ICTU when the Buckley report was published. I appeal to the CPSU to remain within the PPF. In any event, there is no alternative to the benchmarking exercise for any public service group wishing to pursue its claim in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> An amendment was agreed in the revised PPF last December which provided that 25% of any increases arising from the report of the benchmarking body would be backdated to 1 December 2001. Therefore, in 2002 when the benchmarking body will report, it was agreed in the revised PPF that 25% of any increase applying to a group would be effectively backdated to 1 December and that details of the balance of whatever increases were granted would be worked out.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is a pity the impression appears to have been created that benchmarking is a matter for higher paid civil servants and professionals within the civil service, although that is not the case? The SMI process and the delivery of a better service which I hope goes with that, applies to all grades within the civil service. Would the Minister agree that any elaboration of a gain sharing system within the civil service has to apply to all grades, including entry grades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comment that the benchmarking process is not just for the higher groups, it applies throughout the public service. It is hard to blame some people in the CPSU, however, when that point has not been got across sufficiently to learned people in other professions who do not seem to have taken on board what the benchmarking body is supposed to be about. That is despite the good selling that has taken place on the benchmarking body by the Congress of Trade Unions and its constituent unions. There may be a belief abroad that it does not apply to lower grades, but it does. As some-one else put it, it is the only game in town regarding public service pay. I would urge the CPSU to stay within the partnership process and proceed to the benchmarking body.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The regulation of banks is the primary responsibility of the Central Bank. I have been advised by the Central Bank that a bank which is not authorised to carry on banking business within Ireland may not advertise for or otherwise solicit deposits in Ireland. It may not hold itself out or represent itself as a bank here, and to do so would involve a breach of the law. It is a matter for the relevant authorities to establish whether there have been any breaches of Irish legislation in relation to money laundering, as with any other matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the general question of supervising banks which operate here, the law already provides that only banks which are authorised to trade in Ireland may do so. It is a matter for the relevant authorities, including the Central Bank, the Garda Síochána and the DPP, to determine what action to take if the law is broken.</P>

If it can be proved that any institution has broken the law, appropriate action will be taken.

      <P>I understand the Deputy wishes to know whether unclaimed bank drafts are to be included in the dormant accounts scheme. The scheme, as proposed, extends to accounts which have become dormant in financial institutions. It does not extend to items such as uncashed bank drafts, at present. However, when the scheme is up and running, it is my intention that consideration should be given to extending it to other financial products, as appropriate, and I will review the question of bank drafts at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that considerable quantities of money are being held by banks because the people who took out or cashed the bank drafts have died? As the Minister rightly stated, there is no provision in law to hand those amounts over to their next-of-kin. Surely something should be done about that hugely anomalous situation? Has the Minister inquired from the individual banks what the amounts are and, if not, will he do so in order to ensure that families who are entitled to such money will receive it?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, traditionally, bank drafts have been referred to as cash in hand. I am not aware of the legal position if a draft is encashed for whatever reason. However, I will ask the Central Bank to discuss this matter with the banks and to let me know the position. I can foresee considerable difficulty in trying to trace all these bank drafts, and I do not know whether the banks have any idea of the extent of this problem. I am aware that Deputy Timmins has been pursuing this matter. I have read newspaper reports in which he has raised this issue and he also raised the matter with me some time last year.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works completed the purchase of the Swedish Match site in Hammond Lane in December 1999. Since then some preparatory works have taken place. An archaeological assessment has been carried out on the open areas of the site and nothing of any significance was found. A planning application was lodged on 23 January 2001 for demolition of the former Maguire and Paterson buildings and adjoining buildings. A strip of land to the north of the site will be disposed of for the proposed Luas line. The Luas area has been fenced off from the main site. When the site clearance has been completed, subject to planning permission, the Commissioners of Public Works will proceed to shortlist developers to tender for the provision of Government offices on the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the achievements in progressing the objectives of public service reform as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Work is well advanced in the preparation of the next round of departmental strategy statements and new customer service action plans. A performance management and development system, PMDS, for the Civil Service was launched in May 2000 and is now being implemented in Departments and Offices. Achievements in the human resources management area include a programme to tackle short-term staffing problems and a modernised approach to human resource management. A new model of Civil Service recruitment is being developed and the necessary legislation is expected to be published by early 2002. In line with the commitment in the PPF, expenditure on <Col N="1186" /> training and development is being increased and in the Civil Service is expected to reach the target of 4% of payroll by 2003. The implementation of a package of measures to promote gender equality, including targets for the representation of women at higher management grades, is being discussed with the Civil Service unions.</P>
      <P>A number of changes in budgetary and expenditure management arrangements are in place and these are creating an environment favourable to the development of a new management information framework which is at an early stage of development. A package of measures on regulatory reform is being developed to reduce the compliance burden on the business sector and provide easier access and transparency for all citizens. There are a number of initiatives under way to effectively tackle cross-cutting issues, for example, the national anti-poverty strategy, the national children's strategy and the REACH unit to oversee the development of electronic services for the public.</P>
      <P>In the area of electronic service delivery <i>via </i>the Internet, a number of services are now available, for example, the Revenue on-line filing system, a system for access to Land Registry information, a system for accessing job opportunities in FÁS. As part of this ongoing public service IT programme, further developments are planned over the remaining two years of the information society action plan. E-strategies are being prepared by Departments and Offices. These strategies will identify and prioritise the services which will be provided electronically during the lifetime, up to end 2002, of the action plan for the information society. A fund of some £55 million for 2001 is in place to support initiatives that progress the action plan.</P>
      <P>In July 2000 the Government approved the establishment of the new National Centre for Partnership and Performance and, as provided for in the PPF, a review of the partnership process will commence shortly. The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 to examine public service pay and jobs, by comparison with the private sector, and to make recommendation thereon by June 2002.</P>
      <P>The PPF provides for external verification of progress in the modernisation programme. Sectoral quality assurance groups, including external business-customer representation, are in the process of being established for the purpose of providing independent verification of progress of the various strands of the modernisation programme. Progress achieved by 1 April 2002 at individual organisation level is to be reported on and assessed by the relevant quality assurance groups by 1 October 2002 and payment of the final phase of 4% under the PPF will be conditional on satisfactory progress being made in achieving key objectives. These objectives are being agreed at the appropriate organisational level prior to being submitted to the relevant sectoral quality assurance group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will focus on one or two aspects of the Minister's reply. I understood him to say that a performance management system was in place in relevant Departments and offices. Will he confirm that is the case? Does he agree the performance management system was considered a prerequisite for putting in place some form of gain-sharing, of performance related pay within the Civil Service? What is the current state of play in negotiations with the trade unions in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We launched the performance management and development system in May 2000 and it is being implemented in Departments and offices. Successive Ministers have tried to progress the system as the foundation stone of a possible performance pay system. It would be difficult to have one without the other. Slow progress has been made over a number of years on the matter. I would not like to link the development of the performance management system to the question of gain-sharing. While it may be linked in some people's minds, I do not consider that that necessarily will be the case. As I indicated in my press release on the Finance Bill last Thursday, I am well disposed to the idea of gain-sharing in all quarters.</P>
      <P>My Department and the social partners are trying to get some workable definitions to ensure gain-sharing would not be used as a bonus system and a tax avoidance mechanism. Hopefully we will progress the gain-sharing option in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The absence of a gain-sharing system in the public service, and the absence of a profit-sharing system which would apply to the bulk of Irish firms not publicly quoted, means the scheme the Minister announced last week will be seen as focused on a small number of already well paid workers, most of whom work for multi-national corporations. That is not a good thing.</P>

      <Quest>the potential implications for inflation arising from the introduction of the euro; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The changeover to the euro should have no implications for inflation and, to this end, a number of steps have been taken. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the social partners agree that the changeover to the euro cannot be used to justify price increases. The cash changeover plan, which has been signed up to by a wide range of retail organisations, contains a commitment to carry out the changeover to the euro fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
      <P>On 14 December 2000, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, launched a national code on euro changeover. All suppliers of goods and services to consumers are encouraged to subscribe to this code or to a sectoral code approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs. All subscribers to the national code commit to carrying out the changeover to the euro fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill, 2001, which I published on 5 February 2001, provides for the substitution, with effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and statutory instruments. Together with the Finance Bill, 2001, and the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, and other forthcoming legislation, it will provide an appropriate framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002, in the principal areas of law under which citizens regularly transact business with the State.</P>
      <P>In all cases where a change to convenient amounts in euro is considered necessary, the policy is to ensure the change is in favour of the citizen. As the Deputy will be aware, Irish pound amounts in law that are not affected by this national legislation will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate, under council regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in principle, and welcome the legislation he recently introduced. The widespread public view is that the euro changeover will be used by unscrupulous business owners to increase prices. I suggest that temporary additional powers be given to the Director of Consumer Affairs so that as well as investigating, he can impose restrictions on businesses that unjustifiably increase prices during the first six months of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Legislation in this regard would be a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under whose aegis comes the question of consumer protection. <Col N="1189" /> I do not object to the Deputy's suggestion in principle, and proceeding in such a way is still possible. We are keeping in contact with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's office. The belief that the changeover may be used to raise prices artificially stems from what is anecdotally believed to have happened when decimalisation occurred in February 1971.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, Dr. Garret FitzGerald has published an interesting article which challenges the view of what happened in 1971. My Department's analysis of Dr. FitzGerald's article shows that the question cannot be proved either way. It may be that Dr. FitzGerald's contention that widespread inflation did not happen is correct. I agree with Deputy McDowell that there is a belief that this may occur again. There is now greater and more solid competition, so the same dangers may not arise. The matter is being kept under review, but legislation would be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in 1971 was different as we reduced the number of pennies in a pound from 240 to 100, so that any increase after that date was by at least 2.4 old pennies. On this occasion, a cent will be less than a penny in value. We should guard against those who may try to round upwards. The Minister has made provision that public authorities will change in a way that benefits the citizen. Legislation should also ensure businesses will benefit. Any rounding should be down, not up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the desirability of price legislation, a matter of which I am very conscious. I agree with Deputies McDowell and Jim Mitchell that we need to be on our guard. To be fair to Dr. FitzGerald, he was interestingly querying the long held belief of many. He argued that the reasons for the inflation of 1971 were not clearcut. Subsequent examination showed that we cannot prove or disprove Dr. FitzGerald. Deputy Mitchell has outlined the reasons the situation is different coming up to 1 January 2002. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and my colleague in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are on top of these matters.</P>

      <P>For many years, currency exchange has been a source of considerable profits to banks. The number of such transactions will be substantially reduced when the euro becomes our currency, and this profit will no <Col N="1190" /> longer be available to them. I am concerned that banks will make up for losses by charging customers in other areas. Does the Minister agree we need to be particularly vigilant in ensuring this does not happen?</P>

According to the most recent national accounts data published by the Central Statistics Office, which relate to 1999, Gross Domestic Product is estimated to be £69,052 million compared with Gross National Product of £59,068 million, a difference of £9,984 million or 14.4 % of GDP. This compares with a gap of £4,684 million in 1995 which amounted to 11.3 % of GDP.</P>

    <P>

    <P>For 1999 most of this difference relates to the repatriated profits of multinational companies operating in Ireland. The foreign owned sector has made a significant contribution to the economy's transformation over the last 30 years and to the exceptional performance of recent years. According to the IDA's Annual Report for 2000, there were 1,200 overseas companies in Ireland directly employing more than 123,000 people.Adding to this total the indirect employment generated by these companies, it is clear that the foreign owned sector is a crucial sector of the economy. In addition, many of these companies are operating in high growth sectors where the potential exists for continued strong growth in output and employment.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the increase in the gap between GDP and GNP shows the success of Ireland's industrial policy in attracting foreign direct investment. Maintaining this successful policy is a key challenge over the medium term. As a small open economy, sustaining output and employment growth is dependent, <i>inter alia, </i>on our <Col N="1191" /> ability to attract FDI and remain competitive on international markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously saying that most of £10 billion, the difference between GNP and GDP, is one year's repatriated profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the difference is repatriation of profits from multi-national companies.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;bulk&rdquo;&ndash; 70%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact percentage but it is in excess of 50%. It depends on the definition of repatriated profits. It also includes royalty agreements and similar matters. They are all classified as repatriated profits, although there may be statistical differences between the headings. I can get the details for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the increasing gap between GNP and GDP is of concern, particularly in the context of a slow down in the US economy? Will he consider measures beyond what has been done to encourage multinational corporations, particularly those based in the United States, not to repatriate profits to the extent that they do, by, for example, doing more research and development work here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a greater proportion of research and development work of all firms conducted here, especially multi-nationals. I would be more worried if the amount of repatriated profits was not substantial. The level of repatriated profits is a function of the level of foreign direct investment. Hence the higher the investment level, the higher the country's output and consequently an increase of repatriated profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The changeover requires legislation, production of Euro notes and coins, preparations by the public sector and businesses, and widespread public information. Substantial progress has been made and further preparations are in hand.</P>
      <P>Much legislation dealing with the euro has already been put in place at EU level and at national level. More recently, the Euro Change-over (Amounts) Bill, 2001, which I published on 5 February 2001, provides for the substitution, with effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and Statutory Instruments. Together with the Finance Bill, 2001, and the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, and other forthcoming legislation it will provide a framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002, in the principal areas of law under which citizens regularly transact business with the State. Irish pound amounts in law that are not affected by this national legislation will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate, under Council Regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>
      <P>Production of euro banknotes and coins by the Central Bank is on target, while Government Departments confirm that progress on preparations by the public sector is satisfactory. These preparations will continue to be monitored by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign has provided extensive information to help businesses prepare themselves for the changeover. The results of a recent Forfás survey on business preparedness were announced at the national conference at the Loughrea euro town project yesterday. It indicated that preparedness is increasing but there is more to be done. Earlier this month Forfás began fresh radio advertising aimed specifically at business. It will continue on a phased basis. It is continuing its presentations to business, trade and professional organisations as well as participating in exhibitions and conferences aimed at SMEs.</P>
      <P>Consumer matters are for my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for Consumer Affairs, and for the Director of Consumer Affairs. The National Code of Practice on the Euro Changeover was re-launched by them last December, along with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover. Interest in the national code and approved sectoral codes is increasing among retailers. A number of premises have dual price displays on products and till receipts. The level of this will rise sharply closer to 1 October 2001, the date for its commencement under the national and sectoral codes. Other codes on dual display will continue until 9 March 2002, a month after the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland (ECBI) has carried out extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included a leaflet to every household in 1998, 1999 and 2000, widespread circulation of <Col N="1193" /> posters and leaflets, provision of a local inquiry line (1890 201050) and website (www.euro.ie), distribution of information packs to schools and of guidelines to every teacher, provision of material to people with special needs, for example literacy difficulties, and part funding for non-governmental organisations promoting euro awareness. The Euro Changeover Board has run advertising campaigns. A November 2000 public awareness survey by the board showed that 77% knew the year of introduction of euro cash and 83% of these the month. These figures are up on the July survey.</P>
    <P>The date for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish notes and coins, 9 February 2002, was announced last April in the Cash Changeover Plan for 2002, and I expect to bring the necessary Order and resolution for approval of it, before each House of the Oireachtas before Easter. It was decided following extensive consultation and I am satisfied that the period of almost six weeks strikes the right balance between allowing people to adapt to the new currency and avoiding a long period of dual circulation. All euro area member states intend completing the changeover in a period of two months or less and all have indicated that they expect that the bulk of cash transactions will be in euro by the end of two weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that a recent survey showed only 1% of Irish companies' transactions is conducted in euros? This is the lowest in the EU. Only a third of Irish businesses have considered what has to be done to change over at the start of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be preferable if more transactions were carried out in euros and if businesses were more prepared than surveys indicate. Over the past 18 months, awareness has been increasing. I would remind everyone that soon all business will have to be conducted in euros. They should start preparing.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of order. I tabled a Private Notice Question on the general affair concerning the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. I was advised by the Ceann Comhairle's office that the Ceann Comhairle disallowed the Private Notice Question because he felt the issue was too big to be raised by way of a Private Notice Question and that it should be dealt with by way of a more substantive motion. The letter goes on to state that the Taoiseach will make a statement at 4.15 p.m. <Col N="1196" /> However, the Taoiseach did not make a statement; he made an announcement. Before the Order of Business is announced, will the Taoiseach make a further statement relevant to the affair concerning the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and his resignation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot agree to the Order of Business unless it is amended. The Taoiseach has a responsibility to make a statement to the House and to subject himself to questions from the Opposition on the Deputy Ned O'Keeffe affair. This resignation is shrouded in ambiguity. There is a direct conflict between statements made by the former Minister of State with responsibility for food and those made by the Taoiseach. We have tried to raise this issue by way of motion under Standing Order 31 and by way of private notice questions. We have been advised by the Ceann Comhairle's office that it requires a substantive motion. I would settle for less than a substantive motion if the Taoiseach clarified some of the issues by way of a statement and if he allowed the Opposition to put questions. Did he want Deputy O'Keeffe to stay or go? Did he offer to move him to another Department before Christmas? Was it an unspecified employee who put pressure on Deputy O'Keeffe to resign rather than the Taoiseach? Without challenging the Taoiseach's right to remove persons from office if he considers them unfit or unsuitable&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe informed me at 4 p.m. last Friday that because of the events that had occurred overnight in the Public Offices Commission, he thought it better that he continue to protest his innocence and proceed to deal with the matter with his legal representatives before the commission over the coming period; for how long, neither of us know. He asked if he could talk to his family and prepare a statement and that at around lunch time or after on Saturday he would give an interview and resign. He and I agreed there would be no further talk about it. I made one comment on a request from the Government press secretary; I said I would deal with the issue. That was what I agreed with Deputy O'Keeffe. Unfortunately, the statements on Saturday morning upset Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>From my dealings with Deputy O'Keeffe in recent months, the position was as simple as this. Before Christmas Deputy O'Keeffe believed if the Public Offices Commission could deal with the matters quickly that he would be exonerated and that he would not have a difficulty; at one stage he believed the matter could be dealt with quickly in early January through correspondence. That was the view of the senior counsel and solicitor who were dealing with the matter for him. On the basis that he was cleared I had no difficulty in him staying in his post but as we know, things moved on. I told him that I believed that even if he was cleared by the commission, it would be better for him to move on from that Department.</P>
      <P>As events occurred, moving him on did not arise because not only did the commission not complete proceedings, it had to move into formal session. When Deputy O'Keeffe realised&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder could I clarify something the Taoiseach said in relation to the matter we have just disposed of. When did he accept the resignation of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe? Because of the problem with the acoustics in this Chamber, many of the people in the Fourth Estate, who are charged with reporting these proceedings, were unable to hear whether the Taoiseach accepted the resignation at 4.00 p.m. on Friday or on Saturday. In the interests of accuracy, the Taoiseach might like to clarify that point and put it on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other matter, am I to understand the record of the House will show very clearly what the Taoiseach said? Is it in order to take item 21 at this point? Is the Chair aware that the sub-committee on Dáil reform which met to discuss what was originally a Fine Gael motion was not quorate once the Green Party Member, Deputy Gormley, left? This motion has not come through the all-party process as it is required to do and it has not gone to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is without precedent that the two largest parties in this Chamber would, in effect, gang up against every other party and Member to put this through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>By this time the Private Notice Question could have been disposed of and we <Col N="1213" /> would have made more progress. Will the Chair take into account that the item before the House will not deal with an amendment from the Green Party or with an amendment from the Socialist Party and other Independent Members? It will simply deal with one amendment. Does the Chair not agree this is a sham? I welcome the expression of solidarity from the Labour Party. I understand that if we were to have further discussion on this, we could also have an agreement with the Fine Gael Party. This item should not be taken now. The Order Paper is flawed. This will be dealt with inadequately and that will give rise to an incomplete state of affairs which will not be revisited again soon.</P>

    <P>(2)that Dáil Éireann&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>calls on all Parties in the House to expedite the proposals for reform of Dáil procedures currently before the sub-Committee on Dáil Reform, and</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>calls on that sub-Committee to present a formal report on those proposals to the House at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move this resolution to restore the privileges that the Cheann Comhairle bestowed on the House by the ruling of late 1999. I have no hesitation in doing so. In so doing, the Government has accepted word for word the amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party and added two paragraphs to it to the effect that we call on all parties in the House to expedite the proposals for consideration before the sub-committee on Dáil reform, and the sub-committee to present a formal report on them to the House at an early date. We suggest that those additional paragraphs should be added to the Fine Gael motion which we propose to accept. That should cover the matter.</P>
    <P>The background to the motion is that a procedure had evolved whereby the Order of Business was found to be restrictive. Opposition leaders were of the view, rightly, that they wanted the right to put direct questions to the Taoiseach of the day on topical matters on the Order of Business. The Ceann Comhairle of the day took the view, as he was entitled to do, that he would extend the idea of leaders' questions into a formalised arrangement whereby there would be one round of questions followed by supplemen<Col N="1224" /> taries. That persisted for over one year at the end of which his ruling was challenged. Probably as a result of that challenge, or perhaps other factors, he decided that that should be reversed. It is worth noting that in deciding to reverse it, he invited the sub-committee on Dáil reform to introduce a Standing Order which would formalise the latitude for which he had provided. This Standing Order responds to his invitation to introduce such a measure. It is in that spirit that the Government took the same view on the issue as that of Fine Gael, which was simply to restore the privilege the Ceann Comhairle had extended. We have no difficulty in restoring it at this stage because there is a far bigger issue involved.</P>
    <P>I trust that in dealing with the motion we will not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that this House cannot be frozen in time. It is becoming more obvious by the day that this Parliament needs to be reformed and updated and that it requires new procedures. I do not take from the Opposition's right to use any issue as a parliamentary tactic; that is fair game in any parliament. It is a pity, however, that the Opposition has chosen the subject of parliamentary reform on which to impose a veto by not attending meetings of the sub-committee on Dáil reform and by not moving forward with reforms until such time as another issue on the Electoral Bill is dealt with. This is not the occasion on which to have such a debate, however, because my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will be in the Seanad tomorrow to deal with the Electoral Bill, and I do not wish to preempt what he will say.</P>
    <P>The bigger issue is that we need to increase the relevancy of the House. We desperately need to introduce practical measures to update it. The House needs to earn again the respect of those outside it. I do not take from anyone's right to cause the sort of shambles we have witnessed in the last couple of sitting days on the Order of Business, but if anybody thinks that the people are stopping their cars to turn on the radio to listen to incessant wrangling about Standing Orders, we all need to cop on.</P>
    <P>There were good proposals before the sub-committee on Dáil reform from the Fine Gael Party, with an excellent document from the Labour Party. Independent Members have also made some excellent ideas through Deputy Gormley on which real progress was being made. The Government has laid its own document before the sub-committee. Between all those documents there is enough meat to earn again respect for the House. It is a pity that we cannot get back to that matter. The reason the Government hesitated is that a demand was expressed vehemently to restore one particular measure of Dáil reform while ignoring and moving away from the dozens of measures the House requires. This is only a tiny, insignificant reform. If anyone thinks that Opposition leaders are not in a position to get their point across, they are mistaken. They have been well able to do so in recent years. Even when Fianna <Col N="1225" /> Fáil was in Opposition, we did not have great hesitation in getting our point across. One does not have to be that creative to mention a Bill and go on to spend 20 minutes dealing with an issue which may have nothing to do with that legislation. We are codding ourselves.</P>
    <P>One of the ideas I put before the sub-committee on Dáil reform was to have a new current issues time slot, although I hasten to add nothing formal was agreed in that respect. I understood that all parties would consider my idea that every Minister could be questioned on the Order of Business without notice every morning. This is done in Canada and other parliaments and it represents real accountability. Anyone could ask the Minister for Health and Children what was happening in hospitals, ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what was happening in Garda stations, and ask questions of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed all those ideas, but the process has been stalled. That Standing Order could be put through immediately. I have also proposed in the document &ndash; there  has not been any huge objection &ndash; that we should install electronic voting on these benches. That would not take away from the necessity to have the odd traditional vote, but we could install the new system. We could use it when there are five or six votes in a row or we are here until midnight. We can introduce that modern system. We lecture the country about e-commerce, but we do not have it in this House.</P>
      <P>I proposed that Independent Members should be able to table priority questions, Private Members' motions and private notice questions and have formal speaking rights in debates whereby they would be allocated the standard time to take part in all discussions and be able to question each Minister. While that is provided for in the document, the process is stalled because the Dáil reform committee cannot be properly assembled. I am not interested in a Dáil reform committee which will be run on the basis of who has the most votes. If we politicise Dáil reform, we will all retreat into the trenches, the introduction of Dáil reform will be deferred until the next Government, the members of which may take the same view and off we will go again. Alternatively, we could depoliticise it and take the view that this is a bigger issue to do with the future of Parliament, a new century, a new millennium, new systems, proper accountability and a real role for Independent Members and smaller parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some fine proposals in the Fine Gael and Labour Party documents, such as allowing the television cameras to pan the House to show who is and is not responding. Taken together, the reforms advanced by the main parties and Independent Members are exciting. It is a parliamentary tragedy that we are not in a position to <Col N="1226" /> advance them. We are not in a position to do so because we have got bogged down in political argy-bargy which bedevilled the last five or six attempts to introduce Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in these reforms. They were included in successive Opposition documents. Each time they were introduced, the Minister of the day said that he or she would like to proceed with them, which everyone said was a good idea, but they were not progressed.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about cleaning up politics, reforming the House, making people accountable and zoning in on one tiny fraction of a Standing Order, which makes little difference. Let us be conscious of what we are doing. The next group of Deputies who will inherit this Chamber in the next general election, whoever they may be, will inherit a past century Parliament without the issue of parliamentary reform having been tackled.</P>
    <P>I invite all parties to return to the Dáil reform committee where these measures can be advanced. Let us fight the other battles on the electoral and other Bills separately. It is regrettable that Dáil reform is being selected as a lever to deal with other matters when it is the one issue on which we should unite. No one else will reform this House. If we do not reform it together, on an all-party basis, it will never be reformed. It would be a dreadful pity if that were to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his statement, with most of which I concur. His comments illustrate that there is a willingness among Deputies on all sides to consider the over-all picture and to move in the direction of proper Dáil reform at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>It is an appropriate evening on which to discuss the motion for which one hour has been allocated. Anyone who has tuned in to the proceedings of the past two hours will realise that we do not have the answer to the question relating to the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, which the whole country is asking, from a political perspective, and which Opposition Members spent two hours attempting to raise. That is clear proof that we must reform our procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>As Whip of the Fine Gael Party, my primary duty is to be as responsive as I can to my parliamentary colleagues and party Leader, Deputy Noonan. In almost my first role as Fine Gael Whip, it is unfortunate that I must take a stance to defend my rights and those of my parliamentary colleagues, including my leader, to challenge the Government on a daily basis on topical matters, such as he attempted to do earlier despite being ruled out of order continually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the decision the Ceann Comhairle, in his wisdom, made, which he had every entitlement to make, a fortnight ago, Opposition members and leaders have been prevented from tackling the Taoiseach on urgent and important issues in the House on a daily basis. That decision will silence the new leader of the Fine Gael Party <Col N="1227" /> and, as a result, protect the Taoiseach and his Ministers from answering difficult questions which the country demands should be answered by the Government. The effect of the Chair's decision, if not overturned, will be to make the Dáil even more irrelevant. Anyone who viewed the proceedings of the House during the past two hours will wonder how relevant is our national Parliament when the question that everyone, from a political perspective, was asking over the weekend went unanswered. We have become irrelevant. Unless we can make progress on issues such as Dáil reform, we will continue to remain irrelevant to the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party supports taking a step back to where we were a fortnight ago. In no way would that be adequate, but at least it would allow the leaders of Opposition parties to speak on a daily basis on the issues that matter. It would not be Dáil reform by any means. It would be a small step, but in taking that step back to what is now known as the <i>status quo ante, </i>we would be able to move forward in a strong and dynamic fashion. I respect fully the right of every Member elected by the people to this House to speak for his or her constituents and party, but my responsibility as Fine Gael Whip is to ensure the party and its leader are heard on the issues that matter to us. The former leader of my party, Deputy Bruton, could raise topical issues on a daily basis until a fortnight ago, but that has changed. As a matter of urgency, we must revert to that position. I must ensure the leader of the my party is allowed the same opportunity to raise important issues, such as the health service, the housing crisis, equality in education and across society and corporate funding. Those are issues that need to be raised on a regular basis in Dáil Éireann by the leaders of the various Opposition parties. By reverting to the position that prevailed a fortnight ago, we would, at least, make a small, but important step in that direction.</P>
    <P>What we are discussing is not Dáil reform, but only a small step in that direction. My party has strong policies on Dáil reform. I am glad that the Minister of State acknowledged this. The deputy leader of my party, Deputy Mitchell, and the former party leader, Deputy Bruton, produced a far-reaching document, A Democratic Revolution, in recent weeks, which sets out the type of Dáil reform Fine Gael would like to see implemented. We want this Chamber to be responsive to the needs, requests and concerns of the people. I am sure that aspiration is shared by every Deputy. The decision taken a fortnight ago must be reversed in the interests of good order in the House and the entitlement of party leaders to strongly assert their rights and the entitlements they should have.</P>
    <P>The proposals before the committee on Dáil reform put forward by all parties, if implemented, could introduce real change in the way the House works. We are all aware from our constituents of the growing disinterest in politics among the <Col N="1228" /> population, particularly among young people. Unless we can make it clear that Dáil Éireann works, that it can respond on a daily basis to the pressing political needs of the day, in the minds of the majority we will continue to be a laughing stock.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a genuine, open and full debate at the earliest possible date on the issue of Dáil reform. It was because of Deputy Noonan's concern for restoring trust in politics that he announced a difficult and far-reaching decision a fortnight ago. For many months, we have spoken about breaking the link between business and politics and tackling head-on the issue of corporate funding of political parties. Deputy Noonan has decided that Fine Gael will no longer accept corporate donations. Such decisions are necessary if we are to show that there is no undue link between business and politics, if we want to rebuild trust in politics and if we want electors to believe their vote is equal to that of others. The funding of politics is hugely important in the context of Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>Without being patronising, my colleagues and I appreciate the concerns of the Labour Party regarding the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's changes to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. I see it as nothing but a bare-faced attempt to buy the next election, which will not be successful. It sets a dangerous precedent which needs to be tackled head-on. I am aware that there has been no progress on legislation before the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government. My party supports the request that the committee make urgent progress.</P>
    <P>Our opinions on this side of the House on the substantive matters are similar. We recognise that trust in politics must be restored and that a clear and precise end must be brought to the link between business and politics. This House should conduct its business in an open, transparent and responsive fashion. By stepping back to where we were a fortnight ago and by discussing the area of Dáil reform we could make progress.</P>
    <P>My party supports the amendment because our party leader needs a daily entitlement to speak about the issues that matter to people across the country without fear of interruption or being ruled out of order. We support it because we genuinely believe that the parties in this House have progressive policies on Dáil reform which should be implemented. They cannot be implemented until we work together. I respect the rights of all parties in this House. Until we discuss a better way of doing business, we will have more days like today, when we spent two hours failing to discuss the political topic which everyone demanded should be discussed. We allowed the Taoiseach to walk out after two hours without telling the House anything about the scandal concerning Deputy O'Keeffe. If we are to bring to an end the days of political darkness, we need to progress Dáil reform as a matter of urgency. I call <Col N="1229" /> on my colleagues to work in unison to make it a reality.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, noting&ndash;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a)the problems created for the Ceann Comhairle, the Government and parties and Deputies in opposition arising from difficulties of interpretation of Standing Order 26 relating to the Order of Business;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b)that the current proposal for amendment to Standing Order 26 emerged from a bilateral meeting between the Whips of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;c)that under Standing Order 91(1)(f2&gt;a) the Committee on Committee on Procedure and Privileges is required &lsquo;to consider matters of procedure generally and to recommend any additions or amendments to Standing Orders that may be deemed necessary';</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;d)that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is broadly representative of the membership of the House; requests the Ceann Comhairle to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the earliest possible opportunity to consider the Order of Business generally and make recommendations for procedures that would provide both order and uphold the democratic right of Opposition parties and Deputies, including those who are not members of a group as defined under Standing Order 106, to oppose, challenge, question and demand accountability of Government;</P>
      <P>and, pending the receipt of such recommendations from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, urges the Ceann Comhairle to reinstitute the informal procedure of leaders' questions which the Chair had operated up to 7 February 2001; and&ndash;</P>
      <P>further noting the urgent necessity of reform of Dáil procedures and political reform generally to re-establish public confidence in the democratic system;</P>
      <P>deploring the decision by the Government to undermine the impact of the Electoral Act, 1997, through proposals that would increase by almost £1 million the amount the Fianna Fáil Party would be permitted to spend at the next general election;</P>
      <P>believing that it would be hypocritical to co-operate on Dáil reform proposals with a Government that is intent on forcing through an increase of up to 50% in the permitted spend at elections;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> calls on all Opposition parties and Deputies to withhold co-operation from the Government on Dáil reform proposals until such time as the spending proposals are withdrawn;</P>
    <P>and, further believing that the ending of corporate funding of politics is essential to the restoration of public confidence in politics, resolves that the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government shall, in accordance with Standing Order 79B, send a message to the Dáil in relation to completion of its consideration of the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000, not later than the last day on which the House shall sit before the Easter recess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The issue we discuss may appear to people outside the House a rather technical matter that does not mean much to them. I have heard journalists describe it as an in-house matter that is of no interest to anyone other than ourselves, but what we are discussing is a vitally important issue that is central to our democratic system and the right of those in opposition, both parties and individual Deputies, to oppose, to challenge, question and demand accountability of the Government.</P>
    <P>Problems about the Order of Business are not new. There have been problems for as long as I have been a Member of this House, and I have seen it from both sides. The Order of Business has often been ragged, untidy and unsatisfactory, but it is a vitally important part of Dáil business and provides one of the few opportunities for Deputies to raise issues of current interest.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has, in recent weeks, attempted to rewrite recent political history by suggesting that there were never any problems on the Order of Business until the lifetime of this Government. If one was to believe the Taoiseach, during the term of office of the rainbow Government Fianna Fáil asked a few respectful questions about pending legislation and after a few minutes we went off about our business. A glance at the Dáil record for the period in question will show a different picture: one that is not dramatically different from the record of this Dáil. I acknowledge that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, has contradicted the Taoiseach and stated the correct position in relation to our own experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The one change made during the lifetime of this Dáil was the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to place on a more formal basis the practice in recent years, to one degree or another, of allowing the leaders of the principal parties in opposition to put questions to the Taoiseach on matters of current interest. While I welcomed this development, as one of the beneficiaries of the process, I was concerned that this innovation was <Col N="1231" /> being used to further exclude Deputies from any meaningful role on the Order of Business, not just colleagues of mine in the Labour Party, but also the bulk of Fine Gael Deputies, Independent Members and Deputies of smaller parties who are not members of recognised groups.</P>
      <P>Despite these problems, I was surprised that the Ceann Comhairle considered it necessary to make the statement he did on 7 February terminating without notice the facility of leaders' questions. In my experience the Order of Business during the lifetime of this Dáil has been conducted in a relatively restrained manner. Any disorder that there may have been from time to time was no greater and, on many occasions, less than that experienced in previous Dáileanna.</P>
      <P>The interests of democracy will not be furthered if the Standing Orders of this House are framed in such a way as to unreasonably inhibit the Opposition from fulfilling the role it must play in a democratic society. Robust exchanges between Government and Opposition are an essential component of any parliamentary democracy. The Chair should be in a position to manage robust exchanges between Government and Opposition in a manner that is fair and impartial to all Deputies.</P>
      <P>We will not be serving the interests of democracy if we introduce procedures which stifle the Opposition and reduce important set pieces, such as the Order of Business, to some sort of polite, parliamentary tea-party. I intend no reflection on the Ceann Comhairle, or those who previously held that high office, when I say that the Chair as an institution, including those who advise the Chair, tend to stress the need for Standing Orders that are neat and tidy. Far greater emphasis is placed on good order than on ensuring accountability of Government. The interests of democracy are not always served by Standing Orders that provide only for a neat and tidy approach. If the price of ensuring an effective role for the Opposition and some degree of accountability of Government is a degree of untidiness and dis-order, it is a price we should all be prepared to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Ceann Comhairle made his statement to the Dáil on 7 February he suggested that the Dáil reform sub-committee should meet to prepare a new Standing Order to govern the Order of Business. On the same day I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle indicating that, although this was public knowledge, the Labour Party had some weeks earlier withdrawn from that committee. We had taken that decision because of the decision of the Government to introduce the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which provides for increases of up to 50% in the amount that may be spent by candidates in a general election. This Bill will allow Fianna Fáil to spend an additional £1 million at the next general election, on top of the £2 million that it can currently spend. It will greatly increase its capacity to try to buy its way <Col N="1232" /> back into power; that is the sole motivation behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party regards the defeat of this proposal as crucial to the future health of our democracy. The decision of the Government to introduce this measure, coupled with its determination to defend to the death its right to accept corporate donations by blocking the Labour Party Private Members' Bill to outlaw corporate funding, shows that Fianna Fáil has learned nothing from the tribunals of inquiry. It would be hypocritical to co-operate in Dáil reform with Fianna Fáil while ignoring its efforts to further demean and devalue politics by tearing up reforms introduced in the 1997 Electoral Act and providing for such a huge increase in permitted spending limits. We see little point in debating the issue of Dáil reform with a Government which is seeking to further corrupt the electoral process.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party withdrew from what purported to be a meeting of the Dáil reform sub-committee last week. Following the withdrawal of the Green Party representative, only representatives of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were present. Apparently, the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Whips agreed to bring to the House the proposed amendment to Standing Orders. This is a proposal originally tabled by the Fine Gael Party immediately after the Ceann Comhairle's statement of 7 February. Fine Gael made a serious error of judgment in tabling it. It fell into a trap set for it by Fianna Fáil. This controversy coincided with a change of leadership in Fine Gael, a change of Whip and the appointment of a new Front Bench. It is understandable if the eye was off the ball.</P>
    <P>While the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael proposal will provide for a limited degree of latitude for the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, it will institutionalise the exclusion of everyone else from a role on the Order of Business. It will exclude not just Independent Members and members of smaller parties, but all my Front Bench, the Fine Gael Front Bench and all its backbenchers.</P>
    <P>Did anyone in Fine Gael ask why its proposal for this new Standing Order was taken on board with such enthusiasm and alacrity by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats? The answer, as they must know by now, is that the new Standing Order suits the Government. They knew that they could not write a better one.</P>
    <P>The Government's motivation in seeking a new Standing Order is the success of the Labour Party in harrying and embarrassing the Government, in particular, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, over the extraordinary decision to give a Bill, the purpose of which is to increase electoral spending, priority over other much more important legislation promised by his Department. Fianna Fáil has been under the cosh and it does not like it. It knows that this will be more difficult if this Standing Order is introduced. It will provide it with <Col N="1233" /> protection against any sustained effort by the Opposition on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the new leader of Fine Gael to join the Labour Party in seeking to bring to an end corporate funding. I also welcome the support he has given on the Order of Business in the past two weeks in ensuring Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats cannot prevent the committee from considering the Labour Party Bill to ban corporate funding. It has an opportunity to put further pressure on the Government by supporting our amendment which seeks to ensure the committee will complete its consideration of the Bill by the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I urge Fine Gael to reconsider its approach on this matter. Does it want to stand shoulder to shoulder with Fianna Fáil, to troop through the lobbies with it to vote against all their colleagues in opposition? What sort of message will that send to the electorate?</P>
    <P>The motion should be withdrawn. The Labour Party amendment which seeks to refer the contentious matter of the Order of Business to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take issue publicly with Deputy Quinn's comments, but he should read paragraph <i>(b), </i>which he states represents such a departure from the norm as to restrict members of his and our Front Bench. The motion allows questions from any Member about business on the Order Paper, the taking of business which has been promised, including legislation promised inside or outside the Dáil, the making of secondary legislation, arrangements for sittings, when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House will be circulated provided that the Taoiseach may defer replying to a question relating to the making of secondary legislation to another day.</P>
      <P>If one deals with issues of substance, one should do so by reflecting accurately what is before the House. I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour Party, having made misrepresentative comments, has left the Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Standing Orders with reference to leaders' questions. The subject under discussion is a request for a return to the <i>status quo </i>where the Ceann Comhairle allowed the leaders of the Opposition parties to raise topical matters with the Taoiseach and ask brief supplementary questions. This was the practice until three weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I recognise the wider need for formally and substantially altering Standing Orders to enable the House to become more relevant and interesting to the public and those who report and inform the public on the business conducted in the Chamber. While general Dáil reform questions are being thrashed out by Opposition and Government parties at the sub-committee on Dáil reform &ndash; although that is being stalled &ndash; the right of party leaders to raise relevant matters of public interest on the Order of Business each day should not be hampered. I am still unclear as to the reason the Ceann Comhairle decided to discontinue the provision of latitude in this area for party leaders. He was, however, within his rights to do so under Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>The important issue for the Fine Gael Party in the immediate future is that our new leader, who is connecting effectively with the public, can continue to make politics relevant in the House. The Order of Business is one of the ways in which he can do so. Deputy Noonan's predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, had the opportunity to raise rel-evant questions each day and used this facility to good effect. There is no reason this facility should not continue under a new leadership and structure in the party.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Standing Order relates to ensuring the Order of Business is relevant to those outside the House while the wider issue of the need for Dáil reform is addressed by all parties in the House. I understand the Labour Party's annoyance at the Fianna Fáil Party's proposals to increase funding for the next general election.</P>

      <P>The motion is a small step towards reintroducing the ability of party leaders to raise issues, no more and no less. It is not, as the leader of the Labour Party said, about trooping through the gates with Fianna Fáil, shoulder to shoulder, but about ensuring the Leader of the Opposition can raise topical issues. Dáil reform is a bigger issue that needs to be advanced in order that the House can be modernised and become more relevant to the people outside. I regret that the Labour Party has decided not to participate and use delaying tactics in this regard. The House's endeavours to become more relevant will be delayed as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the comments of my party's Chief Whip, Deputy Bradford. There was a prime example of the failure of the House to be relevant today for almost two hours. Anybody who has any interest in political life wants certain questions relating to the affair involving Deputy Ned O'Keeffe answered, but the House wasted two valuable hours trying to get them today.

      <P>It is a dangerous and bad precedent that the two largest parties in the House should <Col N="1238" /> combine and seek to impose any form of change to Standing Orders. The previous practice was that all the parties sat on a statutory committee of the House to consider changes and its findings were usually referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That did not occur in this case. The committee did not sit because the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party do not constitute a committee of which the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats are members.</P>

      <P>The fact that the matter was not referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is of concern. The Labour Party questions whether the procedure adopted was in order.</P>
      <P>The second part of the motion was tabled by the Government and it is inexplicably supported by the Fine Gael Party. It is impertinent of an Opposition party to tell another Opposition party what it should do or to make suggestions about what it should do on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>We do not need advice from the Fine Gael Party or the Government on our tactics concerning Dáil reform. We made a decision on the matter and it is a severe transgression of the usual behaviour between Opposition parties in the House for the Fine Gael Party to attempt to advise the Labour Party on what it should do. The Labour Party withdrew for the good reason that we believed that we would be dealing with a farce. We would be rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic </i>while the Fianna Fáil Party, through its money Bill, would be giving itself an extra £1 million in another part of the House to buy seats and keep us in opposition. Even if the two parties combined, we would not have the reforms we wanted as long as the Fianna Fáil Party was allowed to do that. We used it as a genuine tactic to try to prevent that happening. We sought and were promised Fine Gael support. I reject the arguments being made by the former Fine Gael Chief Whip that we are practising abstentionism after he promised us Fine Gael support for the tactic.</P>

      <P>This is a cynical and shameful carveup by the bigger parties. It is about allowing the Establishment parties to continue to rule. It has always been thus in this Parliament.</P>
      <P>Many do not understand that the smaller parties do not have access to Private Members' time or priority questions. We cannot make contributions on the Order of Business with the party leaders of the so-called groups. That is undemocratic. Are Members of this Parliament saying that that is democracy? If so, they are ignoring a fundamental right. We must seek election like everybody else. I had to endure a long count and won by 27 votes in the end, each one of which was hard earned.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the background to this motion because Deputy Flanagan took me to task for misrepresenting him. At the request of Deputy Joe Higgins, I attended the sub-committee to represent the interests of smaller parties and Independent Members at which my proposals were rejected by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, and Deputy Flanagan. The green voice about which Deputy Coveney spoke has, therefore, been silenced.</P>
      <P>I do not want to appear unduly ungrateful to Fine Gael which invited me to its birthday bash for the former Taoiseach, Garret Fitzgerald, on Saturday. The food was good, the wine even better and company, as always, exhilarating.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be insulted by Fine Gael Members who are acting cleverly. It is a clever piece. They think that they can pull the wool over people's eyes, but it will not work. It will backfire because one must remember that after hubris comes nemesis. I ask them to reflect on the famous meeting between Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Spring in the Shelbourne Hotel following the 1992 general election where there was a slight rebuff. Deputy Flanagan talks with such confidence of Deputy Noonan sitting opposite as Taoiseach, but where will he get the numbers? He may think that Fine Gael is on a roll and that it will have an adequate number of seats, but I suspect that it will require the help of others. He should think about that.</P>
      <P>The Government Chief Whip talks of Dáil reform and I welcome some of the changes about which he has spoken. I welcome his proposal that we should have access to priority questions and Private Members' time. I would also welcome the introduction of electronic voting which I have advocated for some time, but I suspect that it will be introduced in such a way that exclusion will continue. What I require from him is a concrete proposal in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to Dáil reform is accountability. The Minister of State talks about raising topical issues with a Minister, but if a Minister picks out a spot on the ceiling and starts talking rubbish, what can <Col N="1240" /> we do? We have witnessed Ministers do this time and again. I asked the Minister for Defence many questions last week to which I did not receive a proper answer. The Taoiseach has misled me on an issue which some might regard as trivial, but which I regard as important, the issue of plastic bags. He misled the House, but no action was taken. He can get away with it. The Minister of State can reform the Dáil, but if there is no accountability, there will continue to be scandals and tribunals. If the Minister of State does not address this, he should forget about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Government, which is comprised of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, and Fine Gael are shamefully conspiring to suppress the voices of Deputies of small political parties and Independent anti-Establishment Members by denying them the right to question the Taoiseach and to hold the Government responsible on critical issues of the day on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>There is on the Order Paper a reasonable proposal in my name that one member of an informal grouping of six Deputies &ndash; Deputies Sargent and Gormley of the Green Party, Deputy Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party, Deputy Ó Caoláin of Sinn Féin, and Deputies Gregory and Healy, the Independent Left and community candidates &ndash; should have the right on a daily basis to pose questions to the Taoiseach on issues of topical importance. That is an extremely reasonable position to take.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is joining Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to crush a voice from the anti-Establishment section of the House, the Left, because they all share the same consensus politics and economics, support the capitalist Establishment and the <i>status qu</i>o. The differences of philosophy and programme between them are minuscule. It comes down to which cabal among them can get its claws on the levers of power and disperse the perks and privileges to which they are so wedded. Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael do not want a critique from anybody outside this narrow consensus in so far as they can avoid it.</P>
      <P>We have shown that we can ask the awkward questions and offer the alternatives they want to keep hidden. To howls of outrage from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in 1997, the Socialist Party stated in the Dáil that large sums of money donated by business to political parties were as corrupting as large sums of money going donated by business to individual politicians. It has taken Fine Gael three and a half years to jump like an opportunist on the &ldquo;no corporate funding&rdquo; wagon and pretend to be whiter than white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three and a half years ago I indicated from experience how Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil councillors had compromised themselves with contributions from developers and land rezoners on Dublin County Council. It took those two parties two years to institute inquiries which found that dozens of councillors among them had received <Col N="1241" /> barrels of money from land rezoners in a most compromising way.</P>
    <P>The suppression of the voice of the anti-Establishment Deputies, unfortunately, has a long and dishonourable history in the Dáil. John Horgan, in his well researched book on the late Deputy Noel Browne, recounts how the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann were changed in the early 1960s by the major political parties in order to disrupt the extremely incisive input to Dáil business by Mr. Browne and Jack McQuillan, anti-Establishment Deputies belonging to the National Progressive Democrats. They had embarrassed the main right-wing parties to such an extent that restrictions were introduced to try to muzzle them.</P>
    <P>If we had a group of seven, we would be entitled to pose questions. There is a group of six which represents tens of thousands of voters and as such we should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and Deputy Noonan, in particular, are guilty of barefaced hypocrisy. He claimed in the past two weeks that he was silenced and now not only acquiesces in, but, because Fine Gael formulated the motion, supports the silencing of those parties which hold a fundamentally different perspective from him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan fooled nobody this afternoon when he made sweet noises in the direction of the Green Party. It is obvious that he is of the view that he might need that party as a crutch to enter government. He is aware that he will not get a crutch from any Deputy of the Socialist Party or me. We have, therefore, been left out in the cold. The right of minorities and anti-Establishment critics to be heard is being suppressed. If the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, was serious about fairness, he would accept the amendments tabled which would give us the right to question the Taoiseach and the Government on the Order of Business in the same way as the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party. In the meantime, the debate on Dáil reform can continue. It is unjust, undemocratic and wrong that we are excluded. Lest members of Fine Gael run away with themselves with delusions of grandeur, I remind Deputy Noonan that he is not the Leader of the Opposition. There is no such thing in this House. There are leaders of parties in opposition. Deputy Noonan does not speak for me.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister of State and the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party one would think something magnanimous and magnificent was about to happen and that there would be significant and serious Dáil reform. Unfortunately, that is not the case. What is being done is fundamentally undemocratic and unjust. Small parties, Independent Deputies and backbenchers of the main parties are being silenced by this Standing Order proposed by the Government and, unfortunately, supported by Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The essence of democracy is that Members speak for those who elected them in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>About 100,000 votes were cast in the last general election for Independents and small party Deputies. What is happening is the silencing of those who voted for Independents and small parties.</P>
      <P>We hear from Fine Gael that its reason for supporting this Standing Order is its leader has been silenced. One would think that the only way it could have its leader speak in this House was by supporting this Standing Order. Fine Gael could and should take the view that everyone is entitled to speak and that it should be possible for all sides of the House, including the Government, to agree a Standing Order to allow small parties, Independent Members and backbenchers to speak and question the Taoiseach on the Order of Business. Both situations are not mutually exclusive and it would be possible if there was goodwill and the political will to do it.</P>
      <P>Dáil reform is essential. We should lead by example. We are certainly not doing so. Small parties and Independent Deputies are being muzzled. Were we leading by example in paying ourselves more and claiming it as benchmarking when it was not? Are we leading by example in extending and increasing significantly election funding for parties in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill? Are we leading by example in excluding small parties and Independent Members? I appeal to the Government to accept the amendments tabled to this Standing Order.</P>

    <P>a penalty points licensing system;</P>
    <P>a statutory insurance ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Naughten, Coveney, Boylan and Perry.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with one of the most serious issues to come before the House, the fact that so many people are dying on our roads each year, that so many are horribly injured, that the death rate here is twice the <i>per capita </i>rate in Britain, that there is a death every 19 hours on our roads and that this number shows no sign of abating, despite having a very comprehensive national road safety strategy. Scarcely a weekend passes that we do not wake up to hear of more horrific road accidents, often involving multiple deaths and, more often, involving young people, and also very serious injuries that completely destroy their quality of life. For all of this carnage, the Government must stand indicted for its failure to grasp the fact that car ownership and car usage is growing, that the average age of drivers is younger than it was, that the number of heavy goods vehicles on the roads has increased dramatically and that, apart from using their cars more often, people are also spending longer in their cars as commuting distances grow, that road conditions have changed dramatically in recent years, and that cars are infinitely more powerful and, consequently, potentially more lethal than they were.</P>
    <P>Against this background of change and totally altered road conditions, the Government still operates, more or less, the same old systems of testing and training, monitoring, controlling, enforcing and penalising that operated in an Ireland that no longer exists and is now gone for ever. This inertia, this failure to come to terms with the realities of the modern Ireland has had catastrophic and devastating consequences, last year for 415 families, and already this year, in a mere seven weeks, for 55 families. If that number of people died each year, or in any one year, as a result of any other sort of preventable accident, such as a fire or the collapse of a building, or a plane or boat disaster, all the resources of the State would be marshalled into action to prevent a recurrence. There would be an immediate public inquiry. Someone would be held accountable. We would have emergency legislation, major investment, improved regulation, rigorous monitoring. In short, anything that could be done would be done.</P>
    <P>Why then, are road deaths treated so differently? Why are they somehow more acceptable than other kinds of disaster? There is really only one difference. It is that road accidents are dispersed, and the families destroyed by those accidents are not a cohesive group. The individual families quietly bury their dead, and take home their injured and care for them in private. We, <Col N="1248" /> the public, quickly forget the images of the heartbreaking funerals and the mangled cars.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot and should not forget them. One would have to wonder at the alacrity with which the Government responded when faced with the BSE crisis, when almost overnight the determination and the billions of pounds could be found to deal with an economic crisis, one which had not caused the loss of one single human Irish life, and wonder why that same determination and single-minded sense of purpose is not applied to a problem where, every single day, lives are lost. Is there not something wrong with a Government which gives greater priority to the support of income than it does to the preservation of life?</P>
    <P>I accept that the Government recognised its responsibilities when it adopted a comprehensive five year road safety strategy. It was a strategic approach with specific targets focused on the key areas relating to alcohol, speeding and seat-belt wearing. It was a very modest strategy to reduce road deaths from the 1997 level by 20% by 2002. Modest as it was, it is not being met, and has no hope of being met at this rate. If the current trend continues for this year, it seems we will have a 20% increase rather than a decrease. Neither have any of the supporting targets any prospect of being met. They are, reducing the incidence of excess speeding, reducing the number of night-time drink-related accidents by 25%, or increasing compliance with seat-belt wearing to 85%.</P>
    <P>They are not particularly ambitious targets for any Government to set. The point is they were set. The Government has a strategy. However, there is no point in having a strategy if the Government does not create the conditions which are necessary to achieve the targets of the strategy. It has not made the legislative changes or created any of the conditions which the strategy saw as fundamental to the achievement of its targets, despite the fact that there have been repeated commitments to these targets, including by the Taoiseach as well as other members of the Government.</P>
    <P>In 90% of accidents, human behaviour is the major contributory factor. It is not the power of the car or the road conditions, important as they are. The single most important factor is human behaviour. Therefore, changing human behaviour has been rightly identified as being fundamental in reducing road accidents. There are two major ways in which Government can change behaviour, through education and training and through legislative changes which set standards of acceptable behaviour to which we are all expected to conform in the common interest and which then enforces that law and which penalises those who breach the standards.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the issue of education because my colleague, Deputy Naughten, will speak more extensively on this issue. With Deputy Coveney, he has done considerable research into this issue and the related problem of insurance costs for young people. They have produced a document which it would be well <Col N="1249" /> worth the Minister's while to look at. One thing about testing and training is that our testing regime is in chaos, and our driver training and education is almost non-existent. As many as 25% of all drivers are operating on provisional licences. There is no mandatory registration, no mandatory standards or training of instructors who play a vital and key role in imparting skills to new drivers. In any event, there is neither requirement or incentive to have a lesson before taking a car on the road. New and usually young drivers can be on the road for up to four years before they must apply for a test. That means they can be on the road for that length of time without ever even learning the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>Despite specific Government promises, neither investment or thought has been given to the critical early habit forming years when skills, attitudes and habits towards driving and road usage are developed. The motor car, properly used, has given people great freedom and much improved mobility. However, if it is misused it is a lethal weapon with the potential to kill or permanently maim. A person in his right mind would not consider giving a 17 year old a primed bomb or a gun without giving him the most intensive training in using such weapons and an awareness of the damage they can cause to themselves and others. Yet we legally hand over, in many cases to 17 year olds, powerful motor cars which have the same lethal potential. The only training in road usage given to our children takes place in primary schools where they learn to cross the road as pedestrians. Conscientious and responsible parents protect their children but the point is that there is no legal requirement to do so.</P>
    <P>Preparation is critical in the early years of learning to drive, but it does not end there. The strategy promised an education campaign throughout the driving years because, as in every other endeavour, we need to update our education to cope with changes. Many of us learned to drive and completed our driving tests in conditions which were utterly different to those which now pertain. When I learned to drive, for example, there were no roundabouts, motorways, bus lanes or dual carriageways. There were certainly no cycle paths.</P>
    <P>There is no ongoing training and education despite the Government's promises. There is not even a programme which involves television or some form of media campaign. In recent years, more than 200 kilometres of cycle paths have been constructed in the Dublin area but neither cyclists, motorists nor pedestrians have the slightest idea of how they operate and who has priority at junctions, roundabouts or in any other situation. It is inevitable in such circumstances that accidents will occur.</P>
    <P>As the number of cars on the roads grows each week, it becomes more critical that road users are operating and interacting with each other to some commonly held set of rules and assumptions about how others will behave. Anything else produces chaos. However, this is not happening due to the lack of ongoing education. People do <Col N="1250" /> not all assume that roundabouts or motorways operate in the same way and accidents are the result.</P>
    <P>Road users' behaviour can be changed by the implementation of legislation and regulations to set standards of driving and road use, to monitor the observance of these standards and to penalise non-observance. Legislation changes behaviour. It sets the standard that society views as acceptable and reflects the values of a society. There is already a considerable body of legislation relating to issues arising from road use &ndash; speeding, alcohol and seat belt use &ndash; but the Government's strategy recognises the inadequacy of this legislation because it is simply not enforced. Even when it is, the penalties are not sufficiently onerous to be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>A £55 speeding fine for the owner of an expensive powerful car is not a deterrent, yet it is known that the impact speed of an 80 kilometre per hour accident is 20 times more likely to result in death than an accident that occurs at 30 kilometres per hour. The only occasions on which penalties are onerous are in the court cases which follow accidents, when it is already too late and in most instances lives have been lost and human suffering caused.</P>
    <P>Three and a half years ago the Government promised to introduce a road traffic Bill providing for a penalty points system which would not only hit repeat offenders where it hurts but would ensure enforcement. It would operate automatically without resorting to the courts. Three and a half years later, with 55 people dead on the roads in the seven weeks of this year, there is still no sign of the legislation. Even if it were to come before the House now, there has been so little preparatory work on the technology required that it would take another two years to implement it.</P>
    <P>Some technology is available to assist enforcement, for example, speed cameras. However, there are only two speed detection cameras operating. I am aware this is only a pilot scheme but, apparently, the cameras are so efficient at detecting people speeding on the roads that the Garda cannot contemplate the introduction of the rest of the cameras because the automation required to process the fines is not available. That is the irony of the situation. We are not criticising the strategy; we support it. However, we criticise the failure of the Government to make the resources available or to demonstrate the will to achieve its targets.</P>

      <P>This issue is dear to the heart of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, who has raised it in the House on a number of occasions. I am disappointed that the Minister with responsibility for this issue, Deputy Molloy, is not present for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 February at Slane bridge, young David Garvey's short life was ended when a lorry loaded with timber crushed his body. He was the innocent party in a fatal road traffic accident. His death touched the general public and again high<Col N="1251" /> lighted the futility of our road safety policy. While David has now become nothing more than a statistic to those other than his family and friends, we should not allow his death to be in vain.</P>
    <P>Every day another family hears the doorbell ring to be told that their son or daughter, brother or sister, wife or husband, father or mother has been killed in a road traffic accident. These people have now become road accident statistics but to the families involved the person is some-one they loved, a person who has been taken from them in a split second, never to return. A life has been lost and another person forms the litany of shame because of the lack of political will to address this issue. How long more are we prepared to allow the slaughter on our roads to continue, while we fail to take action?</P>
    <P>Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Numerous Governments have ignored this issue. To the credit of this Government, it was the first to publish a road safety strategy but, sadly, it has failed dismally to implement it. If fully implemented, the strategy could save more than 200 lives every year. The Government has been big on soundbites but impotent on action. More than 1,400 people have died on our roads since this Government took office. Its road safety policy is in a shambles, a view which has been endorsed by the National Safety Council and the Irish Insurance Federation. The insurance industry has even gone so far as to threaten to withdraw its £1 million funding of road safety initiatives due to the Government's incompetence.</P>
    <P>Every 14 minutes there is a road traffic accident to which the Garda are called. One in three of these involves an injury which requires hospitalisation. The Government, however, in its usual snail's pace approach to implementing road safety measures, has yet to decide, nearly three years after the publication of its road safety proposals, whether to implement many of the measures. While the Government is not to blame for road deaths that are caused by people's consumption of alcohol or drugs or by their reckless behaviour behind the wheel, it is guilty of failing to deliver on its own plan which would have a direct impact on road deaths and the spiralling cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>People's lives are being placed at risk as a consequence of political failure. Accidents with tragic consequences will continue to happen while the Government fails to make road safety a priority. Each year the road accident figures equate with one 747 airplane crashing and killing all on board and four 747s crashing and seriously injuring all passengers. If this happened each year within the airline industry, there would be a huge outcry, yet we continue to ignore a similar situation on our roads.</P>
    <P>Road users in Ireland are twice as likely to be killed on the roads as citizens in the UK. The Taoiseach has told the House on more occasions than I care to remember that the Road Traffic Bill will be published &ldquo;before the end of the session&rdquo;. Many <Col N="1252" /> sessions have come and gone, yet there is no sign of this legislation. The current delays and lack of political commitment will see a further 1,000 people die on our roads before the implementation of the new penalty points system, a system which is in place in every other EU country.</P>
    <P>Driver error is the major factor in 80% of accidents. Young drivers, mainly young males, cause four out of ten accidents, many of which are fatal. Young drivers are more likely to underestimate the consequences of speeding and dangerous driving. Their accidents typically involve driving too fast for the prevailing conditions. In the majority of cases speed is the single biggest contributory factor, combined with inexperience. About 100 young drivers will be killed by the end of this year by crashing into a pole or a wall with no other vehicle involved.</P>
    <P>However, it is facile to suggest that the lethal combination of testosterone and money is the main reason so many young male drivers kill themselves and others on our roads when it is clear that bad training and non-existent testing are also playing a major role in road carnage. Young male drivers continue to be virtually the sole focus of public odium and debate while factors within the Government's competence to tackle, by way of a radical policy response, are ignored. Such a debate misses the point that if a quarter of the driving population on the roads is untrained and untested, or has failed a test, there will inevitably be very serious consequences for some of those drivers and for other road users.</P>
    <P>At the current rate, 1,000 of this year's leaving certificate students will be killed on our roads in the next eight years and nearly half, 29,000, will be injured during the same period, the majority requiring hospitalisation. Because of these factors, young drivers are used as scapegoats for the bad habits and dangerous driving of other road users. Until we address this issue we will fail to comprehensively deal with the problem of road carnage. The Government's road safety strategy all but ignores this factor.</P>
    <P>One out of every four drivers has a provisional licence. A car is a lethal weapon if not used with due care yet one can pay £12 for a provisional licence, get into a car with no training and put the public at risk. Nobody cares about this. Are we giving out licences to drive or to kill?</P>
    <P>Every month the State finds that more than 1,000 people are unsuitable to drive as they fail their driving test. However, not only does the Government allow them back on the road, it does not even tell them what they are doing wrong. If a plane crashed killing all on board and it was found that the pilot had failed his pilot's course, there would be public outcry. However, every month we let 1,000 people who have failed the test back on our roads without even telling them why they failed.</P>
    <P>How can we stand over the 45% failure rate in the driving test? If this was happening in the leaving certificate the Minister would have to resign. Would we allow our children to sit the exam with out being taught or if they were taught by <Col N="1253" /> unqualified teachers? We allow something similar with a lethal weapon.</P>
    <P>There are no structures in place for driver training. The majority of provisional drivers drive for four years without any training or knowledge of the rules of the road. In some cases, people drive on provisional licences for ten to 12 years. This situation is compounded by the fact that any cowboy can establish a driving school and impart his poor driving skills to a further generation. Many have not even sat the test. Surely this cannot be tolerated any longer. Ireland has the highest road fatality rate in Europe. We are the only member of the EU without any driver training programme or penalty points system.</P>
    <P>If the average speed on our roads was reduced by 5 mph this could save up to 50 lives. If people used dipped lights during daylight hours 20 lives could be saved and 650 fewer people would be injured, and if we introduced a penalty points system 200 lives could be saved and 6,500 injuries avoided. Had the Government implemented its strategy it would have made a serious impact on these statistics.</P>
    <P>The Garda has been hampered by the derisory funding with which it is provided to enforce the road traffic legislation. The current £50 fine is seen as a paltry figure and is prohibitive to few. It is not unusual for a driver to pick up a number of such fines in the course of one day. In many cases their employers pick up the bill. What type of enforcement is this?</P>
    <P>It has been conclusively proven that enforcement works. The state of Victoria in Australia is a shining example of such measures, as has been Operation Lifesaver in the Louth-Meath area which has reduced the number of accidents by 20%. Nationally this would equate to 80 lives per annum. We cannot allow individuals who repeatedly violate traffic legislation to get away scot free.</P>
    <P>While alcohol and speed are the major factors in accidents, fatigue is responsible for more than 40 deaths per year. Measures must also address this growing problem. However, road safety is not only about the lives of those involved. It is not only about the mother who waits up on a Saturday night waiting for her son or daughter to arrive home safely hoping that she will not hear the doorbell ring and the news it could bring. It also has a dramatic effect on the cost of insurance, particularly for young drivers. The insurance industry has indicated that it intends to hike up the cost by 20% this year. The financial cost of road accidents is £600 million per annum and the driving population has to pick up the tab. If the Government is unmoved by the carnage surely its economic whiz kids can point out that it makes sense to tackle this growing issue, if only on an economic level. I, and a number of Members, have heard the doorbell ring and know of the sudden numbness when one tries to come to terms with what one has just been told. It is time to stop that doorbell ringing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to last weekend, 53 people had been involved in fatal road accidents this year. That is more than one every day. Last year more than 400 people died tragically on our roads. Twice as many people <i>per capita </i>die on roads in Ireland than in the UK. We have a massive problem to which the Government needs to respond. However, it has not been performing.</P>
      <P>Three and a half years ago the Government promised a road traffic Bill. Sixteen weeks ago the Taoiseach again promised that the Bill would come before the House in the last session but this did not happen. We have again been promised that we will shortly see the road traffic Bill. One could be forgiven for being sceptical.</P>
      <P>The Government's road safety strategy has been referred to by previous speakers. Much of the strategy's content is excellent and makes a great deal of sense regarding the enforcement of regulations controlling alcohol, speeding and the wearing of seat belts Fine Gael agrees with the vast majority of the strategy's recommendations. However, many of the recommendations have not been introduced.</P>
      <P>There is no excuse for the Government's failure to introduce a penalty points system. The alcohol limit in Ireland is among the four highest in Europe. Ten European countries have lower limits on alcohol consumption. On speeding, there are only two fixed working speed cameras in the country. If that is not an example of a lack of commitment to reduce speed, I do not know what is.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is taking this issue seriously. We have done more than just criticise the Government for its inaction. Senator Naughten and I have put together a good strategy document entitled, It's Time to Stop the Road Carnage, which I hope the Minister will seriously consider. It outlines many of the enforcement priorities in the Government's road safety strategy. It also deals with the issue of training for young people, which has not been dealt with by the Government. This is the only country in Europe which allows 17 year olds to buy a provisional licence and drive for up to five years before they are trained and tested. As a result, many young men, in particular, are injured or killed in accidents which could have been avoided if they had been trained and shown responsibility behind the wheel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy document also highlights the need for the introduction of a road safety course in transition year in schools. This has been done in County Donegal on a pilot basis and has been successful. We want to ensure that before a young person is given a provisional licence he or she must do a written or practical assessment on the rules of the road to ensure they understand them. We also want to introduce a 25 hour training course for those with provisional licences waiting to take a driving test. The structure for this course is in place. It has been approved by the Irish Insurance Federation which has stated that it will reduce insurance premia for those who <Col N="1255" /> do the course. In doing so it is indicating that it has confidence that it will reduce the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>There are two main aims in our policy document which the Government should consider, one of which is to make our roads safer and the other to try to reduce the cost of insurance, particularly for young men. If one is aged between 17 and 25 years, one will have to pay between £3,000 and £4,000 for third party insurance cover on a relatively small car. Unfortunately, for many a car is a necessity, not a luxury. We are not playing politics with this issue. I appeal to the Minister to look at our document and take the cost effective and practical measures on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for allowing me to make a brief contribution to what is an important debate. If we succeed in highlighting the cause of death on our roads, we will have succeeded. I am not sure we will, however, given the Government's amendment which states that Dáil Éireann &ldquo;endorses the Government strategy&rdquo;. I am appalled by that. What strategy is the Government talking about? This is a serious issue. Young people are losing their lives in every county. The amendment also states that Dáil Éireann &ldquo;notes the priority given by the strategy to actions to address speed&rdquo;. What actions is the Government taking? Speed is the root cause of the problem. Attempts are not being made, however, to deal with those who are speeding recklessly. Deputy Coveney mentioned speed cameras and the fact that only two are in operation. The system is outrageous. It is common knowledge that there are camera boxes in place with no cameras in them. The two cameras in operation are moved from one place to another and may not even work. This encourages speed and recklessness. Young people and others will take chances. It is time we took this issue seriously.</P>
      <P>We all have a part to play in stopping the carnage on our roads. I would have expected the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to accept this motion in the good faith in which it was tabled. The Government needs to do something concrete. The side lights on a car should come on automatically day and night when the ignition key is turned. That is a simple safety measure which should be introduced. Seat belts save lives. Bleepers should be installed in cars and go off when people do not put on their seat belts in the same way as they go off when one leaves the key in the ignition or the lights turned on. Fog lights should be abolished. People leave their fog lights on when it is not necessary and this burns the eyes of motorists following them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speed cameras should be in place. If we reduce the number of people speeding, we can deal with this problem. The only way to reduce speeding is to put speed traps and cameras in place. When people are caught, they should be hit in their <Col N="1256" /> pockets where it hurts. The carnage must stop. We all know families which have lost loved ones. Many of them were innocent bystanders going about their business and driving safely on the road who were mown down by an oncoming car or someone passing recklessly. That is not tolerable. This is happening to our best young people.</P>
    <P>People should receive proper driving instruction and a full driving licence before they are allowed to drive on their own. That is not happening, however. I understand a young person with a job must have a provisional licence to get from their home to their place of work. The waiting time for driving tests is intolerable. One could wait months. That is not good enough. The economy is rapidly progressing and our young people must be able to get to work.</P>
    <P>The Government may say it is easy for the Opposition to point the finger, but it has the responsibility and the power to introduce legislation to deal with this problem. If it does this, the people will support it. We support it by tabling this motion. It is unacceptable that the Government has tabled an amendment claiming what it has done rather than acknowledging what it has not done. This is a serious issue. People are annoyed and frustrated about it. If the Government is not prepared to deal with this issue, it should allow someone else to do so.</P>

      <P>Better driving skills and driving behaviour would make an enormous difference to reducing the number of road accident casualties.</P>
      <P>Driving is an acquired and demanding skill. As well as the right skills, drivers need the right attitude towards speed, other road users, alcohol, drugs and fatigue, which is a factor in the large number of tragedies. We need to make learning to drive more relevant in today's terms. Some 4,920 people have lost their lives on our roads. The main contributory factors to death and injury from road accidents are excessive speed, the non-wearing of seat belts and drink driving. Drivers were identified as the cause of accidents in 70% of cases. One person is killed every 19 hours and one person is injured every 40 minutes on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to introduce driver education at second level. A theory test for the provisional licence must also be introduced. The waiting time for driving tests must be reduced. People could wait up to eight or nine months for a driving test. This should be reduced to a maximum of two months. We must also reform the outdated driving test and introduce a penalty points system, which is important. Deputy Naughten put a lot of work into this area. Figures published this week show that our young people have the highest rate of alcohol abuse in Europe. We have twice the level of tragedies <i>per capita </i>compared to Britain. The figures are quite significant. When one person is killed on our roads every 19 hours it is time to say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. Millions of pounds are being spent on the development of motorways but cameras should be built into such developments in an <Col N="1257" /> effort to control speeding. People are driving high-powered cars that are beyond their capacity to control and, unfortunately, most of the victims are young people. Nothing is worse than a knock on the door to inform a family of the death of a loved one in a road accident. Such families must suffer for years from the resulting trauma.</P>
    <P>The car industry is a major economic component but we must implement controls to ensure that drivers are properly trained. Free driving lessons should be promoted along with the introduction of a novice driver's log book. This could include a staged learning process, elements of which would include: driver education at second level, a provisional licence theory test, a structured driving course and hazard perception training. All those elements must be introduced. Better driving skills and improved behaviour would make an enormous difference towards reducing road casualties.</P>
    <P>Driving is an acquired skill and a demanding one. As well as having the correct skills, drivers need to have the right attitude towards speed which is a killer. The number of cars on the road has risen five times in recent years.</P>
    <P>Learning to drive must be made more relevant to today's road conditions, but this is not being done. Road conditions have changed completely with the introduction of motorways. We have a booming economy and young people are driving new cars without realising the dangers involved. Motorways were originally introduced to eliminate tragedies on the road, but the number of accidents has risen since major new roadways were introduced. There is now a pilot scheme to park crashed vehicles on the roadside to remind people of the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>This debate is a very important one. We need action from the Government to take into account two or three major recommendations to curb road accidents. The Garda Síochána does outstanding work but a dedicated Garda task force should be introduced to deal exclusively with road checks to ensure there is not any abuse of the law by drivers. If people are caught speeding on camera and have to pay a £50 fine it will be a blessing in disguise for them and a solid investment in road safety.</P>
    <P>I appeal to parents to instruct their children to obtain proper driving instruction. Before handing over the keys of their cars, parents should be satisfied that their children will treat road safety as the paramount objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>endorses the Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 as the first ever national road safety strategy adopted by an Irish Government;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>notes the priority given by the strategy to <Col N="1258" /> actions to address speed, drink driving and seat-belt wearing; recognises the considerable progress which has already been made in relation to policies and measures promised by the strategy and that the interim targets of the strategy have been achieved;</P>
    <P>notes and commends the commitment of all road safety agencies to intensify actions in the areas of enforcement, engineering, legislation and public awareness under the co-ordination of the strategy;</P>
    <P>and calls upon these agencies to continue their efforts so that remaining policies and measures are delivered and the five year targets of the strategy are fully achieved.</P>
    <P>Road safety is now the focus of greatly increased public, media and political concern. The Government welcomes this development and has been pro-active in encouraging it. The present Government is the first ever to have adopted a national road safety strategy. That strategy is an ambitious and hard-edged one which has set demanding and quantified targets for achievement within its five-year period. In sponsoring its road safety strategy, the Government has therefore deliberately made itself more accountable than before for progress on road safety activities. We accept that accountability and we will answer for it.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as an acceptable level of death or injury from road accidents, but to establish a momentum for improving road safety the Government strategy has fixed reduction targets for achievement by the end of 2002. Good progress is being made towards these and in delivering policies and measures promised under the strategy.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in road safety have taken place over the past 20 years. The annual road death toll had reached into the 600s during the 1970s, whereas for the past decade it has stood in the 400s. This significant improvement follows a trend in most developed countries and has been achieved in the face of increasing traffic volumes and road travel. A range of factors has been involved in delivering it, among others: more precautionary regulations in relation to seat belts, speed limits and other key factors designed to influence road user behaviour; better enforcement; road engineering; public awareness and improved safety design in road vehicles.</P>
    <P>In late 1997, the high level group on road safety was mandated to prepare a national strategy for road safety. This group is chaired by my Department and consists of representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, and the Irish Insurance Federation. Such national strategies have been developed by all the countries recognised as leaders in the field of road safety. Road safety strategies have also been adopted for the European Union and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> A strategic approach by the Government to road safety seemed desirable in order to align ourselves with best international practice, to support the EU road safety programme and to improve synergies and co-operation between road safety activities here and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This was the first national road safety strategy to be adopted by an Irish Government. It specified demanding and quantified targets in relation to road safety, and the Government and road safety agencies now hold themselves accountable in relation to their targets.</P>
    <P>The strategy tries to provide a better focus and definition of the progress we now need to make in the area of road safety. The strategy is intended to rally greater public and political support for road safety, and to spur and co-ordinate the efforts of the different road safety agencies.</P>
    <P>The strategy has a five-year term and sets as its primary target the reduction of road fatalities by a minimum of 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. A similar minimum reduction is targeted for serious injuries from road accidents. We estimate that this primary target should save at least 172 lives annually from the year 2002 compared to continuing on the present basis.</P>
    <P>Supporting targets of the strategy are: to reduce the incidence of excess speeding by at least 50% from present levels; to increase the wearing rate for front and rear seat belts to at least 85%; to reduce by 25% the number of fatal road accidents, which are commonly drink related, occurring during the hours of darkness;</P>
    <P>and to implement specific accident reduction measures at more than 400 additional national road locations. These targets are to be achieved both by the application of certain new policies and actions, and by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures.</P>
    <P>International experience shows that reductions in road accidents can be most quickly achieved by targeting human behaviour, in particular, the three key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing. The challenge we face can be realised from the fact that half the drivers of Irish cars and heavy goods vehicles drive in breach of the principal speed limits. Our rate of seat belt wearing is well behind international best practice. Despite a welcome change in social attitudes, alcohol is still a major factor in road accidents. It is logical that the strategy should prioritise three areas calculated to deliver 72% of the total life-savings we are targeting. In its second progress report, the high level group determined that while the basic prioritisation established in the original strategy remains valid, a special focus should be given to highlight vulnerable road users. This focus has been determined as the fourth key action area for the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>We are at the mid-point of implementing the Government strategy for road safety, 1998-2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy have been fully met. These were by end 2000 to reduce <Col N="1260" /> Ireland's rate of road fatalities per one million inhabitants to a figure not exceeding 116 and to complete specific accident reduction measures at 240 locations on the national road network. By end 1999, Ireland's road fatality rate per one million inhabitants stood at 112 and by end 2000, 268 accident reduction schemes were completed and a further 88 have been approved.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the Government strategy we have been making real and worthwhile gains in road safety: road deaths decreased by 59 or nearly 13% between 1997 and 1999 relative to the strategy target of a 20% minimum reduction by end 2002. Serious injuries decreased in the same period by more than 15% relative to a similar reduction target, 20%, by end 2002. A slight increase in road deaths, from 413 to 415, was recorded in 2000. A range of existing and new measures were deployed to support these road safety improvements.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. More than 224,000 on-the-spot fines were issued in relation to speeding offences in 2000 compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on-the-spot fines were issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. Evidential breath testing is being progressively introduced in relation to drink driving enforcement. Research preliminary findings of the two year MBRS drugs research programme funded by my Department were made available during May 2000. Of samples under the limit for alcohol, 37% were positive for drugs &ndash; mainly cannabis. This project, when completed, with wider international analysis and research in this area, will inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, enforcement practice and procedure and-or legislation.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority completed a national analysis of young driver accidents and is continuing this work through a more detailed study of some problematic counties. In September 2000 the National Safety Council launched an education resource pack on safety, including road safety, entitled, Be Safe, for use in primary schools under the social, personal and health education programme in the new primary school curriculum. More than 30,000 copies of the pack were distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management. The NSC is working on a package for secondary schools which it is hoped to launch this September.</P>
    <P>A new hard-hitting anti-drink driving television commercial was jointly developed by National Safety Council and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland which was aired over the Christmas period. The commercial was jointly <Col N="1261" /> launched by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in Belfast with his Northern counterpart. At a recent meeting of the NorthSouth Ministerial Council it was agreed that one such campaign could be envisaged each year. National media campaigns on television and radio continue to highlight the risks of speeding and non-wearing of seat belts.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a road factor contributes to 25% of all accidents. Engineering measures are, therefore, an appropriate response to these cases and an important element in the road safety strategy. My Department has published the Guide to Road Safety Engineering in Ireland which has been circulated to all road authorities and is used by the NRA. The main purpose of the guide is to explain how accidents can be reduced by introducing low cost road engineering measures. Training courses in the use of this manual and the treatment of high accident locations was developed by the NRA for local authorities.</P>
    <P>The NRA low cost remedial accident counter measure programme is showing huge success. A recent formal assessment of the impact in the first two years of this programme shows a reduction of six fatal accidents and nine serious injury accidents each year since the works were carried out, with a benefit cost ratio of nearly 6:1.</P>
    <P>A similar programme of low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads was introduced for the first time in 2000. Some 55 locations on non-national roads were approved for funding last year. The 2001 allocations provide £1.8 million for similar works this year in what will be a much more extensive programme.</P>
    <P>A commitment is given in the Government strategy for road safety to the introduction of a penalty points system to track infringements of driving regulations with a view to improving the driving behaviour of those who recurringly commit these breaches. Approval for the drafting of the Road Traffic Bill, 2000, was given by the Government on 26 July 2000. The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of the proposed penalty points system. It has been claimed lately that Ireland is the last country in Europe to introduce a system of penalty points, but that statement is not true. The only EU countries which operate a penalty points system are France, Germany, the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and Greece. We are ahead of most European countries in terms of introducing penalty points.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the strategy, the design of the system required careful consideration in Irish circumstances because of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice. This gave rise to protracted examination of the legal issues in consultation with Office of the Attorney General. There could have been no question of proceeding on any basis that entailed uncertainty. The drafting of the Bill by the parliamentary counsel is proceeding as a matter of urgency with a view to its publication shortly. In addition to the passing of the relevant legislation, a number of other initiatives must be <Col N="1262" /> taken to facilitate the introduction and administration of a penalty points system. Section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which will require full driving licence holders to carry their licences while driving, must be commenced.</P>
    <P>The administration of the system will also need to be supported by the proposed computerised national driver file, NDF, being developed. In prospect of this becoming available, a project team has been established, involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, to develop a business specification for penalty points as an add-on to the NDF which will be in place by end 2001.</P>
    <P>On the driver testing service, I am grateful for the opportunity to explain to the House the progress that has been made in improving the delivery of the driving test service in the face of a continuing and unprecedented high level of demand for the service. The current waiting time problem started in 1996 when greatly increased numbers of driving test applications were made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, partly at least in response to tighter regulations about the renewal of provisional driving licences. In 1996 applications rose by 20% over 1995. In 1997, however, the rate of increase in test applications abated considerably.</P>

      <P>The attack by US and British aircraft on Iraqi military installations must be condemned out of hand. Aircraft from the central command regions carried out the mission which the Pentagon described as a self-defence one against command and control centres which have contributed to increased harrying of coalition air patrols in the no-fly zone. The Pentagon has also said that an escalation in the threat to allied planes left them with no choice. It is no surprise that the UK defence Minister, Mr. Geoff Hoone, has also supported the attack. He said that the allies were perfectly entitled to defend themselves under international law, and were entitled to attack the Iraqis when they threaten aircraft, as they have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1990, Iraq has suffered under sanctions imposed. A number of Members of the House have visited Iraq to see at first hand the destruction and loss of life caused to innocent civilians. They have outlined the human suffering that the sanctions have caused. Iraq has demanded an end to the sanctions, a request which has been supported by the Arab nations, France, Russia, China and other countries. It seems inappropriate that the US and British Governments would decide to attack at a time when many nations are seeking changes in the sanctions and huge efforts <Col N="1263" /> are being made to allow UN inspectors to return to Iraq. It is important that the Government condemns this wrong attack. In the past ten years, we have witnessed a campaign of bombings and sanctions against Iraq which has failed miserably. It has only served to make Saddam Hussein a greater hero and inflict dreadful hardship on innocent Iraqi people, and cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The US and British authorities cannot be allowed to be the self-appointed guardians of the world. Britain is our near neighbour. While I appreciate the major changes that have taken place between our countries in the recent years, the wonderful relationship that has existed between the USA and Ireland for many years, and the vital role played by the US in bringing peace to this country, we cannot allow these facts to prevent us from doing what is right and necessary in this situation. We are in a very privileged position as a member of the UN Security Council, and it is important that we play a prominent role in bringing about humanitarian aid and an initiative to deal with the Iraqi acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds of human aid is being held up by the 661 committee, and it is vital that it is released immediately. The oil for food programme has not worked as it should, as there is an obvious lack of willingness to implement it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will participate in important meetings in Moscow, Paris and Washington in the coming days. He should use the opportunity to highlight that the use of force can no longer be tolerated, the sanctions must be lifted, and a peaceful policy be pursued in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>US and British aircraft attacked Iraqi air defence installations last Friday evening. These attacks were in response to a build-up of those defences which was perceived by the American and British authorities as threatening to the safety of their aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq. These actions have taken place at a time when efforts are being made to secure the return of a UN disarmament mission to Iraq and a possible review of sanctions. The Government regrets very much that the use of force was deemed necessary. We hope every step will be taken to avoid further use of force which might lead to civilian casualties and impede efforts, ten years after the end of the Gulf War, to restore normal life for the Iraqi people and Iraq's return to the international community. We are also concerned that the legal basis in UN resolutions for these air-strikes is a matter of dispute between members of the Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next week the Minister for Foreign Affairs will hold high level talks with the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Védrine and with the new US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and the National Security Adviser, Condoleeza Rice. These talks, which will include bilateral issues, <Col N="1264" /> will also cover Security Council issues of common interest. Clearly, the continuing UN sanctions against Iraq, and particularly their impact on the people in Iraq, will be an important part of these talks. The Minister will outline the view of the Government that last Friday's events need to be seen in the broader context of widespread inter-national concern about the situation in Iraq and the implementation of Security Council resolutions. All issues outstanding in relation to the implementation of UN sanctions against Iraq need to be addressed before those specific problems which gave rise to the military strikes last Friday can be resolved.</P>
    <P>These include the humanitarian aspects and the need for Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions, especially those relating to Iraq's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. I recall that it was also international concern with an earlier humanitarian situation in Iraq, and grave abuse of human rights there, which gave rise to a number of decisions taken by the Security Council some ten years ago. Ireland wishes to see sanctions lifted at the earliest possible moment. However, to help bring this about, Iraq must demonstrate with concrete evidence its peaceful intentions, especially with regard to its neighbours.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian problem being faced by the people of Iraq is of major concern to the Government and we are taking every opportunity at the United Nations and elsewhere to hold discussions on this complex issue with the various parties, including other Security Council members and key United Nations personnel. In these discussions we have stressed the urgent need to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially children, and to greatly improve the conditions of the general population who are directly affected by the implementation of the UN sanctions. We will address these issues again in discussions scheduled to take place in the Security Council later today.</P>
    <P>Our approach to this issue, as a member of the Security Council, is informed both by the need to address the human suffering and to ensure that Iraq complies with the decisions of the Security Council. All countries are required under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council and Ireland stands by this obligation. The Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with UN Commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction is the basis for the continued imposition of the sanctions. The ten years since the Gulf War is too long a period for the stand-off to persist at such a dreadful human cost.</P>
    <P>We would welcome an urgent examination of the sanctions programme, particularly in regard to the problems caused by holds and delays in implementing the oil for food programme and the manner in which the Iraqi authorities use oil for food funds. Areas in which progress is urgently needed also include the deployment of the new UN disarmament mission (UNMOVIC). We see <Col N="1265" /> the planned meeting later this month between the UN Secretary General and the Iraqi Foreign Minister as providing the opportunity to identify the steps to be taken by Iraq so that progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Progress will only be made when the spirit of co-operation replaces that of confrontation and we would appeal to all to avoid provocative actions and statements which would serve to undermine the prospects for such progress. Security Council Resolution 1234 provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with the new disarmament supervisory commission and compliance with the conditions imposed by the Security Council. We wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow concrete progress to be made on the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of the sanctions. This would be a major step towards the return of Iraq to its rightful place in the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government has also directly addressed the humanitarian issues. A grant of £100,000 by Ireland Aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross was made last November to address the rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation facilities in Iraq.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>The train incident at Kiltoom, County Roscommon, could have been a holocaust. Four school buses use this level crossing from Monday to Friday. Dozens of cars, lorries, tractors, cyclists and pedestrians use it daily. There was no loss of life because the incident occurred in the early hours of the morning. There are 23 level crossings on the railway line between Ballina and Athlone. There have been five almost identical incidents at this level crossing. On 22 December 2000, another freight train smashed through its gates. After eight weeks we do not know the circumstances surrounding that incident. Last Friday, a representative of Iarnród Éireann stated in the media that it was conducting a formal investigation into the December incident which was almost completed. This is not the situation because there is not a formal inquiry. Only disciplinary proceedings against the driver concerned were instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should always be a formal inquiry into incidents like this. It is not automatic but it is normal in Iarnród Éireann. It is usually conducted by company managers to establish the cause of the accident. Following this, management can determine if the mechanical signalling system or human error was responsible. Will the Minister of State explain why a proper formal inquiry was not undertaken? Why is there no report from the incident on 22 December? There is no compli<Col N="1266" /> cated technology involved. There is a gate which is supposed to open as a train approaches and close when it has passed. We must establish why the gates closed against the train on 22 December 2000 and last Friday. Was it mechanical failure? If so, why? If it was human error, who was responsible?</P>
    <P>In a case involving human safety, a report should be completed within a week, so that the cause can be established, lessons learned, and corrective measures taken. Instead of a report of the incident eight weeks ago we have a similar occurrence at the same location. The report on last Friday's incident should be available now. I have raised the issue of rail safety each week since the Dáil reconvened. I am critical of the Government's tardiness in bringing forward the rail safety Bill which extends the powers of the railway inspectorate. It will not be published until the middle of the year nor be law before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Last week, I raised the concerns of the railway safety inspectorate that Iarnród Éireann do not supply vital information. The mini CTC system, which is supposed to equip 28 stations and four main lines with modern safety signalling, is at a standstill because of the handling of the contract and the rise in cost to £42 million. The problem of rail safety must be addressed before a major tragedy occurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The rail incident at Kiltoom, where a freight train destroyed the level crossing gates last Friday, is of concern to all people residing close to these crossings. At least eight similar incidents have occurred at this level crossing which is used by 200 cars and two school buses every day and other vehicles including the army travelling to and from the Carnagh rifle range. The Friday incident is a repeat of one on 22 December 2000. Contrary to media reports, Irish Rail did not instigate a formal inquiry. My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, has raised already the questions about this. Such an inquiry should take place and the conclusions published for both incidents.</P>
      <P>The people of Kiltoom deserve this at least, as do others who reside alongside similar crossings.</P>
      <P>The line between Athlone and Ballina is one of the most dilapidated. Irish Rail is upgrading the line but not the level crossings, many of which are 100 years old. There have been twice as many incidents at this level crossing as at all similar crossings on this line. The drivers who travel this line daily are more prone to accidents at this crossing. This raises serious questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distance between the gates and the signals has not changed in more than 100 years. The track has been upgraded and trains' speeds increased. A paraffin oil lamp as the warning signal is not acceptable today. Since last Friday a 25 mph sign was erected at this crossing. This should have been done before the last incident or the one before. The Minister should respond to the <Col N="1267" /> fact that following a similar incident in 1996 it was recommended that the distance between the signal and the gate be increased. Irish Rail say this crossing is not a priority for upgrading but there have been a litany of accidents there. The semaphore signals are outdated and ought to be replaced by the colour signals which should be at all level crossings. The Minister should ensure that Irish Rail does this immediately.</P>
    <P>I also hope the Minister will bring forward the legislation as quickly as possible. The Minister said that Irish Rail had not furnished information sought by the rail inspector. This means that Irish Rail is not answerable to the House. This is unacceptable. There are serious question marks over the handling of this and previous incidents by Irish Rail. There is huge concern locally about the level crossing because Irish Rail has ignored the safety issues involved on numerous occasions. I hope the crossing will be upgraded. Must we wait for a tragedy similar to the one that happened at Slieve Corbally in Donamon when a young girl was killed crossing the railway line? Must we wait for a similar occurrence before the level crossing is upgraded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Higgins and Naughten for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>The level crossing at Kiltoom is a CX designated crossing with the level crossing gates normally closed across the railway. It is protected on either side by semaphore signals. At approximately 5.15 a.m. on Friday, 16 February 2001, a freight train travelling from Ballina to North Wall in Dublin ran through and broke both gates at the level crossing. No injuries were sustained. Iarnród Éireann has commenced a formal internal inquiry into the matter and the Minister has asked the company for its speedy completion and a report on its conclusions as a matter of urgency. Pending completion of the inquiry, the Minister has also asked to be provided with an interim report setting out the causes of the incident as soon as these are ascertained.</P>
      <P>The chief railway inspecting officer visited the site of the incident and reported that he found the area around the level crossing to be in good condition with new track laid, good sighting of signals, good curvature of track and the vegetation cleared from the trackside. He has sought clarification from Iarnród Éireann on a number of issues, including details of the communication between the signalman at Knockrockery and the gatekeeper, the training details for the driver and gatekeeper, previous inspections of the level crossing by Iarnród Éireann and details of the braking distances required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too early to ascertain the cause or causes of the incident pending completion of the Iarnród Éireann internal inquiry. In the meantime, the company has put in place a speed restriction of 25 mph through Kiltoom level crossing. The normal permitted speed through the crossing was 70 mph <Col N="1268" /> for passenger trains and 50 mph for freight trains. Iarnród Éireann is also reviewing the operation of the level crossing with a view to the introduction of colour light signals and other remedial works.</P>
    <P>The previous incident to which the Deputies referred occurred on 22 December and involved a passenger train which collided with one of the gates at the level crossing. A formal inquiry was established in this instance also. Iarnród Éireann has advised that the immediate cause of the incident was a failure by the driver to stop short of the gate. The inquiry was investigating whether there were underlying causes of the incident, but this has been suspended pending completion of the inquiry into the latest incident. The Minister has been advised that the driver involved in the incident has been retrained and disciplinary action against him has been instigated.</P>
    <P>The railway inspectorate also requested additional information from Iarnród Éireann on this incident which is awaited. The information requested relates to the distances from the signals to the level crossing and the braking distance required at the crossing, taking into account the line speed, gradients and train type.</P>
    <P>The latest incident is the fifth to have occurred at Kiltoom level crossing since May 1994. While no injuries have been sustained in any of these incidents, the frequency of the incidents is nevertheless worrying. The Minister has, therefore, directed the railway inspecting officers to undertake an inquiry into the causes of the incident at Kiltoom level crossing on Friday last and into the previous incidents at the level crossing and to furnish her with a full report on these incidents. The Minister also proposes to introduce a new regulatory framework for railway safety. Earlier this month she published a consultation document, Proposals for New Railway Safety Legislation, copies of which she sent to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The consultation document is in the form of a general scheme of a proposed railway safety Bill. The principal features of the proposed Bill are the establishment of an independent railway safety authority with wide-ranging powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement. The proposed Bill will also introduce a &ldquo;safety case&rdquo; approach to railway safety and will place a duty on railway operators to operate a safe railway. It will also establish a railway safety advisory council to consider issues relevant to railway safety. The council will comprise representatives of the railway industry, railway unions, bodies representing the public interest, bodies representing employee or public safety and other experts in railway safety. The consultation period finishes on Friday, 2 March 2001, and the Minister would welcome comments on her proposals from Deputies and all other interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 2001.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works purchased a farm at Longstown, Sallins, County Kildare from the company in question. The property was purchased at auction on 29 September. The purchase price is £5.65 million. When account is taken of the value of the main residence, a gate lodge, another residential property and exclusive farmyards and farm buildings, the cost per acre is about £13,000. The land is required by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as a replacement for the farm at Abbotstown which is required for the development of Campus Stadium Ireland.</P>
      <P>The property was purchased because of its exceptional suitability for the Department's purposes. Its location within easy reach of Backweston where the Department's laboratory facilities are to be relocated was particularly suitable. The range of buildings and farmyards which the property offered were also a particularly close fit to the Department's brief.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works acted as agent for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and was specifically concerned with the quality and value of the property, and that title was in order. An independent agricultural consultant and valuer advised in relation to the quality and value of the property. The vendors had good title to it. Full details of the transaction were furnished by the Office of Public Works to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 30 November 2000 to a similar question from Deputy Michael Higgins.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate measures are in place to minimise the risk of Irish financial institutions being used for the purpose of money laundering, but if any of the authorities concerned considers that further measures are necessary, I will consider them.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Central Bank carried out on-site inspections of a number of credit institutions focusing on adherence to anti-money laundering procedures. The findings from these inspections are being reviewed by the Central Bank and appropriate follow-up action will be taken by the bank and, if necessary, by other authorities. There are also a number of ongoing initiatives in place to ensure anti-money laundering legislation, guidance notes and procedures in place in Ireland reflect best international practice.</P>

      <P>The rural renewal scheme was introduced in the 1998 Finance Act. The relief for rented residential property was introduced with effect from 1 June 1998 and the scheme was amended in the 1999 Finance Act to also include owner occupied residential property as qualifying premises. The business elements of the scheme were approved by the European Commission in June 1999 and introduced with effect from 1 July of that year. This delay in introducing the scheme in its entirety has resulted in the full range of the reliefs available under the scheme being in place for less than two years and, as I said before, it is too early to consider the extension of the scheme beyond the areas designated. The monitoring and review of the scheme is ongoing and will be among the considerations which will inform any decision regarding the extension of the scheme to other rural areas.</P>

      <P>The practice of foreign investment firms seeking investments without appropriate authorisation has been a persistent problem in recent years. The supervisory authority is the Central Bank of Ireland. The bank informs me that it has been tackling the problem by: issuing notices in national newspapers warning the public about particular firms which have come to its attention &ndash; since mid-1998 the bank has named 59 firms in 29 notices; the issuance of a number of general warning notices in the media advising the public to ensure they only deal with properly authorised firms &ndash; the public can check if they are dealing with an authorised firm by calling the bank on a designated lo-call number which it has established, 1890 200 469; and by working with foreign regulatory authorities in the jurisdiction from which an unauthorised firm is operating. The problem has been raised by the bank at European <Col N="1272" /> level, in the Forum of European Securities Commissions Organisation in order that a European approach can be taken to this shared problem.</P>
      <P>I understand also that the bank's press office has been active in ensuring this issue has been highlighted in newspaper articles and on radio programmes on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The following were the issues on the agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, which I attended on 12 February 2001. On excise duty on mineral oils, ECOFIN finalised its discussions over lunch and approved conclusions relating to the general decision on the prolongation of derogations on excise duties for mineral oils. This paves the way for an early formal adoption of this decision and a series of specific derogations in this area.</P>
      <P>Under the heading, Preparation of the Stockholm European Council, two issues were discussed. They were: product and capital markets, where ECOFIN heard a presentation by Commissioner Bolkestein on the Commission's third report on the functioning of product and capital markets &ndash; the Commission's report will be taken into account in the preparation of a paper on the key issue of the broad economic policy guidelines for the Stockholm European Council in March; and broad economic policy guidelines, where ECOFIN Ministers welcomed the Presidency's approach on the key issues paper on the preparation of the broad economic policy guidelines and expressed broad agreement on the suggestions made and issues selected. On the basis of the discussion at ECOFIN, a draft key issues paper will be prepared and forwarded to the ECOFIN Council on 12 March for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the heading, EMU, two issues were discussed. They were: the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, where ECOFIN reached political agreement on a regulation on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting &ndash; the purpose of the regulation is to ensure a high degree of co-operation in protecting the euro against counterfeiting and to strengthen the legal frame<Col N="1274" /> work for protection of euro bank notes and coins in time for their introduction on 1 January 2002;</P>
    <P>and issues relating to euro coins, where Ministers welcomed initiatives for training vulnerable groups in the population in familiarising them selves with the euro notes and coins. Ministers also agreed on the adaptation of the conditions for loans of euro coins and-or tokens to the vending, coin-operated, industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supplementary and amending budget 1/2001 concerning BSE-related measures, ECOFIN confirmed an agreement reached in COREPER to finance a package of measures relating to BSE through the EU budget. These measures were agreed by the Agriculture Council in January.</P>
    <P>The Council heard a presentation by Commissioner Bolkestein on e-commerce and financial services. This issue is a critical element in the development of an integrated European market in financial services, which, as agreed by the Lisbon European Council, is due for completion by 2005. In this first exchange of views, Ministers had an opportunity to comment on the principles underlying the Commission communication. ECOFIN referred the draft of the second UCITS directive back to COREPER with the aim of reaching agreement by 1 March.</P>
    <P>The ECOFIN Council continued its cycle of annual review of member states' stability and growth and examined the programmes of Denmark, Ireland, Greece, France, Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom. The Council adopted its opinions on these programmes, as well as a recommendation relating to Ireland and a decision to publish this recommendation. In addition, the Council agreed to make the Council opinions public.</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Eurogroup president, Belgian Finance Minister Reynders, gave a short debriefing on the Eurogroup meeting which had been held earlier that morning. In addition, Mr Maystadt, president of the EIB, gave a brief overview of the activities of the EIB during 2000 and the Presidency informed Ministers of the current situation with regard to contacts with third countries in relation to negotiations concerning the taxation of savings. Discussion at lunch also included the issues of the grandfathering of bonds and the role of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.</P>

      <P>There are two official level committees which help prepare items for meetings of European Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN. The Economic and Financial Committee, EFC, formerly the Monetary Committee, assists in the preparation of ECOFIN agendas and focuses its attention on economic, budgetary and financial issues. The Economic Policy Committee, EPC, focuses on more medium and long-term economic reform issues.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked about the most recent meeting of the EPC. The agenda for the meeting of Economic Policy Committee attended by an official of my Department on 7 February 2001 consisted of the following issues: under the heading, Draft EPC Annual Report on Structural Reforms, three documents were discussed. They were &ndash; key messages from the 2001 country examinations, first draft of the full report, and a Commission document entitled, Economic Reform: report on the functioning of Community Product and Capital Market. This was followed by a presentation from the chairman of the internal market council working group, Horizontal Question, of that group's work in the framework of the Cardiff process and its contribution to the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines, BEPGs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a preparation of the orientation debate at ECOFIN on the 2001 Broad Economic <Col N="1276" /> Policy Guidelines.

    <P>The final item on the agenda was a report from the chairman on the work of the EPC working group on potential output and output gaps.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the above is a brief summary of the EPC's discussions and conclusions.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent budgets I provided for capital allowances in respect of buildings used as private registered nursing homes, convalescent homes and child care facilities. The capital allowances for nursing homes and convalescent homes are available at 15% per annum for years one to six and 10% in year seven. Accelerated capital allowances of 100% are available for child care facilities since budget 2000. In addition, the Finance Act, 1999, provided an exemption from a benefit-in-kind income tax charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme is involved, in both the management and financing of the child care facility.</P>
      <P>Following representations from employer bodies and to improve the operation of the BIK exemption for employer provided child care, the Finance Bill, 2001, contains proposals to extend the exemption where employers are involved in financing, but not managing the facility. In such circumstances, the exemption will be restricted to cases where the employer provides financial support for items of capital expenditure and equipment, but not other costs. Where the employer is involved in the management of the facility, the current conditions regarding financing of the facility will continue to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that under the normal self-assessment rules any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. However, the form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of nursing homes, private convalescent facilities or child care facilities from those <Col N="1277" /> claimed in respect of any other building that qualifies for capital allowances. Consequently, it is not possible for the Revenue to indicate the level of take up of these specific incentives.</P>
    <P>In relation to the BIK exemption for employees availing of employer provided child care places, information on the cost is not available as taxpayers are not required to provide details of this exemption in their tax returns.</P>

      <P>Article 19.1 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, states that &ldquo;The Governor shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.&rdquo; Last week the Government decided to seek the reappointment of the current Governor, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, for a further term in office. A key factor in making this recommendation to <Col N="1279" /> the President was my desire that the current Governor would continue in office in order to oversee the transition to the euro, which will be implemented early next year. As the 1942 Act provides for reappointment, no additional legislation is required. The Governor has agreed to his reappointment to oversee the introduction of the new currency.</P>

      <P>I pro<Col N="1280" /> pose to answer Questions Nos. 66, 207, 208 and 209 together.</P>
      <P>The economy is continuing to expand rapidly. It is estimated by my Department that GNP expanded by 8.6% in 2000. This continues the exceptional period of growth experienced since 1995.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that the economy will slow in the medium term. The latest set of projections that I published on budget day forecast growth in GNP terms of 7.4% this year, 5.4% in 2002 and 5.1% in 2003. It is projected by my Department that the economy can sustain growth rates of 5% per annum in GNP terms in the medium term. This takes account of prospective changes in employment and productivity.</P>
      <P>Others share this assessment of the economy's sustainable growth. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in its most recent medium-term review anticipates a growth rate for GNP over the next five years of around 5% a year.</P>
      <P>These projections assume that the international economy continues to expand and that a severe economic shock is avoided. Given the openness of the economy, we need to monitor external developments closely. The prudent management of economic and budgetary policy in recent years has put Ireland in a good position to cope with any external economic shocks.</P>
      <P>Ireland's economic success in recent years has been achieved through our ability to improve our international competitiveness. To achieve the economy's growth potential this competitiveness must be maintained.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the World Competitiveness Report ranked Ireland as the twenty second most competitive economy in the world. In 2000 Ireland was ranked seventh in the world. This improvement is due to a number of important factors, including the substantial investment in education and training in the last three decades; the implementation of the terms of successive national agreements, including the current Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has delivered moderate pay increases which, when combined with tax cuts, gave substantial increases in real take home pay; the radical restructuring of the tax system which has improved incentives to work; and the ongoing reform of product and capital markets and the promotion of competition and market liberalisation.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring our economy remains competitive and thereby sustains continued economic growth.</P>

      <P>Ireland's annual inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, was 5.2% in January 2001. This compares with a rate of 7% in November and 5.9% in December. The annual average rate of inflation was 2.4% in 1998, 1.6% in 1999 and 5.6% in 2000. The latest projections published by my Department on budget day forecast that inflation will average 4.5% in 2001, 3.5% in 2002 and 2.5% in 2003.</P>
      <P>Ireland's inflation rate, as measured by the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP, was 3.9% in January. This compares with 6% in November and 4.6% in December. The inflation rates of the 15 EU countries are set out in the Table below. This table shows that Ireland's inflation rate is lower than or close to the rate in several EU Member States.</P>

    <P>(b)January 2001 inflation rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> As the House is aware, inflation increased significantly during 2000 due to the sharp increase in oil prices, the fall in the value of the euro, increases in excise duty on tobacco, and an increase in underlying domestic inflation.</P>
    <P>Headline inflation has fallen in recent months because of the reduction in VAT and excise duties in the 2001 Budget and because the price of oil has fallen from its peak of over $30 per barrel in November 2000. This has been reflected in falls in retail petrol prices, and the euro has risen by more than 5% against both the US dollar and Sterling, reducing pressure on imported prices. I am aware of the concerns expressed by agencies such as the ESRI about the inflation rate. The Government shares these concerns and will continue to take action, where appropriate, to address price stability.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 80, 83 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in developing proposals for a new programme of decentralisation and I have recently commenced <Col N="1283" /> discussions with my Government colleagues on the matter with a view to formalising proposals for submission to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Decentralisation and thereafter to the Government for consideration and approval. In view of the range of issues which need to be considered I anticipate that the Cabinet Sub-Committee and the Government will take some time to complete their work. While it will be necessary to develop an implementation plan in relation to the Government decision, I intend that implementation of the new programme will be progressed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Given the range of views which have been taken into account in developing proposals for a new programme, including those of the SMI Implementation Group, I do not intend to establish a commission of senior civil servants to determine locations for inclusion in the new programme.</P>
    <P>While I am not aware of the specific level of interest in participation in a new programme of decentralisation and I am satisfied that the new programme will attract considerable interest throughout the civil and public service. I am both anxious and happy to take this opportunity to reiterate the voluntary nature of the new programme.</P>

      <P>Under valuation legislation, liability for rates is based on occupancy rather than the ownership of property. Rates have never been levied on State-occupied property, that is mainly property occupied by Government Departments and offices, Garda stations, Army barracks, prisons, State-occupied harbours and canals occupied by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. However, a contribution was made to local authorities in lieu of rates from the 1870s until 1987. The contribution was then subsumed into the rates support grant, now the local Government fund since 1999.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Bill, 2000, does not propose to change the position in relation to the rateability of State-occupied property. The Bill does, however, provide for the Commissioner of Valuation to value these properties in the first revaluation following enactment. This will allow for rates to be collected in respect of these properties should the Government decide at a later date to pursue that course of action.</P>

      <P>A new gender equality policy for the Civil Service has been developed by a high level gender equality management group, with representatives drawn from a number of Departments and chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner. It sets out a new strategic approach to equality of opportunity and forms part of the integrated human resource management policy for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The aim of the new policy is to ensure gender equality in all the human resource practices and procedures in the civil service, as well as addressing the need to increase the overall representation of women at senior management levels and to meet the target set by the Government that one third of assistant principal posts be filled by women by 2005.</P>
      <P>The new policy commits the civil service to distinct gender equality objectives in relation to the main human resource policy areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and staff development, promotion, and other work and family issues. A fundamental aspect of the policy is the adoption of strategic objectives, including specific targets, at the level of individual Department or office. The achievement of gender equality and, in particular, the achievement of the targets, will be supported by the development of a programme of affirmative action in the main human resource policy areas.</P>
      <P>The new policy was approved in principle by the Government in June 2000. Detailed discussions are under way currently with the unions on the text of the policy and on its detailed implementation by Departments. As the discussions are continuing I am not in a position to give definite dates for the final introduction of the policy. However, I can assure the Deputy that all the parties involved in the discussions are working to complete the talks as soon as possible, so that we can move quickly to the implementation of the policy.</P>

      <P>Good progress is being made in advancing the public private partnership programme initiated by the launch of the pilot projects on 1 June 1999. PPP projects are now being developed across most of the main sectors of public capital investment. The projects are on schedule with all key milestones being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> In the roads sector, a total of eleven schemes in the national road improvement programme have been identified by the National Roads Authority (NRA) for development as PPPs. These are concentrated on five major interurban routes to and from Dublin and comprise motorways, high quality dual carriageways and major river crossings that amount to approximately 230km. in total.</P>
    <P>The three PPP road projects announced in the pilot PPP programme announced on 1 June 1999 are the N25 Waterford bypass, incorporating a river crossing; the Limerick southern ring road phase two and Shannon Estuary crossing; the construction of a second bridge at the West-Link on the M50 in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitment to develop a stream of PPP projects creating an attractive market for PPP investment in Ireland, a further eight PPP road projects were announced in June 2000. The additional schemes are as follows:</P>
    <P>N1/M1 Dublin &ndash; Border route</P>
    <P>Dundalk western by pass</P>
    <P>N3 Cavan to Dublin route</P>
    <P>Clonee-Kells</P>
    <P>N4/N6 Galway to Dublin route</P>
    <P>Kilcock-Kinnegad (N4)</P>
    <P>Oranmore-N6 East (N6)</P>
    <P>N7 Limerick to Dublin route</P>
    <P>Portlaoise-Castletown*</P>
    <P>Nenagh-Limerick</P>
    <P>N8 Cork to Dublin route</P>
    <P>Portlaoise-Culahill*</P>
    <P>Fermoy By-Pass</P>
    <P>*Portlaoise-Castletown (N7) and Portlaoise-Culahill (N8), although separate schemes, will be placed as one PPP contract.</P>
    <P>The first two road projects in the marketplace are the Waterford bypass and river crossing and the N4 Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme which were published in the OJEC in December 2000. There has been an excellent response from the market and about 12 submissions for each project have been received by the NRA. These submissions involve almost 50 companies in joint ventures with significant overseas interest from Spain, Portugal, France, Sweden, Austria and the UK. The submissions are now being evaluated with a view to shortlisting four tenderers for each project by May 2001.</P>
    <P>The contract for the second West-Link Bridge is in the process of being finalised between the NRA and National Toll Roads. NTR requested tenders for the construction of the bridge in October 2000 and the construction tenders received are now being evaluated with a view to commencing construction by May this year. The statutory approval process for the other eight projects is currently under way with a view to a further five projects being launched into the market this year and the remaining two following early in 2002.</P>
    <P>The pilot projects for the education sector were launched in July 2000 and consist of the refur<Col N="1286" /> bishment-rebuild of the Cork School of Music and a bundle of five new build post-primary schools located in various parts of the country. Final bids from the three short-listed candidates for each of the two projects are being evaluated and preferred bidders will be appointed in March 2001. Consultants have now been appointed to assist in developing a National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, as a PPP project.</P>
    <P>In the public transport sector, a competition for the award of a contract to operate the first light rail line, Luas, in Dublin was advertised in the OJEC in January with the intention of selecting an operator by the end of 2001. Consultants have also been appointed to assist in planning the delivery of the Dublin Metro as a PPP.</P>
    <P>In the environment area, upwards of 100 projects with PPP potential have been identified by the Department of the Environment and Local Government under the water and sewerage programme 2000-02. To date 18 projects have been approved for development as PPPs and several of these projects are now at an advanced procurement stage. Two water supply projects are being developed as pilot PPP projects &ndash; Ballymore Eustace serving Dublin and Clareville serving Limerick &ndash; and both are expected to come to the market in the second quarter of this year. A pilot project in the solid waste management area is also under way in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Applying the criteria for dormancy of accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies, decided by Government in November last year, the total of these funds was estimated at approximately £140 million. However, it can be expected that this amount will fluctuate due to reactivation of the accounts and policies prior to the Scheme coming into operation in April 2002. The draft heads of Bill have been approved by Government and are with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting.

      <P>The Finance Bill, 2001, which I published on Thursday of last week, provides the legislative basis for the alignment of the income tax year and the capital gains tax year with the calendar year with effect <Col N="1287" /> from 1 January 2002. The Bill also provides the legislative basis for a transitional tax period or &ldquo;short tax year&rdquo; running from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. When the Bill is signed into law as the Finance Act, 2001, nothing further will need to be done in legislation to prepare for the first calendar tax year on 1 January, 2002. The Revenue Commissioners are making the necessary administrative preparations for the short tax year and the calendar tax year.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill provides that, in the short tax year, allowances, credits, reliefs, thresholds, qualifying days etc. will, in general, be reduced to 74% of their full year equivalents. The Bill makes consequential changes to the rules governing the basis of assessment of self-employed taxpayers in the context of the changeover to the calendar tax year and makes a number of changes to the rules on computation of preliminary tax in the early years of the new system.</P>
      <P>To coincide with the move to the calendar year, the Bill also provides for a common return filing and payment deadline of 31 October for those on the self-assessment system. This means that, by that date, taxpayers will be required to have filed their tax return for the preceding tax year and paid any balance of income tax and capital gains tax for that year, having taken credit for preliminary tax already paid. They will also be required to have paid their preliminary tax for the current tax year. As usual, the Government will announce the date of the next Budget in good time.</P>

      <P>A contract was placed by the Commissioners of Public Works in July 2000 for major refurbishment works at Farmleigh House. The budget, which also includes professional fees, statutory charges and fitting-out etc., is £14.72 million.</P>
      <P>The contractor is currently on site and completion of works is due by the end of June 2001. The main refurbishment project relates to the House and adjacent courtyard and will ensure that the House will be useable for the purpose for which it was purchased, namely as a venue for Government meetings and conference centre, including meetings requiring overnight accommodation and public access. The bulk of this work is required to upgrade services and facilities to convert the building from private to public use and to meet health and safety standards and public access requirements in the context of this changed use.</P>
      <P>In addition to the main refurbishment contract, other works on buildings within the Farmleigh Estate, including some on the House, are being carried out by the building maintenance service of the Office of Public Works, on an ongoing basis. The estimate for the cost of these to end June 2001 is £600,000 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estate's utilities are also being upgraded, contracts for which were placed in February 2001. These involve site infrastructural works such as a new ESB substation and boiler house, underground plumbing, gas and water mains, rationalisation of the ESB supply, telecommunications sys<Col N="1289" /> tems, new cables, external estate security systems etc. These works will service the House together with the satellite buildings and grounds of the estate.

      <P>Full information on progress made in the year 2000 on the operational programmes in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will not be available until the meetings of the monitoring committees for these programmes, which are due to be held within the next two months. However, on the basis of the information to hand, I can inform the Deputy that progress in implementing the NDP last year was satisfactory, especially in the key area of infrastructure provision. In this regard, expenditure under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme was over £2 billion, or 95% of target, with good progress recorded in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, there has been major work on the key inter-urban National Roads identified in the NDP, and new stretches of these roads, and of other roads in the network, will be opened this <Col N="1290" /> year. Moreover, progress in 2000 in planning and design will also enable further construction work to be advanced on all key routes in the current and future years. In environmental services, work is continuing nationwide on the construction of almost 80 major water and sewage schemes, and an additional 244 schemes will commence construction over the NDP period, 113 before end 2002. In public transport, the Tallaght and Sandyford Luas lines are on target to be operational by 2003. Moreover, last year, a significant number of new buses was added to Dublin and regional services and the capacity of Dublin suburban rail services was increased. Further new buses and suburban rolling stock will be introduced this year. In housing, health and education, physical output with a wide regional spread was generally on line with that projected in the NDP.</P>
    <P>Because of the many measures being implemented under the operational programme for employment and human resources development, a complete picture for 2000 as a whole is not yet available. However, it is expected that the actual outturn expenditure will be somewhat below that profiled in the NDP. This is not unusual during the first year of a programme, when expenditure arising from commitments under the previous plan was still being incurred.</P>
    <P>For partly the same reason, expenditure under the productive sector operational programme in 2000 is also expected to be below target. A further contributing factor were the delays encountered in receiving state aid approval from the European Commission for a number of schemes. However, I am pleased to note that more than 23,000 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in 2000, which is an all time record. In addition, 50% of all jobs negotiated by the IDA during 2000 in greenfield investment projects were secured for the BMW region, in line with the commitment in the NDP.</P>
    <P>In regard to the two regional operational programmes, there was excellent progress in non-national roads and rural water supply. In the important area of E-Commerce, the recent allocation by the Minister for Public Enterprise of some £60 million of NDP investment will induce gross investment of almost £200 million countrywide. Moreover, the commitment in 2000 of the first tranche of projects under the NDP childcare provision will create over 7000 additional child-care places throughout the country. By contrast, there was no expenditure on waste management because of delays in the adoption and implementation of waste management plans at regional or county level. Other measures on which no expenditure was incurred include urban and village renewal, seaports and airports, mainly because of delays in issuing calls for proposals. In sum, looking at the overall picture so far, I am happy with the progress of the NDP during its first year of operation and I am confident that the momentum built up last year will be sustained this year, and over the duration of the NDP.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue have informed me that they are currently considering the question of the most efficient and effective approach to recovering underlying tax in respect of funds concealed in bogus non-resident accounts. Given the potentially very large numbers of accounts involved, determining the appropriate approach requires careful consideration to ensure that the process of pursuing the liabilities is effective in recovering amounts due. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are preparing guidelines at <Col N="1293" /> present for taxpayers and their agents and that these will be issued after their analysis of the issues, including legal aspects, has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the circumstances the figures requested by her are not available at this stage. I understand that in advance of the main investigation by Revenue, a number of individuals with large accounts have made disclosures to Revenue. The payments on account made by these individuals to date amount to £6 million, that is an average payment of £130,000 in these particular cases. I am informed that no amount of outstanding tax has been written off in these cases, nor has any consideration been given to writing off underlying tax due by the holders of bogus non-resident accounts.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department formally notified the European Commission of the business elements of the new town renewal scheme on 19 July 2000 around the same time as the specific towns selected for the scheme were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Commission responded on 6 September 2000 with a request for additional information. The matter was then discussed in detail at meetings with the Commission and a reply has been sent to the Commission. As things stand, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the Commission. Such a delay is normal where Commission approval is concerned.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office was founded in 1949 and operates under the Statistics Act, 1993. The net total minus appropriation in aid of budget to year end 31 December 2000 was £22,211,000. The net total allocated for 2001 to CSO is £43,433,000. The reason for the significant increase in budget is that the census will be held this year.</P>

      <Col N="1294" /> There are a number of non-statutory bodies under my Department's aegis, while there are also a number of bodies such as the State legal offices for which I have ministerial responsibility in respect of certain administrative matters. None of these bodies are authorities, agencies, organisations or institutions which fully meet all the criteria in the Deputy's question.</P>

For the present CPI series &ndash; November 1996 = 100 &ndash; these estimates were derived from the results of the 1994-1995 house-hold budget survey, updated for price changes between this period and November 1996, which is the current reference period for the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>A number of initiatives are already in place in my Department to allow staff an opportunity to combine work and home life. These initiatives in common with the Civil Service in general include flexitime, parental, maternity, paternity and adoptive leave, as well as a job sharing scheme and a term time scheme. Staff may also avail of special leave to take care of domestic affairs, e.g. serious illness or old age of a relative, and may avail of a career break scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance has written to all Departments asking them to consider initiatives to mark Family Friendly Workplace Day and this matter is under consideration in my Department. <Col N="1298" /> My Department has also notified all the social partner organisations of this day. Funding has been allocated to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the National Development Plan and will be used primarily by the Equality Authority to support the work of the National Framework Committee. Full details of family friendly work arrangements will be available at www.familyfriendly.ie to be launched by the Tánaiste on 1 March, 2001.</P>

      <P>Funding, as agreed by the Oireachtas, is provided by my Department to a number of delivery agencies and statutory offices which operate under the aegis of my Department to enable them carry out their statutory functions. With the exception of the county enterprise boards this funding is not allocated on a county basis and consequently the information sought by the Deputy is not available. In respect of the county enterprise boards for Laois and Offaly following are the details of the funding allocated from 1995 to 2001. This funding was used to promote micro-enterprises in Laois and Offaly.</P>

      <Quest> the position in relation to the 1996 recommendation of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry that an independent ombudsman funded by the newspaper industry be appointed to investigate breaches of press standards; the reason this has not happened; and if the guidelines of press standards to be applied by the ombudsman which were to be produced by the newspaper industry within two months of the 1996 report have been finalised. </Quest>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, published in June 1996, recommended, <i>inter ali</i>a, that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established and that guidelines on press standards to be applied by the ombudsman be formulated. These recommendations were to be implemented by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>I understand that while some preparatory work has been done by the newspaper industry, the recommendations concerned have not yet been implemented. The industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department. I support the recommendations regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and the setting out of guidelines on press standards and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to provide for these matters.</P>

      <P>Community employment, CE, is an active labour market programme whose primary role is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. The general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the light of both the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure this programme, and the recommendations contained in the subsequent P2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. I have no plans in the short term to further amend the criteria pertaining to participation on the CE scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the opportunities available for unemployed persons in the open labour market has resulted in many projects finding it difficult to source eligible people. The numbers of long-term unemployed persons fell by 12,200 to 25,700 in the year to August, 2000. A review of active labour market programmes as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is due to commence during 2001 under the auspices of the standing committee on the labour market. The review will clearly have to have regard to the <Col N="1306" /> realities of rapidly falling long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>The social economy programme was formally launched on 18 September 2000. Its key aims are to support the regeneration and quality of life of local disadvantaged areas and to maximise employment opportunities for long-term unemployed and other dis-advantaged persons.</P>

Financial grants and technical supports are provided for the development of social economy businesses for up to three years. This includes grant support for the development of a business plan.</P>
      <P>Local working groups have been established by FÁS in consultation with area partnership companies, in the thirty-eight designated disadvantaged areas to draw up an agreed local strategy for the development of the programme. This includes the identification and prioritisation of new and innovative sectors of work activity where social economy enterprises will support the economic and social regeneration of the locality.</P>
      <P>The main partners represented on the local working groups include the trade union and employer organisations, area partnership companies, community and voluntary groups, local authorities, health boards, county enterprise boards and farmers' interests. Local working groups have also been set up by FÁS in non-partnership areas.</P>
      <P>A national advertisement campaign in regional and local newspapers has been run to promote the programme to community-voluntary groups. A social economy framework document and brochure has been distributed to local FÁS offices. Applications for social economy programme supports are being encouraged at a local level.</P>
      <P>The programme is almost at the half way stage in its first full year of operation. Up to January 2001, 119 applications for business plan grant support had been received by FÁS, 23 business plan grant applications had been approved and five social economy enterprises were approved for full grant support.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of £213 million on the social economy programme over the period 2000-06. A sum of £17 million has been allocated to the programme in 2001 and expenditure is forecast to rise to £41 million per annum as the demand for the programme increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 came into operation on 2 January 1997.</P>
      <P>It is designed to protect the safety, health and welfare of young workers and to ensure that work during the school year does not put the education of young persons at risk. When the Act came into operation, details of the legislation were sent to all post-primary schools, the relevant trade unions and employer bodies, the main supermarket chains, petrol stations, hotels, restaurants and vintners associations, fast food chains and youth organisations. They were sent to third level institutions as well as education officers in the relevant student unions last year. I have asked my officials to again make contact with all post-primary schools this year.</P>
      <P>The Act sets minimum age limits for the employment of &ldquo;children&rdquo;, that is, persons under the age of 16 and &ldquo;young persons&rdquo; that is, 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours, and prohibits the employment of under-18s on late night work. Employers must keep specified records of their workers who are under 18.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing employment legislation generally, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. The current designated strength of the inspectorate is 17. All inspectors carry out night work and that is almost exclusively related to PYP enforcement work. The labour inspectorate's business plan for 2001 provides for a minimum of 12% of the working time of inspectors to be carried out at night time in the enforcement of the PYP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employ<Col N="1310" /> ment) Act, 1996, was introduced for the purpose of safeguarding the welfare of young workers healthwise, safetywise and educationwise. It is my Department's policy to enforce proactively the Act as a response to the need itself and public-political expectations and demands. This responsibility is taken seriously as evidenced by the number of PYP-related inspections carried out by my Department in 2000 &ndash; 2,583, of which 757 were performed at night. Breaches of the Act may come to the attention of my Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. Inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records.</P>
    <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation, the matter is referred to my legal advisers to consider whether legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer. Experience of the labour inspectors is that most PYP irregularities found by them in the course of their inspection operations are resolved through the co-operation of the employers in question. Where such co-operation is not forthcoming it is the Department's policy to prosecute. Following referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal action against offending employers in 1998 one case resulted in a conviction of the employer concerned. There were no convictions in 1999 and six employers were convicted in 2000. In one further prosecution initiated in 2000 the employer was not convicted but was ordered to pay compensation to the young person concerned. To date, one employer has been convicted of breaches of the legislation, which included young persons working after 10 p.m. and, in that case, a substantial fine was imposed on the company. In addition, court hearings are pending in a further seven prosecutions under the Act. Regarding possible adverse impact of employment on attendance at classes my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 will replace current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally-based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    <P>It provides measures designed specifically for early school leavers. Section 29 provides that a young person, in effect in most cases 16 and 17 <Col N="1311" /> year olds, may register with the National Educational Welfare Board if they leave school before their 18th birthday. The board will, following consultation with the young person, parents and others, prepare a plan for their continuing education and training. Once that is done the board will issue a certificate to the young person concerned. The section goes on to provide that an employer cannot employ a young person unless he or she is the holder of a valid certificate. An employer is also obliged to inform the board within a month after a young person has been employed. The Act provides penalties for employers who breach these provisions. The overall thrust of the provisions is to place meaningful restrictions on the process whereby young people who are encouraged by immediate earning potential to leave education and training and take up often low-skill work. The provisions do not prevent young people taking up employment but seek to ensure that a balance is struck between their employment rights and their future educational, training and social needs. The Department of Education and Science is in the process of implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. It is also considered important that there be strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the 8-15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative. The objective of preventing early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and in order to have a real chance of success the solution must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>
    <P>While there is a legal obligation on employers to see that the law is upheld, there is also a moral responsibility on parents to ensure that the objectives of the Protection of Young Persons Act &ldquo;in regard to both the protection of the education and health of children and young persons&rdquo; are not frustrated. I urge parents and teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the labour inspectorate unit of my Department. Reported breaches will be dealt with and every effort made by the officials of my <Col N="1312" /> Department to eradicate non-compliance with the 1996 Act.</P>

      <P>The position is that my Department, in consultation with the Departments of Defence and Finance, has the primary responsibility to set the levels and standards of the air/sea support requirements for search and rescue &ndash; SAR. My Department is working closely with the Department of Defence to urgently replace the Alouette, which is in replacement on a temporary basis for the Dauphin which crashed on 2 July 1999, with an all-weather, night flying capacity at Waterford. I am not in a position at present to put any precise date on when the replacement will be in place although it is my hope that this can be achieved later this year.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, announced on 12 July 2000 the first stage of a process to acquire new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option for a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>

      <P>The general international practice, based on a recommendation of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a specialised agency of the United Nations, is that once children reach the age of 16 they must, if travelling abroad, other than to Britain, hold passports of their own. Persons of any age travelling in a group of up to 50 as part of an organised pilgrimage may avail of a group passport, only one fee of £45 having to be paid.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, has been pursuing a human rights dialogue with China since 1997. The case of Gedhun Chohekyi Nyima, the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama, has been repeatedly raised with China at the sessions of this dialogue. In response, China has informed the EU that he is in good health and is attending primary school. However, despite repeated attempts, the EU has not succeeded to date in securing a visit by an independent delegation to the young Panchen Lama and his family.</P>
      <P>The next round of the EU-China human rights dialogue will take place in Stockholm later this week on 22-23 February. The case of Gedhun Chohekyi Nyima, the Panchen Lama, will again be raised with China at this meeting. The EU delegation will also repeat its request that an independent delegation be given access to the Panchen Lama. This EU objective was underlined in the recent review of the EU-China human rights dialogue which was endorsed by the General Affairs Council on 22 January 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the total funding allocated each year from 1995 to 2001 by her Department for Counties Laois and Offaly; and the major developments that began or major service improvements that were funded as a result of an increase in funding in each of these years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to funding allocated to Counties Laois and Offaly is as follows. Construction of the new 120MW peat fired station at Clonbullogue, near Edenderry, County Offaly, commenced in January 1999. This new station came into commercial operation in December 2000, six months ahead of schedule. The new station was developed by the Finnish company, IVO, at an estimated cost of approximately £100 million. The station is in receipt of an EU grant of £21 million of which £16 million has been drawn down in the years 1999 to date. The balance of the cost is funded by the developer.</P>
      <P>A project to develop wetland, wildlife and to research the related ecological process commenced in 1995. Total funding of £708,694 was provided under the energy subprogramme of the operational programme on economic infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £77,000 was spent in Laois and £107,000 was spent in Offaly on energy efficiency measures between 1995 and 2001. Funding was administered by the Irish Energy Centre on behalf of the Department under the energy audit grant scheme &ndash; EAGS &ndash; and the energy efficiency investment support scheme &ndash; EEISS <Col N="1323" />&ndash; of the economic infrastructure operational Programme. The EAGS encouraged industry and the commercial sector to identify energy saving opportunities through carrying out audits of their energy usage. The EEISS provided grant assistance to industry and the commercial sector for investment in proven energy efficient technology and systems. Both schemes were co-funded by the European regional development fund.</P>
    <P>There have been many benefits from investment in public transport, particularly on rail services and cross county boundaries. It is not possible to associate investment with individual counties. However, I understand Bus Éireann has made a number of improvements to bus services in the Laois-Offaly area. It introduced an hourly service between Dublin and Limerick in May 1999 and a two hourly service between Dublin and Cork in July 2000. These services transit through Laois and Offaly. Arising from increased customer demand in the Portlaoise area, an additional auxiliary service was introduced on the Mountmellick route in September 2000 and in January 2001 the service was extended to Mountrath to provide a morning commuter service to Dublin. Returning passengers can avail of the Dublin-Limerick hourly service. Under the national development plan, Bus Éireann service frequency on the Dublin-Edenderry route has been increased substantially from six to 20 services on weekdays. Service frequency ranges from hourly to half hourly at peak times from Dublin while services from Edenderry operate to an hourly frequency increasing to 15 minutes in the very early morning peak.</P>
    <P>There has also been substantial investment in the mainline rail network. Between 1994 and 2000, in excess of £150 million has been invested in upgrading mainline rail. This covered the acquisition of additional mainline rail rolling stock and track renewal. In addition, £175 million has been invested to date in the rail safety programme since 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>The community application of information technology &ndash; CAIT &ndash; initiative seeks to fund demonstration projects which encourage and assist those in our society who are unfamiliar with, and who do not use, the new information and communications technologies in their everyday lives. It is intended that the community and voluntary sector would undertake these projects. Over £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the information society fund over the period April 2001 to November 2002.</P>
      <P>In excess of 450 proposals were received before the deadline of 15 February last. In the next number of weeks an independent steering group containing representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, other Departments and the private sector will consider all of these proposals and make recommendations for funding. The CAIT initiative is just one of many initiatives being undertaken as part of a wider Government programme to ensure a fully inclusive information society in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland &ndash; CITI &ndash; is the competent body appointed to administer the training and examination of CPC candidates within the State in keeping with standards under EU Directive 98/76/EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of Directive 98/76/EC, where a person normally resident in the Republic obtains a certificate of professional competence in Northern Ireland after 1 October 1999, my Department is not obliged to recognise the CPC as valid for licensing purposes unless that person passes an additional examination set by the CITI. Consequently, no real incentive or benefit is <Col N="1325" /> gained by sitting the CPC examination in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Figures provided by the CITI do not support the assertion that there has been a total collapse of demand for the Republic's CPC examinations in the regions accessible to Northern Ireland. A comparison between the September 1999 examination, prior to the coming into effect of the new directive, and the June 2000 examination, held under the new rules, shows that for the country as a whole, 431 candidates sat the 1999 examination while 470 sat the June 2000 examination. The figures for the Letterkenny examination centre show six for 1999 and 14 for 2000, while the Sligo figures were nil in 1999 and 15 in 2000. Castlebar had 16 and 23 respectively. Only the Castleblayney centre showed a reduction from 85 in 1999 to 49 in 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the standards for access to the professions and will maintain a policy of ensuring that applicants for road haulage and road passenger transport licences are adequately qualified to effectively manage and control the undertakings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function in relation to this matter. It is a day to day matter for the board of Iarnród Éireann. However, Iarnród Éireann informs me that it introduced a new DART service to Malahide in mid December last, following <Col N="1327" /> the placing into service of ten additional DART carriages. In addition, some DART trains have been increased from four to six carriages. All available DART carriages are in use at peak times. The position will improve further at the end of April when a further 16 new DART carriages are commissioned. In the meantime, additional drivers will have been recruited and trained which will enhance reliability. In all, there will be an increase of almost 30% in DART capacity, compared to November last.</P>
      <P>To cater for general growth in demand for DART services over the coming years, the national development plan provides for a further 12 new DART carriages to be delivered to Iarnród Éireann in the last quarter of this year, which, when operational in late Spring 2002, will result in an increase in the capacity of DART services by over 40% in the period since November last. In addition, Iarnród Éireann has an option on a further 36 new DART carriages. Plans are in hand to extend all DART platforms to accommodate eight carriage trains. Iarnród Éireann has in recent days submitted to me proposals for a major investment project to increase the frequency of trains on the northern suburban rail network by providing enhanced signalling, all eight car trains, improved power supply on the overhead power lines and the upgrading of the current two track system to three tracks. These proposals are now being examined.</P>

The main projects commenced by Iarnród Éireann in the Waterford area in 2000 related to the safety investment programme. In 2000, 6.5 miles of track were renewed on the Dublin-Waterford line and five level crossings were upgraded. This programme will continue in 2001 when it is planned to relay ten miles of track, upgrade 12 level crossings and replace three bridges. The 2000 programme amounted to approximately £3 million and the 2001 programme will cost approximately £5 million.</P>

      <P>In 1996, Iarnród Éireann sought European regional development fund grant aid for the construction of a number of new stations and the upgrading of some existing stations. These included Kilcock, Drumcondra, Clontarf Road and Barrow Street. The total cost of the package was estimated at approximately £5 million, of which £2.2 million was included for Barrow Street. This was an indicative cost estimate and before any detailed design or precise cost estimates had been prepared.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann subsequently commenced detailed design work and costings on the station and submitted the project for planning permission in 1997. Final planning permission was received in mid-1999 and Iarnród Éireann then went to tender, based on the approved design and more complete costings. Work commenced in autumn 1999 and was completed in December 2000. The station opened on 22 January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The final cost of the station was £4.4 million. The contracted work on buildings and platforms amounted to £2.1 million. A further £1.5 million was expended on track work, signalling and alterations to overhead line equipment. Approximately £0.6 million was spent on relocating a machine maintenance depot from the site. Iarnród Éireann's project management cost of £0.2 million accounts for the balance.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a metro, the extension of Luas lines and for a number of other proposals leading to an integrated public transport system for Dublin are incorporated in the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, 2000-2016, &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;, which was presented to the Government last year. Included in the metro and Luas proposals are a number of routes in the Dublin North-West constituency.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office is currently preparing an implementation plan for the strategy. The DTO has set out a target of early March for the completion of this work, which will then form the basis for Government decisions on the various projects proposed.</P>
      <P>However, the Government has already approved, in principle, the development of the metro system. Immediately following this decision, in July 2000, I asked the light rail project office of CIE to commence the necessary preparatory work on the metro and report progress to me on a regular basis. This work is proceeding and I hope to bring specific proposals to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the delivery of the metro and Luas lines has the necessary focus, I propose to establish a railway infrastructure agency which will be given responsibility for exploring the potential for public-private partnerships and for procuring new rail-based infrastructure. The Bill providing for the establishment of the agency will be published next month.</P>
      <P>While I am not yet in a position to say what the timescale for delivery of the various projects will be for Dublin North-West, I hope the establishment of the new agency will facilitate the rapid development of the metro and additional light rail lines throughout the city.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Defence Forces' participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, I refer the Deputy to my reply to the House to Questions Nos. 35 and 87 on 14 February 2001. As I indicated to the House on that date, the UN Security Council has requested the UN Secretary General to submit a detailed report by 30 April 2001 on UNIFIL reconfiguration plans and on the tasks that could be carried out by observers as part of the United Nations' truce supervision organisation. On foot of this report, the Security Council will review the situation in early May 2001, and will consider any steps it deems appropriate regarding UNIFIL and UNTSO.</P>
      <P>The Security Council will be due to consider the UNIFIL mandate in July 2001. The review by the Secretary General in early May 2001 will determine the nature and the level of the force/s to be deployed in south Lebanon for the longer term.</P>
      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions, including during visits to Lebanon and UN headquarters, my desire that the Irish battalion could withdraw from UNIFIL by the end of this year on the basis that the task of UNIFIL has largely been completed. I consider, however, that the six months' rotation in April 2001 will, unless requested otherwise by the UN, take place, and I propose seeking the approval of the Government to deploy a contingent in April 2001. A battalion is currently in training to this end.</P>

      <P>The herd to which the Deputy refers was first valued on 7 February and I understand that the herd owner has not indicated to my Department that he wishes to proceed to a second stage valuation.

      <P>The area aid unit did not receive a 2000 area aid application from the person named, therefore no headage or premia payments could have been made to him. However, in recent days a copy of his application along with a certificate of postage has been received to support his contention that he submitted his 2000 area aid application on time. In the <Col N="1335" /> light of these circumstances his 2000 area aid application has now been accepted.</P>
      <P>The person named claimed a total of 10.18 hectares on his area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 9.74 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.44 hectares or 4.52% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, the penalty is based on double the difference when the difference between area claimed and area found is between 3% and 20%. Therefore, in this case a penalty of 0.88 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 8.86 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>One of the objectives of the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme is to maintain the farming population in those areas, and it is considered that this objective is best met by confining payment of grants to farmers, who if not living in the disadvantaged areas, are living within daily commuting distance of their holdings in a disadvantaged area. In the context of meeting this objective it is considered that a distance of no more than 70 miles is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Applicants under this scheme must be producing cow's milk for disposal from their holdings and must have milk quotas of less than 30,638 gallons on 31 March 2000-1 April 2000. They must also give undertakings not to increase their milk quotas either temporarily or permanently to 30,638 or more gallons during an unbroken 12 months period from the date of application.</P>
      <P>The person named declared on his application that he held a milk-quota of 24,054 gallons on 31 March 2000. On 19 June 2000, he obtained 690 gallons of extra quota from the 15 million gallon allocation to Ireland under Agenda 2000. He also purchased 6,638 gallons of extra quota on 11 July 2000. The total milk quota held by the person named from 11 July 2000 was 31,382 gallons, which is in excess of the 30,638 limit. Accordingly he is not eligible for any suckler cow premium for 2000.</P>

Current rules on payment preclude member states from payment of aid to establishments which fail to meet the standards laid down by EU and national legislation.

      <P>Supplementary measure three of the REP scheme provides for additional payments to be made to REPS participants who rear listed local breeds in danger of extinction. Breeds listed on the food and agri<Col N="1338" /> culture organisation list as being endangered are eligible for payment.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the new scheme as submitted to the EU Commission under the rural development plan did include the Galway sheep as an endangered breed eligible for payment under supplementary measure three. As the Galway sheep is not on the FAO list of endangered breeds, however, it does not meet the eligibility criteria for payment under REPS. Any future changes in the food and agriculture organisation list of endangered species may be reflected in the REP scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards breeding, the Department, in conjunction with the Galway Sheep Breed Society, operates a breed improvement programme to cater specifically for the Galway breed. The objective of this programme is to improve litter size through on-farm recording and selection within the breed. The Department is conscious that the Galway breed is our only native sheep breed and, when crossed with recorded high-genetic merit rams, produces lambs that are well suited to our main home and export markets.</P>

      <P>His pension had been suspended in August 2000 at which time he was made aware that legal documentation, relating to a replacement transferee, was incomplete because evidence of compliance with the enlargement rule had not been provided. The required documentation was received at the end of November 2000 and payment has been restored from that point on. My Department is obliged to withhold the pension for the intervening period as the terms of the scheme were not being complied with. The person named has been given an opportunity to appeal the decision.</P>

      <P>As regards the possibility of funding of projects under Leader, my Department is currently in negotiation with the European Commission with a view to obtaining the Commission's approval for the Leader operational programme and final approval for the national rural development programme. On receipt of approval, the way will be clear for finalisation of the selection of groups and their appointment by Government. Following this, funding will be allocated to the appointed Leader groups.</P>
      <P>Leader groups themselves receive and process applications made by promoters seeking funding for projects. The submission of projects for Leader funding cannot take place until such time as the Leader groups which will deliver the programmes in the period to 2006 are in place.</P>
      <P>In the allocation of Leader funding in the period to 2006, the findings of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems will be taken into account. The requirement is that overlap in delivery of local programmes should be avoided to minimise any duplication so as to maximise the allocated resources.</P>

      <P>I am aware that recent medical research has shown that some non-unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid have been found to be protective against heart disease. To this end Teagasc has examined the potential through which the concentrations of these healthy fatty acids in beef can be increased through different feeding regimes, particularly grass-based diets. This research has concluded that beef produced in this manner could be considered a low fat food and showed a marked increase in conjugated linoleic acid content. Research on the subject is ongoing to assist the production of beef with these pre-defined characteristics.</P>

      <P>Compensation for reductions incurred in 2000 is set at 75% and the European Commission gave approval on 12 January 2001 for payment. Arrangements have been made for payment and most of the participants who are entitled to compensation will receive it with their March payments. A small number whose cases have to be calculated individually will be paid in April.</P>
      <P>The reduction in rates of pension arose from the introduction of the euro in January 1999. The rate of pension under the previous scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the punt on the introduction of the euro resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension.</P>
      <P>While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three year scheme of compensation. During 2000, full compensation was paid to all participants in the scheme whose payments had been reduced during 1999. Compensation for losses during 2000 is set at 75%. The compensation scheme provides for a third payment in respect of reductions in payments during 2001 and approval for this payment will be sought from the European Commission in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The performance of the Irish economy in recent years in terms of strong growth in output and employment has been exceptional both by international standards and in terms of our own experience. A combination of sound economic and budgetary policies linked to social consensus, positive demographic factors, strong foreign direct investment and EU transfers has resulted in a transformation of our economic situation.</P>
      <P>Ireland's growth has been well balanced with all the main components of demand contributing to the robust performance. It is estimated that real GNP increased by around 8.6% in 2000. This follows on average growth of 7.8% since 1993. Our economic success is most clearly reflected in the fact that, at the end of last year, unemployment reached a record low of under 4%.</P>
      <P>One of the key requirements in maintaining competitiveness is to ensure that our vulnerability to economic shocks from external sources is minimised and that we are in a position to cope effectively with them should they occur. In this context the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is a cornerstone of economic policy and it is essential that it continues to be implemented in a manner which provides a stable foundation for continued economic growth. Measures to promote structural reform to increase competition are also important. Pursuit of excessive expectations would inevitably damage economic and employment growth, push up unemployment and undermine our capacity for further social progress. It is also vital to ensure that infrastructural constraints are addressed and that we continue to encourage increased labour force participation. These considerations have been at the core of the Government's economic policy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has been particularly successful in attracting US investment, while that country is also an important export destination. On both counts Ireland has some exposure to any downturn in the US economy. The core response is to continue the thrust of existing Government policy and, in particular, to build on achievements to date in developing our national competitiveness in the broadest sense of that term.</P>

    <P>In the budget for 2001 I abolished probate tax in respect of deaths occurring on or after budget day &ndash; 6 December 2000.</P>
    <P>In the case of probate tax arising on estates where the death occurred before 6 December 2000, the tax is charged at a rate of 2% on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased whether the assets passed under will or intestacy. Estates with a taxable value of £40,000 or less are exempt from the tax. A total exemption from probate tax is available where property passes to a spouse and where jointly owned property passes automatically from one joint owner to another joint owner. In addition, the share of the family home passing to dependent children or dependent relatives of the deceased is exempt subject to certain conditions. There are other exemptions for pension benefits, charitable bequests, heritage property and the proceeds of section 60 insurance policies which are used to pay inheritance tax/ probate tax. Agricultural land and buildings may <Col N="1346" /> also be reduced in value by 30% for probate tax purposes. There is also provision in the legislation for deferral of the tax by the Revenue Commissioners in cases of hardship or where the estate is illiquid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This cases relates to the sale of a site in Shankill. The Commissioners of Public Works offered a site for sale by public auction on 24 March 1994. The bid from the prospective purchaser was accepted and the contract was signed by him. The closing date was set for 17 June 1994, but he failed to close on the day. Despite repeated requests to close issued from the office of the Chief State Solicitor, in particular by a completion notice dated 7 July 1994, and by further letters dated 17 July 1994, 5 August 1994 and 18 August 1994, the contract was not completed by him.</P>
      <P>As matters had not progressed, the commissioners issued a plenary summons in October 1994 against him. The case was heard in the High Court in June 1996. The proceedings commenced as specific performance proceedings to enforce the sale of the site. As the prospective purchaser did not seek specific performance in his defence, leave was granted by the court to the commissioners to amend their statement of claim to seek in lieu of specific performance a declaration that the sale agreement was being rescinded and sale deposit forfeited.</P>
      <P>In his amended defence the prospective purchaser did not seek specific performance to enforce the sale. His defence contains an admission to the recession of the agreement but a claim to entitlement to return of the deposit. The deposit is the only issue now outstanding in this case and a response has not been received to the offer already made by the commissioners.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of court proceedings some correspondence took place during 1995 with the prospective purchaser. The particular details supplied by the Deputy in his question relate to a letter to the purchaser issued by the office of the Chief State Solicitor on 7 March 1995 which conveyed the intention of the commissioners to forfeit the deposit under the conditions of the contract and put the site up for resale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the letter the prospective pur<Col N="1347" /> chaser requested a meeting which took place at the office of the Chief State Solicitor on 2 June 1995. At the meeting he indicated his intention to close the sale within three to four weeks. He stated that if that was not acceptable he was prepared to accept a refund on his deposit. It was pointed out to him that the delay in closing the sale had attracted interest and other costs which would have to be paid. He then took the position that if he was to close the sale, interest would have to be waived, or a substantial reduction negotiated. This arrangement was not acceptable to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>A further proposal in relation to sale of the site was received from the prospective purchaser in June 1995 indicating his willingness to close the sale at a discounted price. That proposal was also not considered acceptable.</P>
    <P>A number of requests to close the sale were received since 1996. The records show that two requests were received during 1996 from the legal representatives of the prospective purchaser. The response in both cases was that the amounts offered were unacceptable having regard to the amount of interest and costs accrued and the increased value of the property. A further request to close was made in August 1997 at a meeting at the offices of the Chief State Solicitor. An offer to close at that stage was not considered appropriate as the case was ready for hearing in the Circuit Court to deal with the matter of the deposit.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Commissioners of Public Works did not in any way impede closure of a sale. In dealing with this matter the commissioners from the outset followed the advice of the office of the Chief State Solicitor. The prospective purchaser was given every opportunity to complete the transaction and failed to do so.</P>

      <P>There are two bodies which fall fully within the scope of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank was established under the Central Bank Act, 1942. According to its 1999 annual report, the Central Bank's total operating costs in 1999 were 38.6 million euros. The bank's profit before unrealised gains in 1999 was 248 million euros, of which 213.4 million euros were remitted to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was established in 1990 under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990. Its principal function is to manage the national debt on behalf of the Minister for Finance. The chief executive officer of the agency is directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.</P>
      <P>The operating expenses of the NTMA are met directly from the central fund and comprise part of the debt service budget. The agency's expenses in the year 2000 amounted to £6.3 million. Its estimated expenses for the year 2001 are £10.5 million. More than £3 million of these costs represent expenditure on new functions which have been allocated to the agency, that is, management of the national pensions reserve fund, the State claims agency and the central treasury service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission which I will establish shortly. The function of the commission will be to control and manage the national pensions reserve fund which will be used <Col N="1349" /> to part pre-fund the increased cost of future social welfare and public service pensions as the population ages and the ratio of pensioners to workers increases. The chairperson of the commission will be directly accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the fund. The expenses of the commission will be charged on the fund.</P>

      <P>The committee's report recommended that funds be allocated to ensure necessary maintenance of the Shannon system. However, as no scheme of works has been undertaken on the Shannon under the Arterial Drainage Acts, no standard has been set to which the river must be maintained. Also, any proposed works would have to have regard to factors such as planning and environmental considerations and possible collateral impacts. Therefore, in the context of my statement to the Seanad on 5 December 2000 in relation to the interim report, I asked the committee to revisit and elaborate on the recommendation in its final report.

I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

      <P>However, as the Deputy may be aware, the Finance Bill, 2001, provides for a new tax relief for donations of money. The initiative represents a major simplification and extension of existing reliefs. Relief will be available at a taxpayer's marginal rate of tax for both personal and corporate donations. The minimum donation qualifying will be £250 and there will be no limit on the total amount of relief afforded to individuals or companies. The new relief will apply to a wide range of bodies, including charities which have been charitably exempt for tax purposes for three years, as well as educational establishments. I am confident that this new measure will be of significant benefit to private organisations and charities, such as An Taisce, in raising money for worthwhile causes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary cause of the flooding in November 2000 was the volume and intensity of rainfall. The rainfall in early November last, one of the wettest on record, particularly in the south and east, gave rise to flooding in many parts of the country, not least in parts of County Kildare, where the effects of the rainfall caused <Col N="1355" /> localised flooding over widespread areas of the county. It is estimated that the November flooding has a return period in excess of 50 years.</P>
      <P>Since the reasons for the flooding impacting on one individual area over another may be subject to particular localised contributory factors and be as varied as the distribution of the locations, it would not be practicable to address all the flooding problems in the county as a single issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that priority is being accorded the flooding problems in the Hazelhatch area of Celbridge, County Kildare in that the area has been the subject of survey and investigation by the Office of Public Works and the extent of the remedial works required to alleviate flooding has been identified in the Shinkeen Stream, Hazelhatch draining scheme for which a flood relief scheme is expected to reach works stage this spring.</P>

      <P>However, in the interim and in addition to their existing flood relief programme of investigations and works, it has been possible for the Office of Public Works to discuss the flooding problems of November with several local authorities and to establish technical works groups with some councils for the alleviation of flooding in a number of major urban areas which are subject to periodical localised flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of resources and preparation in the banking system is primarily a matter for the banks, but I am assured by the Irish Bankers Federation that their preparations, which commenced in 1996 are well advanced. I am satisfied that the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland also has adequate resources and preparation in hand for the introduction of the euro. The Estimate for my Department this year provides for £14.678 million towards the work of the Euro Changeover Board: total expenditure of the board last year was some £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>The changeover to the euro involves preparation of legislation, production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector and businesses, consumer matters and the provision of widescale public information. Substantial progress has been made to date under each of these headings and further extensive preparations are in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much legislation dealing with the euro has already been put in place at EU and national level. More recently, the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill, 2001, which I published on 5 February 2001, provides for the substitution, with <Col N="1358" /> effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and statutory instruments. With the Finance Bill, 2001, the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, and other forthcoming legislation it will provide an appropriate framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002, in the principal areas of law under which citizens regularly transact business with the State. Irish pound amounts in law that are not affected by this national legislation will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate, under Council Regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>
    <P>Production of euro bank notes and coins by the Central Bank is on target, while Departments confirm that progress on preparations by the public sector is satisfactory. These preparations will continue to be monitored by my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards preparations by business, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has provided extensive information to help businesses to prepare for the changeover. The results of a recent Forfás survey on business preparedness were announced at the national conference on the Loughrea Euro Town project yesterday. They indicate that business preparations have been increasing, though clearly there is more to be done. Earlier this month the Forfás campaign began fresh radio advertising aimed specifically at business, and advertising will continue on a phased basis. Forfás is also continuing a programme of presentations to business, trade and professional organisations and participating in exhibitions and conferences aimed in particular at SMEs. Consumer matters are for the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and for the Director of Consumer Affairs. The national code of practice on the euro changeover was relaunched by them last December, with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover. I understand interest in the national code or an approved sectoral code under it is increasing among retailers. A significant number of premises have dual pricing of products or final price on till receipts and it is expected that the level of dual display will rise sharply closer to 1 October 2001, the date for its commencement under national and sectoral codes. Under the codes, dual display will continue until 9 March 2002, a month after the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins.</P>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, has carried out extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included a leaflet to every household in 1998, 1999 and 2000, widespread circulation of posters and leaflets, provision of a local inquiry line, 1890 20 10 50, and website, www.euro.ie, distribution of information packs to schools and guidelines to every teacher, provision of materials for people with special needs, for example, literacy difficulties, and provision of part-funding for activities by non-governmental organisations in <Col N="1359" /> promoting euro awareness. The ECBI has also run extensive advertising campaigns. A November 2000 public awareness survey by the board showed that at that stage, 77% of people knew the year of introduction of euro cash and 83% of these knew the month. Both these figures are significantly up since the previous survey in July. A national television, radio and press campaign stressing the January introduction date and the value of the Irish pound in euro commenced in early January and ran until mid-February. A train-the-trainers pack is being made widely available for general use. The needs of low-awareness groups are being addressed and continue to be addressed through the board's consultative panel, composed of organisations representing people in low-awareness groups and people likely to have special needs in the change-over.</P>
    <P>Many of the projects in the board's NGO programme relate to these groups.</P>

Their income consists of a farm retirement pension and income from the lease of their farm land. The first £6,000 of the taxpayers' income from the lease of the farm land is exempt from income tax. The taxpayers' agent has claimed that exemption in their return of income for the 1999-2000 tax year. The taxpayers' income from the lease of their land, except for the first £6,000 which is exempt from income tax, and their retirement pension is subject to income tax in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of <Col N="1361" /> the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges.</P>
      <P>In respect of drug costs the drug payment scheme was introduced on 1 July 1999 to streamline the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which it replaced, merge the best elements of the schemes and significantly improve cash flow for families incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family has to pay more than the first £42 of the cost of approved prescribed medicines. Once an individual or family has spent a total of £42 on approved prescribed medicines in a month, the cost of any further approved prescribed items that month is paid for by the State.</P>
      <P>A person may also qualify for income tax relief in respect of certain unreimbursed medical expenses, including hospital expenses, prescribed medicines and general practitioner costs under a Revenue Commissioners scheme. In respect of cancer services specifically, considerable developments have taken place in the area of cancer services since the launch of the national cancer strategy in 1996 and the subsequent action plan for its implementation which was launched in 1997. To date £60 million has been invested under the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is a driver, and £12,500 if the qualifying person is a passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per year and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001, and from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme will be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. It was on this basis that the Minister for Finance approved the increase in the mobility allowance payment from £45.60 to £90 per month.</P>
      <P>By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at eligible people with disabilities who do not enjoy these advantages. I intend however to keep the situation under review and to consult with interested parties on the matter. On 31 December 2000 there were 2,937 people in receipt of mobility allowance. As the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, detailed information relating to beneficiaries of this scheme is not available in my Department.</P>

    <P>Representations regarding an increase in the weekly rate of disability allowance to £100 from the organisation mentioned by the Deputy have been received in my Department. However, as this allowance comes under the remit of the Department of Social, Community and Family <Col N="1366" /> Affairs the representations have been forwarded to that Department for its attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to needs of carers who care for people with disabilities, I was pleased to be able to make additional funding of £450,000 available in 2001 for further improvements in the domiciliary care allowance scheme. The following changes will come into effect on the 1 April 2001: the requirement that the handicap must have been present for six months prior to the date of application is being abolished, which means that from the 1 April 2001 payment of the allowance will be made from the date of application; and children who normally reside in special schools or institutions and who spend periods at home, for example, weekends or holidays, will from the 1 April 2001 receive a <i>pro rata </i>payment of the domiciliary care allowance. Furthermore, my Department made additional funding of £950,000 available in 2001 to support an increase in the respite care grant in respect of recipients of domiciliary care allowance. The grant, which will be payable in the first week of June, is being increased from £300 to £400 and is being extended to a second eligible child in a family in line with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs budget provision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question concerning a proposal relating to an Ombudsman or Minister with responsibility for people with disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the role of the Ombudsman in the protection of citizens' rights already extends to people with disabilities. Furthermore, my colleague Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has special responsibility for people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have again reviewed the case of the person to whom Deputy O'Shea refers. The person in question was an independent student public health nurse during the 1999-2000 academic year. By virtue of a July 2000 agreement between my Department and the Irish Nurses Organisation, all such students had course fees refunded and were paid for the clinical placement period. From the 2000 intake onwards, all student public health nurses are being sponsored by health boards and the Department is funding the payment of salaries and course fees. This arrangement also applied to 1999-2000 sponsored students.</P>
      <P>Sponsored student public health nurses are now being properly recognised as employees for whom permanent posts are reserved on successful completion of their course. This is in keeping with the original circular 27/66 which provided for sponsorship in the first instance. As employees they are paid a salary while training and in return are expected to provide a commitment to work for their sponsoring health board for at least two years following qualification.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the person in question worked as a locum PHN with the South Eastern Health Board before, during and following completion of her course, but she was not sponsored by the board while training. Independent student public health nurses were not recognised as employees in the way that sponsored students were. Consequently, it is not possible to provide for payment of salary for periods other than the periods actually worked.</P>
      <P>Finally, the person in question was employed as a temporary public health nurse with the South Eastern Health Board on completion of her course. I understand that agreement has now been reached between the board and the INO on a conversion process for temporary public health nurses and that the individual in question should qualify for a permanent post under this process.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the World Health Organisation has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area regarding possible adverse health effects from radio frequency fields associated with mobile phone systems. The WHO has stated that none of these reviews has concluded that exposure to radio-frequency fields from mobile phones or their transmitters masts, sometimes referred to as base stations, causes any adverse health consequences.</P>
      <P>The WHO has also identified a need for further research to better assess possible health risks. A large epidemiology study is being co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, which is a specialised research agency of the WHO. This study will try to identify if there are links between the use of mobile phones and head and neck cancers. The study is anticipated to be completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, has developed guidelines for radio-frequency exposure levels. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all scientific literature including thermal and non-thermal effects. The WHO recommend strict adherence to these guidelines and mobile phone companies licensed to operate here are required to comply with them.</P>

      <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The provision to assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent was deleted with effect from 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Although legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances, in the interests of fairness and natural justice, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision and the approval of the Minister for Finance has been obtained. It is expected that the cost of making these payments will be in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and all the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis.

      <P>Children aged 16 to 18 are currently treated by the adult psychiatric services. However, the placement of children of this age in adult psychiatric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate. A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development. This group will also examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years, in conjunction with experts from the field of adult psychiatry, to determine how these can best be addressed in the context of future service developments.</P>
      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas, provides for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. It provides for different legal procedures to be followed with regard to the detention of adults and of children under 18. It does not contain any provisions regarding the age for admission to psychiatric hospitals.</P>

This includes an additional £100,000 for the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork to support its work for the development of a national parasuicide register. The remaining funding has been allocated to health boards to further progress the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the national task force on suicide. These measures will include the recruitment of additional staff, the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on suicide. Central to the report was the provision of a national suicide prevention strategy which is now in place. The key components of the strategy are: the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups; provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations; research into suicide prevention.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking <Col N="1377" /> initiatives. The current anti-smoking campaign Break the Habit for Good emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. This campaign was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Because it is accepted that addiction, for the majority of smokers, begins before their adult years, an additional element of this campaign was developed last year to target female teenagers. The simple message of this element of the campaign is that smokers are less attractive and it uses a range of anti-cosmetics presented by a character called NICO who highlights the unappealing aspects of smoking. The recent burst of the Break the Habit for Good campaign, including NICO, ran in January, using all the appropriate media of communications to reach the target audiences such as television, radio, print, outdoor advertising as well as in-school advertising. NICO is a specific smoking cessation initiative targeting teenage females and hence future generations of mothers.</P>

      <P>The main source of advice to my Department on immunisation issues is the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary childhood immunisation pro<Col N="1378" /> gramme provides for the immunisation of children under two years of age against a number of serious infectious diseases. The present arrangements were introduced in 1995 and involve general practitioners entering into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of the programme. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. Operational responsibility for the primary childhood immunisation programme lies with the individual health boards, which have appropriate regional and local management structures in place to manage the delivery of the immunisation programme. My Department also monitors the operation of the programme nationally.</P>
    <P>The most recent immunisation uptake rates available from the National Disease Surveillance Centre for DTaP, Hib, Polio and MMR vaccines for the period 1 January-30 September, 2000 are as follows:</P>

    <P>The meningococcal C immunisation programme commenced in October, 2000. Phase 1 of the programme is targeting those at greatest risk, that is, children under five years and young persons aged 15 to 18 years. While it is as yet too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved in relation to the meningococcal C vaccine, preliminary indications are that uptake is generally good. It would appear, however, that uptake in the third level population is not satisfactory and new initiatives to target this group are currently under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to MMR immunisation, the health boards intensified their MMR immunisation programmes following the measles outbreak &ndash; over 1,500 cases &ndash; which occurred in 2000. Among the efforts made in this regard were: the identification and follow-up of unimmunised children; the targeting of &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; and vulnerable groups; requesting general practitioners to make special efforts to promote this vaccine to parents; contacting parents, schools and pre-schools to emphasise the importance of this vaccination; national and local media awareness campaigns on MMR vaccination.</P>
    <P>There is some public concern about vaccine safety and this is felt to be a significant factor in the unsatisfactory uptake. All of the expert advice available to my Department indicates that the vaccines used in the primary childhood immunisation programme and vaccines generally used in this country, are safe and effective. There is no evidence of a causal relationship between the vaccines and the subsequent development of such conditions as chronic inflammatory bowel dis<Col N="1379" /> ease, autism or brain damage. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue. My Department will continue to monitor the situation in relation to these issues at both national and international level.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent problem involving Medeva oral polio vaccine used in Ireland which contained human serum albumin produced from a plasma pool, where one of the donors has recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease &ndash; vCJD &ndash;  I arranged, on receipt of the information relating to this vaccine from the IMB, to obtain expert advice from both national and international experts in the field who advised on a wide range of aspects relating to this issue. Their advice indicated that the potential risk, if any, to recipients is essentially non-existent.</P>
    <P>Primary immunisation uptake still falls short of the target. Special efforts are being made in the current year by the health boards to achieve the national target of 95% which is required to achieve herd immunity. The health boards are in the process of developing strategies to address the uptake problems on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards are currently establishing a national immunisation steering committee which will address a wide range of issues relating to immunisation including the primary childhood immunisation programme. These issues will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, development of new mechanisms to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice. While membership of the committee has not yet been finalised, it will include representatives from all groups involved in the programme, including parents. The committee will, as part of its role, establish a coalition of interests in relation to vaccination issues.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to immunise their children. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable investment has taken place in the Cork centre. My Department made available capital grants of more than £500,000 to complete the following works: a new components processing laboratory; a new product storage area; an upgrade of the donor clinic and new office accommodation. Furthermore, the board of the IBTS, at its meeting in January, approved a draft planning brief for a new transfusion centre in Cork for submission to my Department. My Department will reply to this request shortly with a view to providing a new state of the art facility as a matter of priority. A new IT system will be operational shortly, which is the world leader in systems for transfusion centres. The staff of the Cork centre have taken the lead role in the implementation of this key project. Additional IT and quality assurance staff have been appointed. A second consultant haematology post has been approved, and funding has been made available for this appointment.</P>
      <P>On 5 February 2001, I announced the issue of A Guideline for the Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients which has been produced by the national blood users group. The membership of this group, established by my predecessor, comprises blood user experts from hospitals nationally. The guideline states that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to donated blood should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss. My Department is currently making this guideline available to all hospitals, general practitioners and medical schools. A special board meeting of the IBTS is scheduled for 28 February 2001 to consider further strategies to address the concerns of the possible transmission of variant CJD &ndash; vCJD &ndash; by blood transfusion. These strategies include: deferral of some donors; replacement of products currently manufactured by the IBTS, including red cells, by products sourced in BSE-free countries; and optimal use of blood components. These developments will have major repercussions for the core business of the IBTS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the meeting with representatives of the Southern Health Board, to which the Deputy has referred, I have also met other groups involved in the health services and listened carefully to their views. The IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, management and the entire staff of the <Col N="1381" /> organisation at all levels. There is a responsibility on all concerned to resolve the difficulties which exist between the Cork centre of the IBTS and its national headquarters to ensure a truly national service and to progress with its core business of developing best transfusion practice for the future. Recent public disagreements between the IBTS and the Southern Health Board are not conducive to the effective co-operation and partnership between complementary organisations which is to be expected and which prevails generally in the health system. This is all the more regrettable at present when the energies of the IBTS and hospitals generally should be focused on developing best transfusion practice, including important strategies to address the possible risk of the transmission of the vCJD by blood transfusion. I understand that the board, at its meeting in January, decided to engage external human resource expertise to assist in achieving a resolution of current problems and establish an improved platform on which to move forward. I welcome this initiative and would urge staff to fully engage in this process.</P>

      <P>The budget announcement to give automatic medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 years or over from 1 July 2001 is consistent with the Government's overall approach to enhancing the position of the elderly in Irish society. The measure is also a logical extension of the three-year doubling of the medical card income limits for that age category, the final phase of which will be effective from 1 March this year.</P>
      <P>The Department is concerned to ensure that the budget initiative will be progressed in a timely, effective and agreed manner and, accordingly, has issued an invitation to the Irish Medical Organisation to discuss the matter fully.</P>

      <P>This system allowed for the introduction of a central authorisation system where authorisations are granted by the European Commission. It also allowed for the granting of authorisations nationally on a decentralised basis.</P>

      <Col N="1383" /> Within six years of the entry into force of the above system, the Commission undertook to publish a general report on the experience acquired as a result of the operation of the new regulatory procedures for medicinal products introduced in 1995. For this purpose consultants were commissioned by the European Commission to carry out an assessment of the procedures and to report back to the Commission on the matter. The report is now under examination by the European Commission and may result in further Community legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>The national alcohol policy was published by my Department in September 1996. It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multi-sectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place. The most significant of these are as follows. First, the national alcohol surveillance project was established to monitor the implementation of the national alcohol policy and second, the health promotion unit of my Department commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition (SLAN) and Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC). They provide a profile of health-related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first report was published in 1999. A follow-up survey is being conducted. This will provide useful comparative figures. Third, research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected later this year. This research will inform future policy in this area. Fourth, children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called Walk Tall. The programme was initially developed for the designated drug task force areas. However, the programme was extended nationwide as part of the social personal and health education curriculum which came on-stream in primary schools in September. The programme was developed <Col N="1384" /> and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the health boards and of course the teachers. Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme &ndash; SAPP &ndash; called On My Own Two Feet, a life-skills approach within the broad concept of the health promoting school. The programme is also part of the social, personal and health education curriculum in post-primary schools. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse. Fifth, a training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serving of alcohol (RSA) has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those who are under age and those who are already intoxicated. Sixth, a new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers has just been launched. This campaign adopts a non-didactic approach, emphasising the choices open to young people and promoting a healthier lifestyle. The alcohol awareness campaign carries the slogan Less Is More &ndash; It's your Choice. It promotes alternative activities to drinking and encourages people to examine their whole life-style. The messages of the campaign will be communicated through media reporting, local community initiatives, youth organisations, and the highlighting of best practice examples of how to tackle the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>An important element of the campaign was the development of a dedicated website, www.cool-choices.ie. The site provides factual information for young people on alcohol, myths about drinking, and facts and tips for teenagers. There is a particular focus on binge drinking and its consequences for health, relationships, life options and opportunities. Nationwide activities and initiatives will be signposted on the site and there will be links to other websites.</P>
    <P>As part of the Less is More campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar recently which was attended by over 100 stakeholders &ndash; health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and the Garda. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues, and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the campaign will be carried out to ascertain its impact. The results of this <Col N="1385" /> research will inform the future direction of the campaign.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a review of bed capacity has been initiated in both the acute and non-acute settings, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues last year, as part of the Estimates discussions for 2001, and identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties. I am pleased to say that funding of £32 million has been approved on foot of phase 1 of the review to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period.</P>

      <P>Response times are an important measure of the operational efficiency of the ambulance service and are monitored on an ongoing basis by the individual health boards. Response times vary in each health board area, depending on the geographical location of the ambulance centre in relation to the call out location.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that we have meaningful performance targets for the ambulance service and I feel that a combination of good clinical audit and response times offers the best way forward. Good progress has been made in this area with the introduction of the national patient report form and work is currently well under way on the development of standard operating procedures. The development of clinically based response times is a complex area and the views of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which I recently established, will be critical in developing a suitable system for use here.</P>
      <P>Considerable resources have been provided by my Department for the extension of 24 hour &ldquo;on duty&rdquo; cover in ambulance stations and two-man crewing on all ambulances. These are important factors in improving response times and are a high priority for further investment in the future.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable (£70, £95, £120) in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. However, it is the intention to increase the rates by 25% to £90, £120 and £150 from 1 April next.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>Studies of hepatitis C infection in Ireland show similar infection rates of hepatitis C among injecting drug users as those reported by the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction, which noted in its annual report for 2000 that the prevalence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users in Europe is between 50% and 90%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent Irish studies, in 1999 and 2000, have shown infection rates between 52.1% and 89% in the injecting drug population. The rate of infection is related to the period of time a person has been injecting drugs. It is believed that the natural progression of this disease is that 30% of <Col N="1389" /> patients will develop liver cirrhosis in thirty years. The rate of progression to cirrhosis is related to continued illicit drug use, alcohol co-abuse and co-infection with hepatitis A, B or HIV. There is currently no vaccine against hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The provision of treatment for injecting drug misusers in the ERHA region is a matter for individual area health boards. I understand from the ERHA that drug treatment centres in the region have a policy of offering testing for HIV, hepatitis A, B and C to all patients who present for treatment of their addiction. All are encouraged to avail themselves of these tests. Patients who test positive for antibodies to hepatitis C have a confirmatory test &ndash; PCR. Clinical decisions are made based on laboratory tests, assessment of liver function and general assessment of clients before referral to a gastroenterologist for specialised treatment.</P>
    <P>Ideally all patients who are hepatitis C positive should receive treatment. The current treatment available has many side effects, one of which is to give the impression to the patient that she or he is withdrawing from heroin. For this reason, because of the potential to destabilise the patient in recovery, treatment is offered by the hepatologist primarily to those who are opiate stable over between six and 12 months.</P>
    <P>Referral procedures are being redefined so that the maximum number of persons who are positive for hepatitis C and for whom specialised intervention will be beneficial are offered such interventions. The three area health boards in the eastern region are in the process of recruiting hepatitis C co-ordinators to speed up the development of these protocols and to ensure that the maximum number who might benefit from treatment are offered it.</P>

      <Quest>the action he took in agreeing the 2001 service plan with the Eastern Regional Health Authority in respect of improving the inefficiencies in hip replacements; if he will make inquiries as to the reason so few patients have moved off this particular list in recent months, such as the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will take this matter up with the health board as a matter of urgency.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001 following the significant success experienced in this area last year. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
      <P>The management of waiting lists and waiting times for elective surgery have been identified as priorities for the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the authority's service plan for 2001. The authority has been given an initial allocation of £13 million in 2001 to deal with waiting list target specialties, including hip replacements. Waiting list figures for St. Mary's Hospital, Cappagh, at 30 September 2000 show a decrease of more than 50% since 31 December 1999. This reduction is substantial and while validation must be taken into consideration, the reduction reflects the significant investment and continuing efforts in the management of waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Responsibility for the provision of health services to persons living in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the individual matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to her directly.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the additional funding made available for the payment of arrears due in respect of the implementation of article 8.2 of the nursing home subvention regulations which allows for the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A once off sum of £950,000 was included in the board's letter of determination for 1998, to meet, <Col N="1392" /><i>inter ali</i>a, the cost of arrears payment. I am advised by the Mid-Western Health Board that, to date, £142,000 has been paid in respect of arrears to 154 subvention recipients. Payments have not as yet been made on behalf of former recipients now deceased. However, I understand that staff will be dedicated to this purpose with effect from Monday, 26 February 2001.</P>
    <P>The board estimates that a further 170 cases are still entitled to payment and the amount involved for refund to be in the region of £163,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A reply to these representations has now issued. However, I regret the delay in responding to the Deputy's representations.</P>
      <P>Designations under the urban renewal scheme were based on integrated area plans &ndash; IAPs &ndash; submitted by local authorities, and were in line with recommendations made by the independent expert advisory panel on urban renewal which was established to assess all the plans submitted. The property referred to in this case was recommended for commercial and residential incentives in the IAP submitted by Kildare County Council, and these recommendations were agreed with by the expert panel. The qualifying periods for these incentives run from 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2002 &ndash; commercial; and 1 March 1999 to 31 December 2002 &ndash; residential.</P>
      <P>For tax purposes, an hotel is defined as an industrial premises. Consequently, the commercial incentives available under the 1999 urban renewal scheme cannot apply to hotel use. When the integrated area plans were being prepared, local authorities were notified of the range of commercial and industrial incentives for which EU approval had been sought. Incentives sought for hotels related to double rent allowance and rates remission &ndash; subject to no capital allowance being claimed for that premises. The urban renewal scheme did not provide for capital allowances for hotels, as an accelerated capital allowance system for hotels is provided for in general tax legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> Subsequently, approval for the double rent relief and rates remission was not forthcoming from the EU as the EU Commission deemed these reliefs to be operating aids and thus not allowable under EU law. As a result, there is no tax relief available under the 1999 urban renewal scheme for construction or refurbishment of premises for hotel use.</P>

Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources, including the local government fund and other State grants, rates, fees and charges.</P>

      <P>When I assumed office, the allocation for the scheme was a little over £4 million. In recognition of the valuable work which is being done, I increased this provision to £5 million in 1998 and £6 million in 1999. I have continued to maintain funding for the scheme at a high level, with £8 million being provided in 2000 and I am further increasing this allocation to £8.658 million this year. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the need to assess the value of the various local initiatives in order to apply the most effective approach consistently across all health boards. I have put in place arrangements in my Department to follow up on this and other recommendations in the report.</P>

      <P>Amber flashing lights are permitted on Customs and Excise patrol vehicles, breakdown vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and on certain other utilities' vehicles in use at the scene of operations.

      <P>My Department provides grants for local authorities and the National Roads Authority for a range of infrastructural programmes. The needs of all sectors of <Col N="1404" /> the economy, including tourism, are taken into account in this context.</P>
      <P>Aspects of the following programmes, administered centrally by my Department, have a more specific tourism related focus. Over £323 million is being provided for expenditure on non-national roads in 2001. The improvements to which this expenditure will give rise will benefit road users generally.</P>
      <P>Each autumn, my Department seeks applications from local authorities for projects to be funded under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme. Various categories of works are eligible under this scheme and one such category is the improvement of designated tourist routes, roads, including scenic routes, within tourism areas and roads providing access to tourism areas. In 2001 £53.6 million has been allocated to local authorities under this overall grant category of which £16.25 million, or about 30% of the available funding, relates to tourism projects.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for a continuation of investment in urban and village renewal for the next seven years. The aim of the urban and village renewal measure is to upgrade city, town and village locations to make them more attractive places in which to live and work, to encourage social and economic development and to facilitate and support the development of tourism and tourism related activity. Over the seven year period of the plan investment of £103 million will be made in urban and village renewal projects.</P>
      <P>My Department organises and provides financial support for a number of national and inter-national competitions designed to encourage local communities to maintain and improve the physical, environmental and cultural fabric of the areas in which they live. The competitions are Tidy Towns, Ireland's Best Kept Town, a North-South competition attracting the most successful entrants in the Tidy Towns competition and Northern Ireland's Best Kept Town competition, <i>Entente Florale, </i>a competition established by an international European committee which promotes the planted environment in European towns and villages.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available from my Department specifically for the purpose of insulating houses. However, many effective measures to improve energy efficiency in houses can be achieved at negative or zero equivalent annual cost to the householder. The national climate change strategy, recently adopted by the Government, provides for intensification of educational and awareness programmes being undertaken by the Irish Energy Centre to promote these options and to fill the existing information gap for consumers.</P>
      <P>Since 1976, all new local authority housing has been built with wall cavity, attic and floor insulation. The standards of insulation required have been progressively improved in 1982, 1991 and, most recently, following the 1997 revision of the building regulations.</P>
      <P>My Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and redeveloping their housing stock through the remedial works scheme and funding for regeneration and redevelopment projects. Works under the remedial works scheme must comply with the building regulations. The extent of works carried out to dwellings varies from project to project. Where an extensive programme of refurbishment works is carried out, measures are taken to improve thermal insulation in accordance with the building regulations. Some 14,500 dwellings have been refurbished since the inception of the scheme.</P>

In addition, under section 111(7) of the 2000 Act, An Bord Pleanála is required to keep a written record of all its decisions, including the names of the board members present and the number voting for and against a decision. Regulations are being prepared by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act, including these provisions, into force.

      <Quest>the typical cost of a new house in Dublin in 1990 and 2000; if he will break down those costs into land, materials and other costs, including labour; and if he will make a statement on the rise in the price of land over the period.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average price of a new house in Dublin in 1990 was £63,595. The average price for the year 2000 is not yet available, but the average price for the third quarter of 2000 was £173,739. <Col N="1407" /> These figures are based on returns from mortgage lending institutions and the breakdown into the cost of land, materials, or labour is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>An indication of changes in the cost of house building may be obtained from the national house building cost index. This index relates solely to standard wages set by the national joint industrial council for the construction industry and average market prices for construction materials and does not include items such as development land prices, planning and development levies, planning fees, legal fees, marketing costs or profits which would be reflected in house prices. This index is published in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have information on the price of land, but it is generally accepted that demand for residential building land is derived from the demand for housing, not the other way round. The first Bacon report, An Economic Analysis of Recent House Price Developments (April 1998), supports this analysis and states that the rising land costs may reflect the relatively inelastic supply of serviced developmental land at sought after locations.</P>
      <P>The stock of serviced residential building land is encouraging and is set to improve significantly going forward with approximately 4,500 acres of zoned serviced land in Dublin city and county which could provide over 67,000 housing units, over six times current annual housing output.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to increase the availability of land for housing. In addition to increased investment in the water and sewerage investment programme, the serviced land initiative has been expanded and will service an estimated 167,000 sites, of which some 28,000 sites have been serviced to date, and almost 90,000 sites are expected to be serviced by the end of this year. Furthermore, a number of strategic development zones to fast-track planning and development of key residential sites will be designated by Government order shortly.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on residential density, formally issued by my Department in September 1999, are being reflected in local authority development plans to ensure the potential of available land is being utilised as effectively as possible, and a number of high density schemes have been approved in Dublin. Major local area plans have also been adopted in Dublin during 2000, including Stepaside with a potential for 4,800 housing units, Ballycullen-Stocking Lane, 2,300 units, Lusk, 2,300 units, Diswellstown-Porterstown, 5,600 units, Pelletstown, 4,000 units, and the North Fringe, 7,000 units.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department and bodies under the aegis of my Department are concerned there are a number of schemes and ways whereby assistance may be made available for community type facilities.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, amenity areas, including community and child care facilities, specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for individual local authorities in the first instance. However, facilities of this kind, related to the size and nature of individual schemes, are funded as part of the overall cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations. The social housing design guidelines issued by my Department contain guidance for local authorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new provision of £5 million is available from my Department in 2001 to enable local authorities to meet the capital costs of providing child care facilities in new and existing local authority housing estates and other social housing projects. There may be suitable opportunities to link the provision of such facilities with the provision of other community facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the regional operational programmes, 2000 to 2006, funding will be provided by my Department for local authorities to implement a wide range of urban and village renewal projects, including, where appropriate, the provision of community facilities. The operational programme has been approved by the European Commission and allocations under the programme will be notified to local authorities shortly. In addition, under the Peace II operational programme, 2000 to 2004, funding will be made available by my Department to county council-led task forces in the six Border counties for locally based regeneration, including, where appropriate, assistance towards the provision of community facilities. This operational programme has been submitted to the Commission for approval and a decision is awaited.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's voluntary housing schemes, a grant of £3,500 per unit of accommodation being provided in a project is generally payable towards the cost of the provision of communal facilities in the project.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in this year's budget.

      <Quest>his views on the anomaly in payments to the mothers of twins vis-à -vis those to mothers of other multiple births.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out the position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births on a number of occasions to this House in the recent past. Briefly, the position is that prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at twice the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> I do not accept that the current arrangements represent an anomaly. The payment of child benefit at 150% of the normal rate in the case of twins and double the normal rate in the case of triplets, gives recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them. The cost of providing for double child benefit payment for twins is estimated at some £10.2 million in a full year, based on the improved rates recently announced in budget 2001.</P>

      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, formerly the National Social Service Board, and the Social Welfare Tribunal. Apart from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Social Welfare Tribunal none of the other bodies deals with matters which were once the responsibility of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986. The main functions of the agency are to advise the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty. Before the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency, these functions were part of the remit of my Department. The allocation for the agency for 2001 is £3,325,000.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body set up in 1982 under the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1982, to deal with cases where entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute. The tribunal is an independent agency. Although the tribunal was established under social welfare legislation, the issues considered essentially relate to industrial relations rather than social welfare. Where a person feels that he or she has been unreasonably deprived of employment because his or her employer refused or failed to follow the negotiating machinery available for settling disputes, he or she may apply to the tribunal for an adjudication on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1982, a deciding officer or an appeals <Col N="1411" /> officer decided on the issue of whether a trade dispute existed for the purposes of an employee's claim to unemployment benefit or assistance. This decision could be appealed to an appeals officer whose decision was final.</P>
    <P>The 1982 (No. 2) Act provided that where the decision was to disallow benefit-assistance, it would be open to the workers, if they felt aggrieved, to have their case referred to the Social Welfare Tribunal. The allocation for the tribunal for 2001 is £6,000.</P>

      <P>Last December's record social welfare budget allocation of £850 million provided for significant improvements for people with disabilities, including a £10 per week increase for people with disabilities aged 66 years and over; an £8 per week increase for people with disabilities aged under 66 years; increases to be paid four weeks earlier than last year, from April 2001; fuel allowance to be extended by three extra weeks, from first week in October to late April; additional £6 per week living alone allowance to be paid to recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployability supplement and blind person's pension from April 2001; full rate disability allowance to be paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment, from April 2001, weekly increases of between £35 and £46; current exemption of income, up to £150,000, from the sale of a pensioner's residence to be extended to people getting disability allowance and blind person's pension from April 2001; access to back to education allowance for all people with disabilities following completion of a community employment scheme; and £1 million extra for Comhairle information service.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to make substantial progress over the period to 2003 towards a target rate of £100 per week for the lowest social welfare rates. The improvements provided in the recent budget are fully in line with this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as provided for in the PPF, a working group, which includes representatives of the various social partners, has been established to examine the range of complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of adult and child social welfare payments.

      <P>Family friendly workplace day on 1 March 2001 is an initiative of the national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The purpose of the day is to promote the implementation of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise. Plans include a media campaign promoting information about family friendly policies and practices, widespread dissemination to employers, workplaces and workers representatives of posters and information brochures; and the launch of a website providing useful infor<Col N="1413" /> mation about the options available and how they might be adapted to suit different employments.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service has led the way in introducing family friendly policies to the workplace. My Department, as one of the largest employers in the Civil Service with some 4,500 staff has been very supportive in implementing various initiatives introduced in recent years. In addition to statutory entitlements such as maternity, adoptive and parental leave, schemes available to staff in my Department to assist them in reconciling their work and family responsibilities include flexitime, job-sharing, career breaks, special leave for domestic purposes and term time leave. My Department was the first area of the Civil Service to pilot term time working, which is intended primarily as an additional facility to assist staff with young children to combine work and family responsibilities by enabling them to take up to three months leave during the summer school holiday period. While the leave is unpaid, special salary arrangements are in place so that staff members can spread the cost of availing of term time leave over a longer period. While the granting of term time summer leave is subject to the needs of the work, this year some 214 out of 227 applications have been approved in the Department. The scheme is now in place to be made available annually, with a review due in three years.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the scope of existing arrangements to assist Civil Service employees with family responsibilities will be extended further by the introduction of work-sharing later this year and by Government initiatives announced in the budget to support the provision of crèche facilities. The availability of many of these schemes to staff is dependent on the circumstances in individual sections of the Department and the need to ensure the service being provided for the public can continue to be delivered.</P>
      <P>On family friendly day on 1 March it is planned to circulate a summary of the family friendly schemes available and to encourage staff with family responsibilities to seek information about the options available to them to better balance their work and family commitments. Further initiatives to follow up the day are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Government families first approach to the development of policies and services, my Department is a keen and active contributor to the work of the national framework committee. Recently published research, Balancing Work and Family Life &ndash; the Role of Flexible Working Arrangements, by Peter C. Humphreys, Síle Fleming and Orla O'Donnell which was undertaken as part of the families research programme in my Department is helping to inform the deliberations of the committee. I fully support the work of the social partners in their important task to promote a more family friendly work-place. I will address this important issue at the biennial meeting of the Committee of Ministers <Col N="1414" /> with family responsibilities of the Council of Europe in June 2001 which is to consider the theme, Reconciling Work and Family Life.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's scheme of supports for community development and family support groups, once-off grants may be made to help voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas. Under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, grants may be made for renovation or acquisition of premises, purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects.</P>
      <P>Shandon-North Cathedral community association applied to my Department for funding, under last year's scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, towards renovation costs at the community centre. When assessing grant applications, my Department must take account of the overall level of applications received, the overall resources available to meet applications, and the degree to which individual applications meet the criteria laid down for funding under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The application received from Shandon-North Cathedral community association was assessed and not recommended for funding as it was considered that much of the services provided at the centre were more appropriate to the Department of Health and Children and the Southern Health Board which have responsibility for day care centres and health board offices and also to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has responsibility for child care facilities.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that, where previous applications from the group met the criteria for my Department's grant schemes, funding was allocated to the group. However, on that occasion, that is 2000, the application did not meet the criteria and therefore it was not possible to allocate funding.</P>
      <P>This year's scheme of grants to voluntary organisations was recently advertised. Should Shandon-North Cathedral community association apply for funding, their application will be considered in line with the criteria for the scheme, taking into account the overall demands to be met from available resources. The closing date for receipt of completed applications is 23 March 2001.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means-tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The estimate for the total numbers of carers in the State is drawn from the review of the carer's allowance, which was published by my Department in October 1998. The review noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers. While care groups have provided various estimates as to the number of carers, they have provided no supporting basis for this figure and it is not clear that all of these are full-time carers. The numbers suggested by them may be due to their definition of carer, whereby someone visiting or assisting an older person may consider themselves to be a carer.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the purpose of the carer's allowance is to support carers who are providing full-time care and attention for persons who are medically assessed as having such a serious disability that they require care for at least 12 months. Based on the research carried out in the review, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. I will arrange to have a copy of the review sent to the Deputy which sets out in greater detail the basis for the current estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide variety of sources, both national and <Col N="1416" /> international, were used to estimate this figure. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to the bibliography of the review of the carer's allowance for a complete list of sources.</P>

      <P>All of my Department's capital budget is for computer hardware. My Department has not funded any capital projects in the Waterford constituency which commenced in 2000. However, my Department supports locally based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion work in their communities through a range of long-term funding schemes under the community development support programmes, namely, the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme, the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. The once-off grants schemes are scheme of grants to voluntary organisations &ndash; these grants are made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects &ndash; community development education and training grants scheme &ndash; the purpose of this scheme is to fund local community and voluntary groups for funding and education initiatives, for example, programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees scheme of grants for locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>Grants are provided for programmes of self help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life. In addition, my Department funds the money advice and budgeting service which supports a number of centres countrywide which are involved in activities at local level aimed at tackling the problems of moneylending and overindebtedness. Details of all funding, including capital funding, made available under these various schemes-programmes have been made available to the Library each year to 1999 for the information of Members. Details of funding made available in 2000 are currently being finalised and will be made available to the Library in the coming weeks for the information of Members.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have secured a total of £36 million of Exchequer funding for ACCESS for the period 2001-2004. An initial assessment of the Millbank Project application for ACCESS funding has been completed and it has been determined that the project in question has met the broad criteria for eligibility. Accordingly, the application will now undergo a full evaluation along with other eligible applications and, on the basis of this, recommendations on the projects to be supported will be submitted to me for decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331, 332 and 337 together.</P>
      <P>Grantstown Wood and Lough Nature Reserve and Coolacurragh Nature Reserve, County Laois were both established as nature reserves in 1982 under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Both Grantstown Wood and Lough Nature Reserve and Coolacurragh Nature Reserve are proposed for designation as natural heritage areas. Neither of these sites, however, meet the strict scientific criteria necessary for inclusion as a special area of conservation under the European Habitats Directive as neither site conforms to habitat types listed for protection under this directive.</P>
      <P>I have made arrangements for ecological survey papers, statutory instruments designating both sites as nature reserves as well as the management requirements for these sites to be forwarded to the Deputies.</P>

Bord na Móna has sold or transferred bogs in its ownership proposed for SAC designation to Dúchas, other than some small areas where there are title problems. The bogs retained by Bord na Móna, other than the small areas I have already mentioned, are worked or degraded ecologically and fail to meet the criteria for designation. Accordingly, the percentage of bogs remaining in the ownership of Bord na Móna, which have been proposed for designation, is negligible, of the order of one quarter of 1%. It is a standard requirement of my <Col N="1429" /> Department that persons claiming compensation provide details of ownership prior to payment being made.</P>

No direct Government funding is provided to the film sector under this scheme. Since 1997, my Department has certified a total of 130 projects.

      <P>&ldquo;all persons shall be held equal before the law and that no person shall be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on any ground such as sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, colour, language, culture, religion, political or other opinion, national, social or ethnic origin, membership of the travelling community, property, birth or other status.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, has been amended by means of an order which was made on 8 February 2001. This amendment entitles a pregnant employee who commences maternity leave at any time on or after 8 March 2001 to maternity leave consisting of 18 consecutive weeks paid leave and eight consecutive weeks unpaid leave. A woman who would be due to commence additional unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 will be entitled to avail of eight weeks unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>In the case the Deputy refers to, as the woman finishes her maternity leave on 10 April, she will not be entitled to the increased entitlement of paid leave. However, if she does not commence unpaid maternity leave until on or after 8 March, she will be entitled to apply for eight weeks unpaid leave, instead of four weeks, if she so wishes.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify the position regarding the commencement date for the increased entitlements. The Minister for Finance announced on 6 December 2000 that the increased entitlements would apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided by the annual Social Welfare Bill apply from April or somewhat later.</P>
      <P>After the budget announcement, officials in my Department looked into the possibility of applying the maternity leave increases not only to women who commence maternity leave from early April but also to women who go on leave prior to that date. This issue was examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that an order made under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, would comply with that Act. The Attorney General advised me that it would not be possible to have the order extend the increased period of maternity leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements, that is, to employer by employee, of the parent Act and that any attempt to make the order retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge. The increases in maternity leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity benefit. They have major impact on employers in many ways, for example, the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected and, in some cases, contractual obligations in respect of pay<Col N="1432" /> ment. The effective dates of the increases, as set out in the order, take account of the notice requirements under the Act. The position, therefore, is that the need to comply with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, limited the extent to which the increases could be applied to persons already on maternity leave.</P>

    <P>I understand that a significant amount of those reported missing were reported to be suffering from depression or another medical condition which may have resulted in them having suicidal tendencies and that, sadly, last sightings of them were made near a river or the sea.

    <P>As regards six persons under 18 years of age who went missing in the 1990s, I am informed that investigations by the Gardaí have revealed that three of these people went missing as a result of a boating accident and that two were suffering from depression and were last seen near the sea. I understand that inquiries into all these disappearances are ongoing.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, Operation TRACE is currently re-investigating six of the missing female cases and new information is being processed and pursued. Operation TRACE continues to collate information received from both within An Garda Síochána and from the general public. This information is being added to the database and fully investigated. While progress is slow in painstaking investigations such as these ones, the Garda authorities consider that the operation is worthwhile and that it may yield positive results.</P>

The district officer for each area is responsible for the overall investigation for each missing person. This includes all searches. I understand that an investigation team is put in place which draws together any specialist resources the district officer decides are necessary to locate a missing person. In addition, every district has a specially trained search team which is familiar with the locality. At the division level, all investigations carried out in his/her area are co-ordinated by the chief superintendent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>To mark Family Friendly Workplace Day on 1 March 2001 my Department intends to highlight the family friendly schemes available to civil servants by distributing a reminder to the staff of my Department of the schemes available. The issue will also be placed on the agenda of the Department's Partnership Committee. In recognition of the &ldquo;long hours&rdquo; culture that exists in many areas throughout the Department, staff at all levels will be encouraged to go home on time on the day in question.</P>
      <P>The family friendly initiatives available in my Department are as follows:</P>
      <P>Flexitime &ndash; in this Department flexitime is available to the majority of officers up to the grade of higher executive officer. Officers on flexitime report for duty between 8.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. and may, subject to appropriate cover being available to the public, leave between 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Up to 11.5 hours credit may be worked up in a particular flexi period and taken as leave. Officers are obliged to work the core periods which in my Department are from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Job sharing &ndash; the jobsharing scheme allows staff to apply to work for half their normal hours for a period of not less than one year.</P>
      <P>Term time &ndash; this year for the first time in my Department, term time allows staff of my Department to take either ten or 13 weeks unpaid leave from June until the end of August. To be eligible the staff must have a child or children, up to 18 years of age, or be acting in <i>loco parentis </i>or be the primary carer for a person with a disability who needs care on a continuing or frequent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paternity leave &ndash; three days special leave with pay is available to fathers of children born on <Col N="1441" /> or after 1 January 2000. The leave may be taken up to four weeks after the birth of the child. In the case of adoption, the leave may be taken within four weeks of the date of placement.</P>
    <P>Career breaks &ndash; career breaks may be taken from between six months and five years. Staff must have completed two years probation before they can apply. A career break may be allowed for child care or domestic reasons, educational purposes or travel abroad. A person is not allowed take up paid employment within the State. A person may take a career break of up to three years for self-employment where there is no conflict of interest with their position in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Statutory entitlements such as maternity leave, adoptive leave and parental leave are also availed of by staff of my Department. In my capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have taken a number of initiatives in relation to family friendly policies.</P>
    <P>I amended the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 on 8 February 2001 to give effect to the budget announcement in relation to increased entitlements to maternity and adoptive leave. As a result of the amendments, entitlements to paid maternity and adoptive leave will be increased by four weeks with effect from 8 March 2001 and entitlements to unpaid maternity and adoptive leave will also be increased by four weeks with effect from that date. A father's entitlement to leave in the event of the death of the mother around the time of the birth or adoption has also been increased.</P>
    <P>The increases in maternity leave have come about as a result of the recommendations of a working group, set up by my Department to review and improve maternity protection legislation. The working group was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments and agencies. The report of the working group was presented to the social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on 25 January 2001. The working group's recommendations to increase maternity leave have been fast-tracked ahead of other recommendations to ensure that women could benefit from the increase as quickly as possible. Some of the recommendations of the working group will involve primary legislation which will be brought forward in due course.</P>
    <P>Adoptive leave was not within the remit of the working group, but the Government decided that, in the interests of equality, the increases in maternity leave recommended by the group would also be made applicable to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a requirement under the Parental Leave Act, 1998 and a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I will conduct a review of the operation of the Parental <Col N="1442" /> Leave Act, 1998, in 2001, in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>As part of an awareness raising campaign linked to Family Friendly Workplace Day, I plan to launch the report of the Working Group on the Review and Improvement of the Maternity Protection Legislation and to announce the commencement of the Review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 on 28 February 2001.</P>
    <P>I also plan to launch a research project by the Centre for Women's Studies, TCD which is being co-funded by the EU Commission and my Department. This research project will identify the key issues concerning the reconciliation of work and family roles, with particular emphasis on how to involve men in family and domestic activities. The research will include a focus on attitudes of men and women as workers and as parents and social policies designed to address these issues.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing funding of £4 million under the Equality for Women Measure of the Regional Operational Programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to develop family friendly projects in employment and the sharing of family responsibilities. Of this funding, £1.5 million has been allocated to support the work of the National Framework Committee which has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to develop family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>In the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, child care has been identified as a priority and £250 million comprising EU and Exchequer funds had been provided to my Department to develop child care provision. Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, which I launched in April 2000, supports are available to maintain current child care service provision, stimulate new child care services and ensure that all child care services are of the highest quality. Capital grants are available to community based and private providers, staffing grants are available to eligible community groups. In October 2000, additional funding of £40 million was made available to a number of Departments for further initiatives in the child care sector, £26.5 million of which was allocated to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to be pro-active in the implementation of future family friendly schemes introduced by the Government.</P>

      <P>The fees payable, under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 and the regulations made thereunder, to a solicitor assigned to a case in pursuance of a free legal aid certificate for essential visits to prisons and other <Col N="1444" /> custodial centres, other than Garda stations, is £73.71 with effect from 1 October 2000. In addition, my Department has implemented the Garda station legal advice scheme on 14 February 2001. This scheme provides that where a person is detained in a Garda station under certain legislation and the person's means are insufficient to enable him-her to pay for a consultation with a solicitor, such consultations will be paid for by the State. Persons who are in receipt of social welfare payments or persons whose earnings are less than £16,000 are eligible to receive assistance under the scheme. The scheme will operate on an administrative basis and will be reviewed after one year. The following fees are paid to solicitors for consultations under the scheme; (a) £73.71 per consultation in a Garda station between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday to Friday; (b) £100.23 per consultation in a Garda station between 7 p.m. and 9 a.m., Monday to Friday and on weekends and bank holidays; (c) £30 per telephone consultation with person detained in a Garda station; (d) travelling expenses are paid at the rate of 60p per mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>The licensing laws were the subject of considerable review by the Oireachtas committee which reported in June 1998. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated, took into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, including those recommendations which related to underage drinking. I also took into account submissions received from groups and members of the public following a consultation process. In the Act of 2000, I provided for considerable strengthening of those provisions which already exist in legislation of 1988 in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons. The defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in relation to the age of a person is no longer available in proceedings against the licensee, fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking have been increased and where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under age person is upheld, the licensed premises can be closed for a specified period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I officially launched the Age Card Scheme Awareness Campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities who have taken the following steps to pro<Col N="1445" /> mote the use of the age card: all Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters; non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters; a poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night-clubs and dance halls, etc; youth information centres-youth groups nationwide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support; Garda juvenile liaison officers-community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects, etc., highlighting the age card scheme; on-going liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochána; and new avenues of ensuring young people get the age card message are being explored. I am happy to say that to date, 23,000 age cards have been issued.</P>
    <P>Reform of our intoxicating liquor laws has not ended with the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 and the House will be aware that on 1 November 2000, I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws including an examination of the problems associated with underage drinking. However, while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme can help to curtail the problem of under age drinking, it cannot be viewed as the total solution. Dealing with the under age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of State agencies alone &ndash; parents, the drinks industry and the media too, must also play their part in helping to address the problem. We are all too well aware of the contributing role which excessive alcohol consumption plays in fuelling criminal and anti-social behaviour. Many of the attacks and assaults that happen on our streets, particularly late at night, and sadly even among people of a young age, have their origin in excessive alcohol consumption.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner, as well as formulating specific operational policing responses to the issue of violence on our streets, has brought together people to provide expert advice on the particular factors which appear to be at work in the manifest tendency towards serious violence in certain instances amongst young people. Expert advice of this kind &ndash; from psychologists, sociologists etc. must inform the type of police response required.</P>
    <P>As to the immediate policing response, the Garda Commissioner has indicated on a number of occasions that special emphasis is being placed by the Garda on the enforcement of the law in relation to street crimes. A national public order initiative known as Operation Oíche has been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. This project essentially involves the strategic use of extra gardaí to tackle <Col N="1446" /> the problem of violence amongst young people at or in the vicinity of certain discos and places where youngsters gather at night. The operation focuses on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, under age drinking, illicit drugs use and under age alcohol sales. Operation Oíche began as a pilot scheme in Dublin, and was extended to large towns and cities which, in the Garda view, require a similar targeted response.</P>
    <P>The question of research into the negative aspects of alcohol consumption and the measures that need to be undertaken to limit those effects can also be addressed outside the context of the licensing laws. They are, in effect, matters that fall to be addressed in the context of health promotion generally. In this context, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children announced the launch of the alcohol awareness campaign last week.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that certain tenants in Carrickmacross have experienced in relation to the purchase of the freehold interest in their properties. While the Circuit Court has, it appears, confirmed the tenants' right of purchase, I understand the decision of the Circuit Court is the subject of an appeal to the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I could not undertake to propose legislation the specific purpose of which would be to intervene between the rights of parties to the case. However, I shall keep the general principles of the subject matter under review having regard to the code of law relating to both landlords and tenants.</P>

      <P>Section 5(4) of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended, provides that an alien to whom leave to land has been refused may be <Col N="1447" /> detained in a designated place of detention. In accordance with section 5(5) of the order, that detention may only be until such time, being as soon as practicable, as he or she is removed from the State by or on behalf of the carrier in question. I am satisfied this power is an appropriate one and indispensable to the operation of normal border controls. Similar powers are available to the immigration authorities of other comparable jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the question of legislative change is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the drafting of a Carrier's Liability Bill, the essence of which is that carriers will be fined if they fail to carry out our basic checks to ensure that passengers are in possession of valid travel documents. Ireland is the only European Union country which does not currently have such legislation. One of the consequences of the introduction of that legislation should be a reduction in the percentage of immigrants arriving at the frontiers of the State with inadequate documentation thus reducing further the small percentage of immigration cases in which detention, as a means to facilitate return, would fall to be considered. The Deputy will also be aware that work is under way in my Depart<Col N="1448" /> ment on the preparation of an immigration and residence Bill which will replace existing aliens legislation and provide for all of the powers which will be available to immigration officers at points of entry to the State.</P>

    <P>In relation to deportations, the position is that from the beginning of November 1999 to 12 February 2001, 229 people have been deported.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of these were unsuccessful asylum applicants. Sixty-one were Polish, 75 were Romanian, and 38 were Czech nationals. There have been no Hungarians or Lithuanians deported to-date. It is general policy to deport persons to their country of origin except in one case where the Dublin Convention applied and a Romanian national was deported to another EU member state to have his asylum application processed there.</P>
    <P>In addition, as far as the Department is aware, 119 Poles, 54 Romanians, two Lithuanians, and 33 Czech nationals have left the State voluntarily in advance of a decision. In addition, 21 Romanians left the State before deportation orders which had issued in relation to them could be effected.</P>
    <P>Two Romanians have been granted leave to remain in the State other than on the basis of an Irish born child or marriage to an EU or Irish national during the period in question. The type of statistical information which is being collected at present in respect of the asylum process is currently under review in my Department in consultation with the offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible service is provided to the general public. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed nation wide, with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.</P>
      <P>With regard to the location referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current personnel strength, all ranks, of Muine Bheag Garda Station is six and that the station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., Monday to Saturday inclusive, and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday.</P>
      <P>When not open, PACB and call diversion systems are in operation and linked to the District Headquarters at Carlow Garda Station, which opens on a 24 hour basis.</P>
      <P>There is one marked patrol car permanently allocated to Muine Bheag Garda Station. Resources are augmented from within the division as required. The area is patrolled regularly by both the divisional traffic unit and the district detective branch.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> There is a long established community alert scheme in operation in the area, which concentrates particularly on elderly people living along in isolated areas. This scheme has supplied pendants and alarms to vulnerable members of the community. In addition, there is a business watch scheme in operation in the town of Bagenalstown and a new neighbourhood watch scheme is currently being established.</P>
    <P>Provisional figures for 1999 indicate a decrease in the numbers of indictable crimes reported and a decrease in the number of burglaries in the area &ndash; there were 16 burglaries in the period January to September 1999 as compared to 29 burglaries in 1998 as a whole. It should be noted that capital projects under the current programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has responsibility for the child care measure under the Regional Operational Programme of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which provides £250 million to invest in the development of child care service provision. The objectives of the programme are to increase the number of child care facilities, increase the number of child care places and improve the quality of child care services in Ireland. The funding measures include the following initiatives: capital grants for community groups and not-for-profit organisations for the establishment, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities; staffing grants to support staffing costs for community based child care facilities; capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, to build, renovate or upgrade child care facilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government decided to allocate a further £40 million over and above the £250 million allocation in the national development plan, to the development of child care. On 18 October 2000, I announced details of the Government's £40 million package which includes grant schemes towards the use of spare school classrooms for child care, the introduction of a national after-school child care programme and the first ever national initiative to help child minders.</P>
      <P>The proposals announced will address certain gaps in existing schemes and extend support to new areas of the child care sector and have been developed following an extensive round of consultations with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding measures are as follows: £9 million <Col N="1452" /> will be provided for capital grants for commercial providers of more than 20 child care places to allow providers to establish or improve child care facilities; £5 million to provide grants for community-based child care facilities which do not qualify for existing grants schemes; and £1 million for improved staffing grants for community-based projects. This will allow staffing grants of up to £80,000 to be allocated to these projects; £6.5 million for a national child minders initiative. This is the first national initiative targeted specifically at child minders and will involve start-up grants, information campaigns and other supports; £5 million for the provision of child care in local authority developments; and £5 million for improving quality through training and research. This will help ensure that people working in child care can progress in their careers and that the highest standards are achieved in child care.</P>
    <P>In terms of the funding available to local authority residents associations for the provision of crèches or pre-schools, resident associations could be eligible for capital or staffing support for community based not-for-profit groups under my Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006. Applications for funding under these measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. Application forms can be requested by contacting a dedicated lo-call line for such inquiries at 1890-20-90-30.</P>
    <P>Applications for funding will be assessed initially, on behalf of the Department, by Area Development Management Limited followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department. The assessment criteria for these measures include the extent to which the project will increase the number of child care places in disadvantaged areas, the quality and financial sustainability of the proposal as well as the capacity of the service provider to implement the project.</P>
    <P>Under the anti-inflationary package outlined above, local authorities will be allocated funding to address the issue of child care in new and existing local authority developments. I understand local authorities have been asked to assess the need for child care facilities in their area and to submit proposals to the Department of the Environment and Local Government within the coming weeks for funding in 2001. It should be noted that capital projects under the current programme, Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006, have one year in which to start and three years in which to complete a project. Within that period the start dates are at the discretion of the applicants.</P>

    <P>My Department also operates the local authority swimming pool programme, which was transferred from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in May 1998. No funding <Col N="1455" /> has been allocated to projects in Laois and Offaly since that transfer. An amount of £189,000 was allocated to Offaly County Council by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to refurbishment works at Birr, Clara and Edenderry pool prior to this date. A final payment of £9,000 in respect of these projects issued from this Department during 1998.</P>

      <P>I have secured in excess of £350 million for tourism measures under the national <Col N="1457" /> development plan. As tourism will not have a dedicated operational programme, these moneys will be spread across a number of them &ndash; Productive Sector Operational Programme, £150 million for tourism marketing, Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme, just over £100 million for tourism training, and regional operational programmes for the BMW and S &amp; E regions, £100 million for tourism product development.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the tourism marketing sub-programme will consist of two measures, a niche marketing measure and a destination marketing measure. Decisions as to the allocation of funding under this subprogramme will be a matter for Bord Fáilte or Tourism Ireland Limited as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Tourism training is dealt with under the Employment and Human Resources Operational Programme which will have three training measures to be implemented by CERT, including sectoral entry training for school leavers, sectoral entry training for persons who wish to re-enter the workforce and ongoing sectoral training for persons employed in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Support for tourism product development will be made available under the tourism measure within the two regional operational programmes. Bord Fáilte will be responsible for the implementation of three sub-measures, major attractions and clusters, special interest activities and tourism and the environment. Detailed operational guidelines for the tourism measure are being prepared by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department. The publication of these guidelines will be followed by a public call for tourism project proposals to be assessed by Bord Fáilte and approved under an independent product management board mechanism.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that two of the tourism product development sub-measures require State aids clearance by the European Commission and relevant negotiations have commenced.</P>

    <P>In addition, a grant of £50,000 was allocated to Fraher Field by the Minister for Finance in the 2001 budget.</P>
    <P>In order to eliminate the situation whereby sports capital grants allocated to clubs and organisations were not being drawn down, the sunset clause provision was introduced in 1998. The effect of this is that grants allocated since then have to be drawn down by a specific date, otherwise they are withdrawn. The time allowed is one year approximately for small projects and a year and a half approximately for larger projects.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions of the sports capital programme has been that the payment of a grant in relation to any project receiving total grant aid in excess of £39,000 is not made by my Department until a deed of trust has been executed. As the total charge in this case is £40,000, a deed of trust is required before the 1999 grant can be formally confirmed or payments made.</P>
      <P>A draft deed of trust was sent to the solicitor acting on behalf the club on 18 January 2001. When the deed has been executed on behalf of the club, it should be returned to the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as the deed has been signed by my Department and the searches on the trustees <Col N="1459" /> have been completed by the CSSO, arrangements will be made to pay the grant without delay.</P>

      <P>It is open to any group meeting these objectives to apply for funding under the programme, but it should be noted that the closing date for receipt of completed applications for the 2001 sports capital programme was 9 February 2001.</P>
      <P>I am informed by my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that the provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. In this context I would refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 866 of 31 January 2001.</P>

      <P>Schools receive funding from my Department to meet school running costs. My Department does not operate a national scheme for the provision of schools meals, supervised homework or school clothing. However, the eight to 15 years early school leavers initiative, which operated on a pilot basis from 1998 to 2000 and is now extended to 2002, involves 17 projects in 14 areas. Activities include learning support, homework support, meal provision, counselling and mentoring programmes. The annual funding for ESLI has increased to £6.5 million in 2001 and £7.1 million in 2002. These increases will support the expansion of ESLI into further areas of disadvantage and the inclusion of additional schools and communities. My Department is working on identifying new areas and schools for the expansion of this initiative. It also supported a number of after school support projects in 2000 under a fund for the development of educational responses to certain children at risk.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a number of schemes for primary schools aimed at tackling educational disadvantage. Resources allocated under these programmes are to be used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, operates schemes for the provision of school clothing and footwear for needy pupils, school meals and after school supports services. A working group comprising representatives from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and my Department is evaluating the school meals scheme. This group is examining the scope of alternative policy and organisational approaches which might result in a more efficient and effective operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999, the learning support teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lesser pupil-teacher ratios are entitled to apply to my Department for a learning support service where they can demonstrate a need for such support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the purchase of private psychological assessments, I am examining proposals prepared for me by the National Educational <Col N="1461" /> Psychological Service Agency. The agency has proposed a number of measures which should go a long way towards meeting the current demand for psychological assessments. I hope to be able to announce these measures in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 394 to 396, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the request by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, including for the reasons referred to by the Deputy. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that <Col N="1462" /> reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
    <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400, and allowances, and makes an annual <i>per capita </i>grant towards recurrent costs, including cleaning, of schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support.</P>
    <P>Regarding insurance cover on school property and against public liability, this is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita </i>grants may be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have shown my commitment by the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the standard <i>per capita </i>grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, <Col N="1463" /> thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 people participate annually in the vocational training opportunities scheme at an annual cost to the State of £32 million. The vocational training opportunities scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The funding referred to in the questions is the grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees for expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The rate of the grant is £15,000 per core group of 20 VTOS students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A train<Col N="1468" /> ing bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. An adult educational guidance service has been initiated on a pilot basis, and a new management structure has been developed for the programme.</P>
    <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>The reply of 6 February stated that the school already benefits from inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme. This is incorrect. Any inconvenience caused by the inclusion of this statement in the recent reply to the Deputy is regretted. While the school was considered for inclusion in the scheme in 1994, it did not rank sufficiently high at the time for inclusion.

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and arrangements will be <Col N="1470" /> made for the deployment of educational welfare officers by the board to supervise school attendance.</P>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's query regarding the specific arrangements for the Tallaght area, it is my intention that the new educational welfare service will, ultimately, cover the entire country. The number of welfare officers to be deployed in particular areas will be determined by the board having regard to the needs of the area. The service will be implemented on a phased basis, in line with a plan to be developed by the designate board. The priority in the initial stages will be on areas of disadvantage generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Pay scales for secretaries under this scheme, as for secretaries and caretakers employed in the comprehensive and community and VEC school sectors, are determined centrally. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard<i> per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita </i>grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have <Col N="1472" /> set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this month I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils over the three year period of the programme. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of a range of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension of the new programme, the school will receive supplementary grant aid of £6,782 in respect of the current school year towards providing additional educational sup-ports for the children concerned, and a similar amount in each of the next two years. It did not, however, rank sufficiently high in terms of the level of disadvantaged pupils to receive additional teaching posts under this phase of the programme.</P>
      <P>Primary schools receive <i>per capita </i>grant funding towards the running costs of the school from my Department. In general, the disbursement of these funds is a matter for the school management authority in line with priorities set by each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the funding needs identified by the Deputy may be met from the additional funding provided under the new programme. To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources, I have appointed a director of pro<Col N="1474" /> grammes to tackle disadvantage. The director will be assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage, the delivery of targeted supports and the disbursement of the additional funding. My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, operates a scheme for the provision of school clothing and footwear for needy pupils.</P>

Following its discussions with the university, the authority provided detailed advice to my Department at the end of January 2001 and my officials are currently considering this advice. The question of the level of ongoing funding for the project is being considered in this context. The Higher Education Authority allocated £150,000 in December 2000 to the project.</P>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of a director, the university has recently appointed a campus manager, who is charged with responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the outreach campus. Given the current stage of development, the university considers that it may be more appropriate to drive the project through the office of a campus manager while acknowledging that the long-term future and development of the project can best be conducted by a campus director.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by officials of my Department to finalise proposals for this project. I understand that 26 students have registered for the BA in local and community studies at the Kilkenny campus in the current academic year, bringing the number of students registered on the programme to 76 currently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
      <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Scoil Bhríde is one of the schools which has benefited under this phase of the scheme.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 432 together.</P>
      <P>There are two drug prevention programmes in schools. The programme in primary schools is entitled, Walk Tall, and the programme in post-primary schools, On My Own Two Feet. The drugs dealt with at primary level are alcohol and tobacco. At post-primary level there is a major focus on alcohol awareness in the second programme.</P>
      <P>The programme in primary schools had been introduced into 2,787 schools by the end of the year 2000. By the end of June of this year it is expected that it will have been introduced to 3,000 schools or 94% of all primary schools.</P>
      <P>Training was provided for primary school staffs by way of one day seminars and an optional three hours per week over nine weeks was also offered. The programme for post-primary schools was introduced into approximately 570 or 75% of post-primary schools and 1700 post-primary teachers did 50 hours training for that programme. This programme has now been subsumed into the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme. By the end of the year 2003 every post-primary school is expected to have SPHE as an integral part of its programme in junior cycle.</P>

      <P>In recent years two grants have issued to primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was called a library grant and was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each.</P>
      <P>A second grant issued to all primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of a specific application for grant aid towards the costs of books for their own library having been received from the school referred to by the Deputy. However the school received £1,000 in December 1998 and £1,686.30 in December 1999, under the terms of the above grant schemes, to assist it with the purchase of materials for its school library.</P>

      <P>The question of future educational provision for visually impaired girls of post primary age was among the issues addressed by the planning group established by my Department to consider proposals for the development of a national centre of excellence for the visually impaired.</P>
      <P>The planning group, which reported to me and the Minister for Health and Children in September 2000, has put forward a comprehensive range of proposals for the development of a national centre of excellence for the visually impaired at Drumcondra, Dublin. The national centre will deliver a comprehensive range of professional support services for the visually impaired from pre-school level to young adulthood. The services in question will be available to all pupils on the Drumcondra campus and on an outreach basis to students with visual impairment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The planning group has also put forward specific recommendations for the development at Drumcondra of a full range of educational support services for visually impaired girls of first and second level age.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring adequate educational support services are made available to all students with visual impairment. My commitment in this regard is reflected in the fact that I have secured additional funding of £500,000 in the current year to facilitate the appointment of additional staff at the existing schools for the visually impaired at Drumcondra. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group, including those relating to services for visually impaired girls of second level age, involve a range of complex issues which require very careful consideration. The proposals in question are being considered in my Department and I expect to make an announcement in relation to these matters in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-2001 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710, respectively. A postgraduate grantholder is also eligible to have his or her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
      <P>With regard to the level of maintenance grants, I have followed the practice of recent years and increased grant rates in line with increases in inflation. I have also increased the reckonable income limits, for purposes of the student support schemes in line with increases in the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October, I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance for eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further <Col N="1483" /> postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000-2001.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-2001 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed in the sub-mission, a copy of which has been supplied by the Deputy, that postgraduate students are an intrinsic part of the research infrastructure in Ireland, but do not accept that this Government has ignored its role in this country's prosperity. Increasing the number of people with higher degrees is an important national strategic objective. Apart from the general strategic objective of ensuring a vibrant pool of high quality postgraduates, the success of the substantial investment in our research capability is dependent on an adequate supply of high quality graduates.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-2001. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will be putting in place, within these fields of study, similar postgraduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes can include the awarding by the colleges of postgraduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The <i>per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to institution and field of study.</P>
    <P>Some 49 postgraduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the postgraduate research and development skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Report of the Commission on the Points System recommends that the points system be retained on the basis that it is well established, is broadly fair and transparent and is generally accepted by the public at large. Nonetheless, the report identified a number of weaknesses and drawbacks in the current system and makes recommendations on a wide range of issues including lifelong learning, access to third-level education for mature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities, entry to healthcare courses, and the leaving certificate grading and points system.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of repeating the leaving certificate, the Commission recommended that the points and basic entry requirements, with the exception of Irish in the NUI colleges, be attained in the same sitting of the leaving certificate. Having regard to the relevant statutory provisions, this recommendation along with others dealing with the admission arrangements applied by third level institutions, fall within the responsibility of third level institutions themselves. The Higher Education Authority has been requested to pursue these recommendations with the relevant institutions and I expect to receive a progress report in this regard shortly.</P>

The effect of these additional resources will be to provide enhanced services for children from disadvantaged areas. A director of programmes and support staff are being appointed to assist teachers in putting the scheme into practice.</P>
      <P>The new programme was widely welcomed as a major contribution to tackling educational disadvantage. Nevertheless, a number of teachers have expressed some reservations about the package in relation to additional responsibilities falling upon schools.</P>
      <P>My Department had discussions with the INTO and the other partners in education well in advance of the launch of the new programme. Further discussions are being arranged with the INTO and school management organisations to provide any clarifications required and to facilitate the implementation of the programme.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 266 of 13 February I outlined how the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science arises under statute for the regulation of industrial and reformatory schools and how that differs in the case of day schools. I did so in the context of the Government's decision in principle to establish a compensation scheme for people who suffered abuse while in residential care, a decision which does not extend to children who were pupils in day schools. Apart from this statement of the statutory role and responsibility of the Minister of the day, it is not appropriate for me to outline in any more detail legal advice which may be given to me on the matter. The issue of whether the Minister has a wider responsibility to children in ordinary schools and the nature of that responsibility, if it exists, are matters which are before the courts in a number of cases and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>I am aware from the national English reading surveys of fifth class pupils in primary <Col N="1488" /> schools that about 10% of these pupils have serious reading difficulties.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999 the remedial service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service. There are currently, 1480 remedial teachers working in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Shortcomings in children's reading competencies at the time of transfer to second level schools will limit their potential subject choice. For this reason my Department provides an English course at foundation level in the junior certificate in addition to the normal two levels. The junior certificate school programme is also available in schools for such pupils.</P>
      <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post. However, schools with enrolments below 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-2000 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education at second level will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the report of the expert group on teacher allocations which is expected to be available in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concern among school authorities with regard to poor attendance due to students working, often late at night, and the serious implications this has for their education; the steps he will take to deal with this growing problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about non-school attendance, caused by whatever reason. Due to the link between non-school attendance and early school leaving my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attend<Col N="1489" /> ance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    <P>The Act provides measures designed specifically with early school leavers in mind. Section 29 provides that a young person, in effect in most cases 16 and 17 year olds, may register with the National Educational Welfare Board if they leave school before their 18th birthday. The board will then, following consultation with the young person, parents and others, prepare a plan for the young person's continuing education and training. Once that is done the board will issue a certificate to the young person concerned. The section goes on to provide that an employer cannot employ a young person unless he or she is the holder of a valid certificate. An employer is also obliged to inform the board within a month after a young person has been employed. The Act provides significant penalties for employers who breach these provisions. The overall thrust of the provisions is to place meaningful restrictions on the process whereby young people who are encouraged by an immediate earning potential to leave education and training and take up often low-skill work. The provisions do not prevent young people taking up employment but seek to ensure that a balance is struck between their employment rights and their future educational, training and social needs. My Department is in the process of implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, precludes young people, between the ages of 16 and 18 and who are still at school, from working after 10 p.m. on any night when there is school the following day. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has recently recruited a number of additional inspectors to assist with the enforcement of this legislation.</P>
    <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. For that reason I believe that it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the 8-15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998&ndash; 1999 and 1999-2000. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    <P>The objective of preventing early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and in order to have a real chance of success the solution must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that school authorities experience difficulties in the area of substitution arising from in-service and examination work.</P>
      <P>Concerning in-service, problems arise at second level where there are no dedicated days available during which core training and development can be provided for teachers involved in curricular change, new and amended school programmes and other changes in schools. While every effort is made to keep the need for substitution to a minimum, there is no feasible alternative at present to providing such training and development during school time and in the majority of cases this necessitates substitution.</P>
      <P>Various solutions to this problem are under consideration in my Department on an ongoing basis, including the option of providing in-service activities as part of core training and development outside of normal school times. My Department will continue to try to find ways to minimise disruption in consultation with the interested parties.</P>
