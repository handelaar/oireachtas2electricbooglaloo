      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal relating to the late sitting agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take the opportunity this morning to congratulate the Taoiseach as Leader of Fianna Fáil on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the party. We decommissioned four years earlier&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;so in that sense, we are the senior party. We wish him well in the future <Col N="526" /> because from our perspective, politics would not be half as entertaining if anything were to happen to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to break up this Civil War love-in, although we would like to see its finality, if that is a possibility. On a more serious note, exactly 12 months ago to this day the House commenced the debate on the Labour Party's private Bill to ban corporate donations.</P>

      <P>The proposal before the House is the question of the late sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to that, Sir, on the grounds that the Labour Party's Bill has not been taken. It has been blocked by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Taoiseach has consistently failed to bring forward measures designed to deal with the ongoing outrage of the funding of political parties by corporate donations, as is evidenced daily in Dublin Castle. We are opposed to this Order of Business on the basis that, notwithstanding that the House has passed Second Stage of this legislation unopposed, it is being blocked by the Government. One can only conclude that the Government has no intention of making changes in the conditions for fighting elections until the general election is upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The late sitting affords more time to deal with issues but it seems there is foot-dragging on the part of the Government in relation to the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, which I expected to see this week &ndash; the month of June was mentioned yesterday. We are fitting in issues ahead of priority issues such as the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill. We should deal with it before we decide on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is the proper method to deal with those questions. I remind Deputy Quinn that this House has passed the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1997, and the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, the Prevention of Corruption Bill, 2000, is awaiting Committee Stage, the Standards in Public Office Bill is before the House, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill is awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad, the audit for allowances of parliamentary party leaders Bill will be initiated in the Seanad, the Local Government Bill, 2000, is resuming on Second Stage. We hope to see progress on the Lobbying Bill in this session. We are taking the Labour Party Bill on <Col N="527" /> whistleblowers. The Ethics in Public Office Act is working. We have made enormous progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>More progress has been made in the ethics programme in this Parliament than in any other Parliament in the world, and I know that Members are pleased with that progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> I thank Deputy Noonan both for his words of congratulation on the 75th anniversary of the founding of Fianna Fáil and for the spirit in which they were spoken. Our two parties have managed to keep political life going in this country over that period. I thank him for his acknowledgement of our 75th anniversary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal to guillotine a debate on the Report Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000. The Cabinet took the unprecedented step of going to Ballymascanlon on Monday to discuss in detail provisions to deal with what the Government admits is a crisis in the health services. It emerged from there with no resolution to this matter. There is a crisis in the health service. It requires full and open debate in this House and we are opposed to the guillotine at 1.30 p.m. We would accept this order if the debate is allowed to extend until 7.00 p.m. this evening.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that just 3% of domestic waste is recycled in Ireland and that an EU directive requires us to increase this to 50% in four years' time? Against that background, is he aware of the comment yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, that &ldquo;Recycling is getting only token attention from the Government and serious money will have to be put into it; we should have done it much earlier.&rdquo; I agree with the Minister of State. Will the Taoiseach agree that we should have done so much earlier, now that he is facing his fifth year in office, which is becoming the mantra of the Government? Given that the Government is now entering its fifth year in office, the crisis in the health service, traffic chaos in Dublin and the housing crisis should have been dealt with much earlier. If the Taoiseach is looking for an election slogan he should adopt that of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, &ldquo;We should have done it much earlier.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister with responsibility for local government has run out of the House. I can understand why because the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill will effectively strip local authorities and the communities they represent of any effective say on the location of incinerators. In light of the widespread concern throughout the country on this issue and the failure to implement a proper policy of recycling, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government will persist with this draconian measure which will put a further nail in the coffin of local democracy?</P>

I have no doubt he will continue to deal with the powers of local management. I would say to Deputies Quinn and Noonan that it is a pity local councillors did not take a lead in the past six months from what was said in the House. Their members did not support the local management policies on the ground which caused delays in many areas. The Minister will continue to pursue these policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has had four years in office to deal with a whole series of issues. I accept he made a series of announcements and promised to introduce legislation to deal with these issues but nothing has happened. I put it to the Taoiseach that we are obliged under an EU directive to bring recycling of waste up to 50% of all waste in four years' time and that nationally local authorities only recycle 3% of domestic waste, which is appalling. Will he talk to the Minister to try to get him to do something over the next few months? At present his record as Minister for the Environment and Local Government is absolutely appalling.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill is before the House. I hope a number of proposals, including proposals for this city, to deal with waste management will be up and running shortly. I believe these policies will be supported by the public. Many pilot projects which the Minister encouraged and which have been in operation for many years have worked extremely well. I agree there is a low percentage of recycling but the Minister's waste management strategy and policy, including the legislation, is making a difference.</P>

No doubt his brother will tell him there are more than 7,500 people on Dublin Corporation's housing waiting list. These people have no hope of purchasing a house.

      <P>The reality is, Sir, that today's property supplement is advertising for sale by public tender on 14 June a site of 14 acres which could provide approximately 350 separate dwellings of one kind or other, the estimated value of which is approximately £20 million. The Minister for Finance has a very large budget surplus but the local authority cannot acquire the land. Why will the Taoiseach not put his words where they can be effective and give this site to the local authorities to build badly needed houses for 7,500 people who have no hope of ever getting a house under this Government while land from which the money is not even needed is being thrown away?

Will he arrange for officials of his Department to have discussions with the Corporation to see if some of this land could be released to solve the appalling housing crisis in Dublin which, despite all the talk from the Minister, is getting worse? </P>

      <P>We will not stand in the way of the Minister on this but we are very unhappy that an announcement was made in the budget that this measure was something clearly indicated by <Col N="540" /> the Government a long time ago. We find it extraordinary that we are now in a situation where at the 11th hour on Report Stage the Minister comes into the House and includes something on Committee Stage and then proceeds to Report Stage on something which is not directly related to this Bill. It is an indication of the disarray and the lack of preparation that both he and his Department have shown in dealing with important issues in the area of health.</P>
      <P>When I was made aware that this was to be introduced today I was able to find in my records that I had asked the Minister some time ago whether it would require legislative change. A member of the medical profession had raised that query with me. The Department should have been well aware that legislative change was required to fulfil a commitment made in the budget. Yet this is being included at the very last minute under most unsatisfactory conditions. That is not the way this House should conduct its business of scrutinising legislation proposed by the Government and ensuring that legislation is of the highest standard and has gone through the required processes to ensure our laws are watertight and properly founded.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment to amend the long title of the Bill to take account of amendment No. 5. Amendment No. 5 allows for the automatic extension of the medical card scheme to everybody over the age of 70. In the budget 2001 package the Government made it clear that it intended to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over regardless of means, to come into effect on 1 July. The background to this measure rests in the overall Government commitment and decision to significantly improve eligibility for older people in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government from 1997 onwards committed the Government to review medical card eligibility for older people and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. The improvement which was introduced over a three year period began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70-79 and 80 years and over which were already higher than the normal guidelines increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of the process was implemented in March of 2000 followed by the implementation of the third stage in March 2001. That basically left about 30,000 over 70 year olds who were not in position to receive a medical card. It is in that context that the Government took the decision to extend it to everyone over 70. More than 1.15 million people <Col N="541" /> in the country have a medical card so 30,000 is not an enormous figure.</P>
    <P>I received legal advice several weeks ago that it would be better if we provided for this in legislation to avoid any potential challenge to the decision to extend medical card eligibility to over 70s. It is opportune and useful that this health amendment Bill provides an opportunity to facilitate such an amendment. It is important that we as a society show our commitment to the elderly and our appreciation for what the older generation has done to build this country. Elderly people have greater medical need than other age groups.</P>

      <P>I hope the learned Members of Fianna Fáil might let us do that. It was poor form that the Government did not have the legal framework in place when this was announced at the budget. It is embarrassing that it must amend the legislation. That should have been done before.</P>
      <P>What proposals has the Minister for the cases where wives are younger than their husbands? Will they be allowed medical cards with those over 70? It is wrong that the Minister brought this proposal without it being clarified. It is embarrassing for him to introduce the legislation now. Announcements should not be made like this. Since it came to office, the Government ran out the PR people's press releases and made statements after which it discovered that the legal framework was not in place. This announcement caused confusion that must be dealt with immediately. People to whom medical cards were promised must have them.</P>
      <P>I support this measure. Fine Gael proposes that it apply from 65 years up and I hoped that today the Minister would agree to that. We are the only European country that does not provide medical cards for pensioners and children. Every child, from birth to 18 years of age, should have one. I hope the Minister will do this now. In any event, it will happen soon when the new Government takes over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment. It is a tremendous decision by the Government to give medical cards as of right to everyone over 70 years of age. I am surprised the Minister believed he had to introduce legislation lest well paid professional groups challenged this socially just decision. It is appalling and laughable that doctors who are a well paid group pretend to have a social conscience and indicate that they will challenge this in the courts or will not implement it.</P>
      <P>Recently, a 92 year old constituent went to her doctor to ask him to accept her medical card. She had been a patient of his and his father's for 45 years. She was treated disgracefully by the doctor, who took the form, muttered something about the IMO, and threw it on his desk. His attitude was that she should come back in a few months time when his association reached an agreement with the Minister. I laugh at doctors pretending to have a social conscience while they treat the elderly like this and act as if they are being asked to do something for nothing. They get well paid for medical card patients and zealously guard their book from younger colleagues to stop them treating these patients. However, they prefer to have the elderly pay the £22 or £25 fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is marvellous that elderly people will have the medical card as of right. They put their shoulders to the wheel over many years. It is disgraceful to see doctors and the IMO mistreating them. The IMO may not tell doctors not to treat these patients but they are typically boorish in treating them. If doctors believe they deserve extra <Col N="543" /> money, then let them negotiate with the Minister. Dressing it up in the pretence of a social conscience or justice is nonsense. Like any group, doctors have a right to look for higher pay. However, elderly patients seeking to have their forms signed are not strangers but long-term paying private patients. I advised some to go to another doctor but people do not want to do that because they believe they have a relationship of trust with their doctors. The doctors' argument should be sorted out by their association and the Minister. Their way of treating and communicating with their patients is despicable. I hope it is sorted out quickly and that the IMO gets the message to its members to treat their clients, and prospective clients, with dignity and respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a great deal of hogwash from Fianna Fáil on this issue. We must set the record straight. The medical profession would be the first to welcome a scheme that provided free GP care not just for the over 70s, but for the under 70s when we are talking about our elderly population or, indeed, another part of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I had to listen to Deputy Ahern and now he is going to have to listen to me.</P>
      <P>The reality is that we are not talking about the elderly population but about a specific group within the elderly population who will be provided with medical cards. I for one welcome the provision of medical cards for any group, particularly people who are, generally speaking, more likely to be sick than younger people. I will not, however, go along with this kind of hypocrisy that is being presented here as if somehow the elderly and those most in need are being cared for because clearly what is being put forward here is a proposal which will ensure that those who are over 70 years, of whom there are very few left who do not have medical cards already, will have medical cards. The Minister was right in saying that it is quite a small proportion who do not have the protection of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about someone who is under 70 years, who is living on low income and who cannot afford to access their GP and we are certainly not talking about providing for families with young children, living in poverty and who cannot access a doctor when they need one. Recently, a cancer patient came to see me who could not afford to see her GP. A mother of two children, both of whom have eye problems, who cannot afford to access their GP came to see me. They are generous in their view and they understand that elderly people are entitled to have free GP care but they are also desperately anxious about themselves and about their children. Another woman with cancer asked me, in reference to the Abbotstown project, where will the <Col N="544" /> sons be if there are no mothers to look after them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has lost touch with the people. The fiasco at the Ballymascanlon Hotel only underlined the reality that this Government is out of touch if it thinks that there are elderly people who are now protected as a result of this proposed measure. We are talking about people who have made a contribution to this State and have built up the Celtic tiger economy but who have not reached 70 years, and may not reach 70 because they cannot access the care they need.</P>
    <P>A person brought to my attention that the medical card income guidelines effective from 1 January 2001 are £162 for a married couple aged between 66 and 69 years. This couple is entitled to an old age contributory pension of £183 which puts them £21 over the medical card limit. The limits set out show there is a more favourable balance towards people who are more elderly, but it is clear that there is still a disjuncture between social welfare payments for married couples of a certain age and access to the medical card.</P>
    <P>This area is crying out for reform. We need a new GMS contract. The arguments being put forward by medical professionals who, of course, have a self-interest &ndash; everyone understands that so why should anybody be surprised &ndash; are simply dismissed. The central issue in the argument being put forward on this is hardly about the self-interest of doctors, because we are not talking about a very big population anyway.</P>
    <P>I would like to convey a flavour of this to the Minister now that we are addressing this issue. I thought it would be addressed slightly lower down on the list of amendments, but let us address it now. An article in the medical press headed, &ldquo;Sense of injustice over medical card scheme permeates local practices&rdquo;, states that:</P>
    <P>The sense of injustice articulated by the IMO in relation to the decision by the Government to give free medical care to people aged 70 years and over on a non-means tested basis, has found echoes in general practice throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is particularly true in the North-Eastern Health Board [area] where healthcare is provided for some of the State's most marginalised rural communities in the counties of Monaghan, Cavan, Meath and Louth . . . Between them they span a broad socio-economic canvas. . . . But, regardless of the county, the local community make-up or whether or not the setting was rural or urban, every GP who proffered an opinion on this issue was full-square behind the IMO's assertion that the Government's move was unjust and flew in the face of social equality.</P>
    <P>If we are going to seek progress on providing the security and guarantee to people who are sick that money will not undermine their access to a doctor, then we have to get real about it. We do not go along with the political games that are being played in regard to this measure. I suspect <Col N="545" /> the Department of Health and Children and maybe even the Minister know quite well that this is not dealing with the real issues. There is an issue of social equity and about protecting the health of the public.</P>
    <P>One GP made a point about how people lose their medical cards and, increasingly, people are losing their medical cards because they are able to access employment. Dr. Peter Walhrab, a Kells GP, has seen his own GMS list decline by about 25% in just 18 months. In addition to the loss of income this involves, Dr. Walhrab has concerns about what this means for health care through general practice. He said:</P>
    <P>The people who lose their medical cards do not become high spending private patients. Their attendance drops off from approximately eight visits each year to zero visits. They simply disappear because they cannot afford the cost of either the visit or the medicines.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious comment and statement about the inequity that exists in general practice and in terms of primary care.</P>
    <P>This Government is ignoring it and is throwing out a sop to the over 70s and it is trying to paint a picture that somehow it is doing the generous thing and providing care for the elderly. It is providing medical cards for a certain number of elderly people who are excluded at the moment, even though over 70s have a much higher ceiling when it comes to GMS eligibility. That is all. It is not about dealing with the grave injustice that has been done to young people and young families on low incomes and to elderly people on low incomes; people who simply do not feel free, like practically all our European counterparts, to walk into their family doctor and say they are sick and need help and care. This is the party that delivered free secondary education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday the Taoiseach came out of the Ballymascanlon Hotel and tried to convince the nation that there was not a crisis in our health service. Tell that to that mother who is worried about her children and their eye condition. She is married to an alcoholic. They are over the income <Col N="546" /> limit, but she never gets to see the money. She owes the doctor £25 and she is afraid to go back to him, even though she is desperately worried about her children's eyesight, because of the money outstanding. One could say the doctor is to blame. I told her to go back to the doctor anyway.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about health reform, there are certain guarantees we as a nation can give to our people that we now give in this context to the over 70s who are outside the frame, while maintaining the drugs scheme with some contribution from those who can afford to pay. All our people, no matter what their circumstances, no matter how poor or how rich, no matter who they are married to or are dependent upon, should be guaranteed access to their family doctor. That is the concern being expressed, a concern which the Government is simply ignoring. To dismiss this as some kind of private gain is nonsensical. As far as anybody who has looked at this intelligently is concerned, the GMS contract will have to be re-negotiated and a new contract implemented if this matter is ever to be dealt with properly, and that will mean hard bargaining. Let us get started on it. Let us deal with real needs instead of doing a little here and there and trying to look good, which is what the Ballymascanlon event was all about. That backfired in terms of public understanding about where this Government stands on health reform.</P>
    <P>I want to make another point in relation to our having to include this in the Bill. This issue was raised with me some time ago in correspondence with the Department. However, according to legal advice I obtained, it is crystal clear that this measure, which was announced in the budget, would require legislation. The categories of people who are entitled to full eligibility under the Health Act are adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, and dependants of such persons. The issue of means arises there. Now, for the first time, the Government is taking a measure which is not related to means or hardship. People will now qualify for medical cards on age grounds. That this measure is being introduced at this very late stage in a Bill dealing with other matters is an indication of something seriously amiss with how this Government is doing its business in the area of health. It is indicative that in its fifth year in office the Government is devising a strategy on health. That is the sort of thing people expect would be devised at the beginning of a term of office.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment which I knew would be disallowed on financial grounds. However, I still believe passionately that it provides a way to go forward. My amendment proposed that we amend the health Act, as stated in the amendment we are now discussing, in terms of providing free general practitioner care for all citizens. That would be real progress, real health care reform. It would meet the needs of people, including our <Col N="547" /> elderly. It would provide for those elderly people who are not 70 and who are not included in this measure, as well as for all the other categories of people who are currently being denied what is considered among our EU partners to be an essential social service. We are part of the EU and we get the benefits of being in the EU, but somehow we have not come to expect the same standard and level of basic essential services, particularly in the area of health, that our EU partners enjoy. This is about solidarity, and we are not seeing that either from this Government or in the proposals here.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with Deputy Ring. However, I have a problem with a Deputy who describes us in Fianna Fáil as hypocrites when we have listened to the most hypocritical speech I have heard in a long time, a speech defending the case being made by practitioners against this measure. The Deputy knows there are hundreds of people in every constituency over 70 years of age who are at their wits end trying to meet medical bills. Many of them suffer from cancer or depression. Many of them have to use their savings, limited as they are in some cases, to pay their medical bills. It is hypocrisy of the highest level to make a case for some other sector at the expense of people over 70, many of whom are in a very serious position in medical and in financial terms.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's novel proposal which will alleviate the burden of medical expenses for our elderly citizens, many of whom are in dire circumstances financially and from a health perspective. It may be necessary to take other measures. I concur with the medical profession in its care and anxiety for some sectors of the community who find it difficult to meet their medical expenses. However, there has been a systematic improvement in the guidelines on a yearly basis in each area. The standard may not be what we would all like. I strongly urge the Minister, therefore, in addition to taking the proposed measure, to continue to relax the guidelines in order to alleviate the burden on those who are experiencing difficulty.</P>
      <P>This measure is an innovative one which should be fully supported. I call on medical practitioners throughout the country to back and implement the proposal rather than adopting a dog in the manger attitude. The Minister makes these decisions. He is in the best position to do so. It behoves all of us to support him in his efforts in this regard. I am surprised, to say the least, and I am not sure whether what we have heard this afternoon is Labour Party policy.</P>

      <P>Everything over 70 but as the Minister mentions that, it came in last October and I have people coming to see me who still have not received their free telephone allowances nearly six months later. The system has not caught up yet.</P>
      <P>At the eleventh hour of the introduction of medical cards for those over 70 the Minister suddenly discovers he needs to bring in a legislative basis for it. Is the Minister aware of the anxiety, confusion and distress he has caused for those over 70? They probably clapped and cheered when they heard the Minister for Finance make this announcement. They thought that at least they were getting something and that their medical bills would be covered.</P>
      <P>They have tried to find out what is happening from their health boards but when I consulted five colleagues last night I found that not one of them had the same experience with their different health boards when dealing with this matter. Some health boards advise people to fill in the ordinary medical card form and give no other instructions while others are being told to fill in the form but to ignore the section referring to means. The health board in my area says it does not know what to do but advises people not to fill in the form as it is not the right one. There is complete confusion as to how people over 70 are to avail of the mechanism giving them free medical cards. They expect to get them at the beginning of July but it is my impression that with this change in legislation the Minister will not be able to do so by 1 July. I await his response.</P>
      <P>What is the number involved? I have been told that approximately 35,000 people are involved, which is more than the number of people who qualified for the extra allowances such as free television licences and so on. If it has taken six months to do this, I do not know how long it will take to process the 35,000 people. I understand that not even the Department knew how many were involved when the announcement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been unfair criticism of Deputy McManus for raising the issue of the GPs but what discussions did the Minister have with the representatives of the GPs to inform them they would have to adjust to having higher numbers on their GMS lists? What arrangements were made? Looking at the statements made at the IMO conference it appears they were as surprised when the announcement was made as we were. The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that <Col N="550" /> when making an announcement like this, which gets him good PR and provides a photo opportunity, what he is announcing is going to work.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister examples of the scenarios that have been painted for me. Someone over 70 may be attending a doctor who does not have a GMS list and when he or she gets a medical card it is damn all use unless he or she changes to a doctor on a list. We should not be advocating that people over 70 should change doctors; they are used to their doctor and they may have a chronic condition on which the doctor has a file. The doctor knows when their form is good or bad and when they need extra care. However, with the medical card the patient may have to try to get onto a list and if another doctor in the area is not as convenient to travel to or does not have room for a new patient, then the person may as well have a used bus ticket. The person will not change doctors if he or she cannot access another doctor. In many areas of my constituency and other large urban constituencies there is a need to reform the GMS structure. Doctors are giving service but they cannot get a list as two or three other doctors may already be in place; the Department has not caught up with the growth of population in many new urban areas. I understand that doctors will have to practise for at least five years in an area before they are considered and even then an assessment is made as to the need for another GMS doctor. A 75 year old who goes to a doctor not on the GMS list may receive a medical card but may still want to go to Doctor A because they are comfortable with that doctor or because they can walk or get the bus to his surgery. What are such people to do? They may as well not have a medical card because they will probably stay with their own doctor.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not thought about this. Has he considered a situation where an elderly person is in such a position and gets a medical card but cannot use the card to get drugs unless the card is given by a GMS doctor? A private doctor not on a GMS list who is seeing a patient prepared to pay for the visit cannot give a prescription which allows the patient to get the drugs on a medical card. The Minister will have to consider a category of people who, through lack of choice, will have to stay with the doctor they have, who get no benefit from the medical card and who cannot get their drugs for free because they have a medical card. The Minister will have to see if this can be changed.</P>
    <P>That has been highlighted for me also in the case of contract beds in private nursing homes. In these cases a hospital rings a nursing home and asks if there is a bed available, to which a patient is then sent. If it is a GMS patient who does not live in the area where the contract bed is, the nursing home must contact the person's GP, who may be ten or 20 miles away, and have the person's prescription posted to the home. They cannot get a prescription from the doctor serving the nursing home for a medical card patient who is not on their list. An anomaly has been created <Col N="551" /> here and I was informed of this directly by private nursing homes who have contract beds. They must get drug prescriptions from patients' doctors who may be far away. Many anomalies are arising already and more will occur.</P>
    <P>There is a freedom for people and there are those over 70 who still have the financial capacity to pay the £20 or £25 to the doctor but who would like to have the benefit of getting their expensive drugs without having to pay a constant £42 per month. The Minister made an announcement about the £42 and how it would be good for people but then we discovered that many of the products people could claim over the £42 amount are off the list. As well as paying £42 monthly, which many welcomed, there are now additional bills. They will now find that their medical cards are not worth the paper they are written on if they cannot change doctors.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the health boards have been told to handle medical cards and who will be eligible for them; in this case everyone over 70 is eligible. I had a case on Saturday like Deputy McManus's case. It involved a man who lost an eye through a random violent attack on the streets 11 years ago. He got a medical card at that time but it has now been taken away because he is a few pounds over the limit. His wife has been diagnosed with lupus but out of the blue his medical card has been withdrawn because he got a little rise; he works for one of the semi-State bodies. He must go to the doctor constantly because the false eye gives trouble and there may be a growth behind it but on paper he is over the limit and his medical card is gone. This has caused him stress and pain and though I have told him to appeal it, he is over the limit and if the health board obeys the rules it cannot give it back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Discretion does not mean they get it. The man was in to see me and he was practically in tears &ndash; his false eye is constantly weeping anyway so there were tears running down his face. That is the reality of life that this Government and Fianna Fáil do not seem to understand. Reading out lists of things the Minister has done is no consolation to the people we meet daily. I hope the Minister meets them also to understand what the health service is doing to people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister has allowed this situation to arise. I do not understand why the Minister has allowed a picture to be painted that indicates doctors are against this because those I know are not against it. They would like to have known how the scheme would have been administered so they could change their practices to ensure they could take extra <Col N="552" /> patients who had to move from non-GMS doctors.</P>
    <P>The Minister is engaged in seat of the pants public relations and photo opportunities so he can get a good line in the newspapers and tally up everything. Quite frankly, he must be hugely embarrassed as a result of the meeting at Ballymascanlon. It is great that a young man like the Minister can smile and take criticism. God knows I took a lot of flak in that seat. Pressure built up on Sunday when reports began to appear. The Minister built up a storm before the Ballymascanlon meeting so that he could then ride out on his white horse to show the roll of money he received from the Minister for Finance. I would have loved to have seen a roll of money, just as I would like to see real structural reform.</P>
    <P>I do not know the internal politics of Fianna Fáil, but perhaps future leadership contentions were apparent in Ballymascanlon. The Minister for Finance dumped on the Minister for Health and Children by saying he would not allow the younger man to get ahead of himself, he should wait his turn to be Leader of Fianna Fáil and that he would not be given anything. Anyone who read the large number of health stories in the Sunday newspapers knows that the Minister, Deputy Martin, was whipping up interest in the Ballymascanlon meeting. The Minister's intention was to build anticipation ahead of the 6 o'clock headlines on Monday which he hoped would portray him as the saviour of everybody and lead him into the next public relations function.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin's plan was very clever and it was clear that he had thought deeply about it, but I cannot say it more diplomatically than that the Minister was dumped on by the Minister for Finance. Although it is fun and facetious to make such remarks, it is serious that expectation was built before a Government meeting to discuss the health needs of the country only for people to be told that they would have to wait for the budget. It was not only cynical, but extremely cruel for those whose needs are not being served.</P>
    <P>I read about a woman who needs to see a specialist but will not get an appointment for three years, despite chronic back pain. However, she will probably be helped as her case was highlighted. Those who telephone Joe Duffy or Marian Finucane are told that the Minister has asked an official to ask them to get in touch and the problem is then sorted out. Although one is pleased that particular individuals are helped, cases should not be dealt with one by one. Sick people should not have to come to me, to the Minister for Health and Children, to Deputy McManus or to any of our colleagues to seek what they need. They should not have to lie on a trolley in hospital with chronic kidney problems for two and a half days before eventually getting a bed, as I heard about last night. We should not boast about inflicting such pain, indignity, suffering and trauma on patients and their families. One could understand if accident and emergency <Col N="553" /> departments were over-run occasionally following a major accident, but we should have reached the stage where it is not constantly the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, is in charge of the health system and the buck stops with him, but he is not taking that responsibility seriously. The amendments proposed today indicate to me that the Government makes decisions on the seat of its pants, based on what it thinks today's issue is. It decides to give ideas a little run, for example, when the Minister announced that over 70s would get medical cards. Five months later, he wakes up and realises that he made a mistake by not putting the measure into legislation. Only a couple of weeks after another health Bill was passed, the Minister has decided that another Bill is necessary to deal with the fact that we do not know how the new medical card provisions will work.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be wiser when this debate is finished so that I can tell those who come to me how they will get medical cards and how they will access the service once they have received cards if their doctor is not a GMS doctor. It would be helpful if those who decide to stay with their non-GMS doctors but also use their medical cards are allowed to get drugs. These questions have still not been answered and I hope the Minister will answer them at the end of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved somewhat in this area, but it is not enough. I am disappointed that the Fine Gael amendment to ensure that the situation is improved was not accepted by the Ceann Comhairle. All those over 65, those in continuing education and those under 18 should automatically be entitled to a medical card. As previous speakers said, many families are stressed about health issues, especially if limits are marginally exceeded. Families whose income is £5 over the limit have a chance to be approved at the discretion of a chief executive officer, but those who exceed limits by £10 rarely benefit from discretion, although £10 is very little nowadays. The discretion of the chief executive officer is a matter that needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I know of an incontinent nursing home resident who has a medical card. He used to receive incontinence wear, such as nappies, to the value of £74 each month. Now that he receives the nursing home subvention of £78 per week he is not entitled to any incontinence wear. I do not understand why somebody with a medical card without a subvention is entitled to support for incontinence wear. I received a letter from the health board outlining the situation, which outraged me so much that I immediately sent it to the Ombudsman as I cannot accept it. Such anomalies are consistently evident in hard cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Fine Gael amendment had been taken or if the Minister had looked seriously at this problem the means test limits would have been doubled. Much of the stress on families would have been relieved, especially on those who are marginally above income guidelines. Fine Gael's <Col N="554" /> proposal is only a start as we believe there should be an eventual movement towards full medical cover for everyone, as is the case in many European countries. Until full medical care for all is provided, we must ask if we are being fair and if we are giving the benefit of our economic success to our people.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate objective must be to ensure that nobody feels reluctant to visit a general practitioner when they need to do so. Deputy McManus cited the example of somebody who was reluctant to visit a GP with their child as they owed him £25. That highlights the difficulties experienced and I am sure that the Minister encounters such stories in advice centres when people come to him with hard cases. Health board officials are often cold and inconsiderate when they judge such cases as decisions are based on income guidelines. To its credit, my local health board looks sympathetically on cancer patients, but that should be the case for all patients with extreme difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know of a young person with an advanced form of rheumatoid arthritis who is quite ill and is trying to provide for a family. He has been refused a medical card as the family's income exceeds means test limits by not much more than £10. Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious and painful illness and brings an awful lot of stress and costs. This area should be fully examined and it is unfortunate that the Fine Gael proposal to double income limits and allow all those under 18 and over 65 to receive medical cards is not in order. We would certainly have liked to have fully debated the measure and had it put to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to put to the Minister, even at this late stage. Some fine speeches have been made this morning, including that of my colleague, Deputy Neville. I ask the Minister to review the guidelines on medical cards even at this late stage. The £100 rate for a single person and the £135 rate for a couple, which applied up to a few months ago, are unreasonable. Since the minimum wage was introduced wages have improved, but the guidelines operated by the chief executives of the health boards, who do that job on behalf of the Minister, are not reasonable. An increase of only £1 or £2 again this year is unrealistic. Costs have increased and people are finding it difficult to cope. As Deputy Owen said, some people no longer qualify for medical cards simply because they got an increase in their wages. The Minister should introduce realistic guidelines on medical cards as the current position is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I tabled parliamentary questions on this matter last year and again this year. More and more people are losing their medical cards because of the restrictive nature of the guidelines. That is wrong. I could give the Minister examples of people who need medical cards. The Minister is correct that the chief executive of a health board, a community welfare officer or whoever has responsibility for this area, must make a decision on this, but it is wrong that persons should have to beg for medical cards. It is like every job in the world, including that of politics. Some people take a sympathetic view and others will use the green book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of people, particularly young people, who has developed asthma. The time has come for the Minister to make another political decision, to address the needs of those who suffer from asthma. Parents of children with chronic asthma have told me they must bring their children to the doctor and then pay for medicine from the chemist. They are virtually being robbed on a daily basis in terms of the expense involved. In recent years a number of my constituents who had suffered from asthma for a long time died from chronic attacks of it. I am not a medical person and I do not know whether the increase in the number of people who have developed asthma is related to environmental issues. Will the Minister examine this matter?</P>
      <P>People expected wonderful announcements on the health service yesterday. I want to inform the Minister of two cases of which I am aware. I know a women whose husband died of cancer, her mother died within a month of the husband and now her 13 year old son has been diagnosed with cancer. That woman called to see me on Saturday and on Monday I faxed a letter to the Minister's office on behalf of her son who is waiting for a bed in St. Lukes. That mother is devastated and she came begging to me for help. She cried while asking me when her child could get a bed in St. Lukes. It is wrong that a person should have to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another women called to see me last week about a matter which is even more upsetting. I <Col N="556" /> recently heard a colleague of the Minister talk about the health boards. Something must be done to improve the services provided by them. The system has got out of hand and no one is taking responsibility for anything any more. A three year old child has suffered with toothache since February and I was informed by a letter faxed to me yesterday that that child will not be called for a procedure to Mayo General Hospital until 6 June. In the current economic climate, why should a child have to suffer with toothache from February until 6 June because of a 12 month waiting list for treatment? The Minister might ask why the child could not be brought to a dentist. She needs to have an anaesthetic to have her tooth pulled. Four such procedures a week are carried out in Mayo General Hospital and there is a 12 month waiting list. If necessary, those trained to carry out such procedures should be paid overtime, even if they had to be done at 10 p.m. or 12 a.m., or an anaesthetist should be brought in from outside the county. Those two cases highlight what is wrong with the health services and I am sure every Member could give the Minister other such examples.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of the increase in the number of those suffering from asthma and the restrictive nature of the guidelines on medical cards. Medical cards are being given to those over 70, but the Minister should be honest and accept that those who really need medical cards are those with families, as they are being attacked on a regular basis in terms of costs. If one is participating in a FÁS scheme, one will not qualify for a medical card, given the guidelines in place. If the Minister is serious about addressing this matter, he should make a directive or an amendment not to double the rate but to treble it, having regard to the manner in which medical costs have increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputies, I note we have wandered a long way from the amendment before us. This is turning into a general debate on the health service.</P>
      <P>I deeply resent the comment by Deputy McManus who referred to what I said as hypocrisy. I know who put me here. I speak on behalf of my constituents whom I represent. I deeply resent her use of that word. I have not been lobbied by any professional group outside this House. If a Member on this side of the House spoke the way the Deputy did, and having regard to the slant she put on it, she would nearly be down looking at our declarations of interests to check whether we declared certain interests. If she reads what she said, I am sure she and many of her colleagues would be frightened by the emphasis she put on things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with, and would stand back from, the Labour Party's point of view, which seems to be to do nothing until we can solve all the problems of the world in the one day. That is a ridiculous political position. The measure introduced, to give medical cards to people over the <Col N="557" /> age of 70, is a good idea. There are, however, other problems. The Minister is solving one problem today and that is good. Deputy McManus is right in that young people cannot afford to go to the doctor as often as they would like. That also applied to elderly people. Elderly people in general would suffer in silence at home rather than bother their doctors. If they feel free in the future to go to their doctors more often because they do not have to pay £22 or £25, that is good. I heard of a woman who recently had a bad fall. She went into her home where she lives alone, cleaned herself up, tidied up the house, went to bed and lay in shock and fear all night rather than ring her doctor.</P>

I would have thought she would be dealing with constituents who would be in much the same position as those in my constituency and I was surprised at the way I perceived the slant of her point, that it seemed to be pushing the interests of a professional lobby group rather than the good of her constituents.

      <P>It is not the Minister's fault. There is so much movement of staff that it is difficult. I think many of them do not know what they are doing. Certainly I agree with the point made by Deputy Owen that, depending on the official with whom one is dealing, one is given a different story. I hope once this legislation is enacted matters move along quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies have raised a question and I am raising it also. I am interested in hearing the Minister's clarification but, rightly or wrongly, and I hope I have not been putting too many people on the wrong track, that is what I have been telling them. Although I asked officials in the health board more than once, they could not give me an answer. Therefore I gave my own common sense answer which is, that if one is a full-time dependant, one would qualify. If one is not, if one has a salary as a teacher, for instance, then one is not a dependant and would not qualify. That is my own ruling on it. Certainly there are a great number of questions in this regard and I wish there was somebody who could answer all those questions because, as I say, at health board level there is confusion. However, to blame the Minister for the confusion or the anxiety is nonsense because the people over 70 just want their medical cards. Whether this is set out in legislation is not a matter of concern to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Neville that many people are losing their entitlement to the medical card <Col N="561" /> because people who were long-term unemployed are now working. One does not lose it the day one takes up a job or a FÁS scheme. Many such people are entitled to retain the medical card for three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they are getting nursing home subventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more people working now. If one was unemployed for years and one had a medical card, naturally one deserved the card. However, if one is back at work for two or three years and in a good job, there is no logical reason that one person working for £400 a week would be entitled to a medical card while another person in the same job is not. In fact, that is a cause of resentment because a person who two and a half years ago was long-term unemployed is entitled to a medical card and the other person, who has been working since the age of 18, is not so entitled. Therefore while the scheme which entitles a person to retain their social welfare benefits for a period in itself is a good scheme, it does lead to conflict.</P>
      <P>To return to the amendment, of course this does not solve all the problems of the health service. The Minister is taking the opportunity to give medical cards to everybody over 70 and I welcome that marvellous move. I hope this Minister and future Ministers will make other marvellous developments in the health service as opportunities arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification on one issue because I did not have time to check this out. Was an amendment made to the Finance Act to ensure that people, who will now qualify for a medical card under this new scheme, will not continue to pay the 2% health levy? It seems ridiculous that they would be getting a medical card to cover their medical expenses and then at the same time the Minister would be taking the 2% health levy from them. Will that be amended?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to a number of issues. Governments are elected to introduce budgets. They have a democratic mandate from the people and they take decisions. We do not negotiate with a range of bodies in advance of budgets on taxation, old age pensions, etc.; we take decisions. We took a decision in the budget to look after the elderly in particular and that was reflected right across the social, community and family affairs programme and in the Social Welfare Bill in terms of the increased eligibility for the free schemes, a very significant increase in the old age pension and a range of other supports for elderly people from Departments such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government in terms of housing aid for the elderly. There was quite a theme and a consistent approach across the board to take measures in that budget which would benefit old people and one of those measures was extending the eligibility for a medical card to those over 70. That is the background to the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medical Organisation opposed the decision in principle. It does not disagree with the mechanics but with the issue in principle. The IMO has made clear to me that it would prefer if it were done otherwise. Its preferred option would be an increase in the broad eligibility threshold. Deputy Ring raised the issue of asthma sufferers. In the context of the health strategy which <Col N="563" /> is being formulated at present, we are looking at eligibility for health services and in particular, eligibility for GP and medical card services. Income eligibility alone could be one option whereby income thresholds are raised. That would not meet the needs of everybody, or the needs of those who are medically more in need of a medical card than others. Medical need must be factored into whatever scheme emerges. I am in favour of extending the broad income eligibility threshold.</P>
    <P>The age-specific issue must be a factor. The elderly and the children are two age groups that will always have medical needs. A whole age range of people in between those two groups may not ever visit a GP. There are many people between the ages of 15 and 70 who will not have the same level of recourse to GP services as a person older than 70 or a five year old child or a year old baby would. We must question who would benefit most from that measure. We should discriminate more in favour of families than we do at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a graduated income threshold which would take account of the number of children in a family&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the one in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and which would give a weighting to children. I am also concerned about the issue raised by Deputy Ring. There are varying degrees of asthma. A whole range of other groups, including those suffering from spinal injuries, will have many ongoing medical costs. There are groups of people with minority illnesses and diseases who are not automatically covered either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Those with Friedrich's ataxia and Huntingdon's chorea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but who should ideally be covered by the discretionary framework that is available for use by the health boards' chief executive officers. I met some of those groups recently. Some number less than 100 people. We must look at those statistics in the context of the strategy. I would like to see the emergence of a balanced approach where there would be a commitment to raising the income threshold across the board. Balancing measures would be needed for the disease-specific issues and the age-specific issues in the overall framework. We may have to formalise the discretionary system and create a better discretionary framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation we are discussing today is not a factor in delaying the scheme. The IMO raised other issues on which it demanded settlement before it would even begin to negotiate on the issue of the over 70s. We had another series of negotiations with the IMO last year on a range of <Col N="564" /> issues relating to immunisation and the rates of pay for doctors administering the overall immunisation programme. We settled quite generously with them even though they might not think so. We significantly increased the rates payable in relation to all those immunisation programmes which are essential for good public health.</P>
    <P>A whole series of new issues was raised this year. We reached an accommodation last month with the IMO which will cost in the region of £10 million. That includes increased allowances for practice nurses and secretaries which total about £5 million. Grants for GPs towards equipment and refrigeration for vaccines come to approximately £1 million </P>
    <P>Increased payments have been made for GPs dealing with extra numbers of discretionary medical card holders and for treating asylum seekers. The number of asylum seekers in the country has increased the work load for GPs and this has cost another £3 million. We have agreed to improve the payments for former district medical officers. We are reviewing the work load in the primary childhood immunisation scheme. My officials have been working with the IMO on all of those issues. Part of the agreement with the IMO is that there will be discussions about the extension of the medical card scheme to include all those over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noel Ahern's point that if the budgetary decision to include over 70s was not taken, then they would be waiting a long time. Anyone with experience as a Minister with responsibility for health would support that view. Deputy McManus argues that the entire GMS should be re-negotiated. That issue will have to be discussed either in the context of the health strategy or with the social partners. That will be an enormous undertaking and it will have significant cost implications.</P>
    <P>We will have to prioritise. If free full eligibility for medical card and GP care is extended to the whole population, it will cost approximately £800 million. To extend the eligibility to those up to 18 years of age would cost roughly £200 million. I do not know if the Labour Party is planning for that to happen over one year, two years or four to five years. We have to invest in more beds in the acute system and that will cost a significant amount of money. We have already provided £2 billion for the modernisation of hospital infrastructure under the national development plan. It was noted at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting recently that inflation alone would add £1 billion over the next six years to that £2 billion. That does not include a whole range of other essential capital projects which are outside the remit of the national development plan. The construction industry is working to the limit to cope with the demand from both the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>A broad, balanced approach must be taken to any budget in any particular year. Everything cannot be achieved at once. Key building blocks must be put in place for the reform of the health <Col N="565" /> service and that will cost money. These include the manpower forum report and the negotiations about re-negotiation of the contracts with consultants, the employment of additional consultants, new rostering arrangements, bed capacity issue, and the modernisation agenda. The Government has given its approval for a fundamental review of general medical practice. It is long overdue but all are agreed that we need to look to the future of general practice. Young women now make up 70% of trainees in general practice medicine. They must be given the opportunity for family-friendly, flexible working arrangements. The old ways will not suffice for the future.</P>
    <P>The operation of the medical card scheme is currently the subject of a review being carried out by the health boards' chief executive officers and this will feed into the group dealing with eligibility under the health strategy. That will deal with the anomalies within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville raised the issue of medical card holders retaining their entitlements on entering private nursing homes. They do, and should retain their entitlements. We issued a letter to all health boards clarifying that point again last March that they are entitled to incontinence wear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have issued that. Generally speaking I welcome the broad support for the measure from all Deputies in the House. There has been some carping and some criticism and so on but I take it from the comments that everybody is agreed that over 70s should have a medical card. It is an important statement to come from the Oireachtas. I know others want it all done now but it is not possible to do it all now. Last year we received a record increase in funding from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and an extra £1 billion this year which is being used right across the board. People have to realise that health care is not just about the acute hospital system. This Government had a programme for the health and social services which it has delivered in terms of commitments, targets and spending on a variety of reform programmes. To take only intellectual disability and the physical and sensory disability area, any fair minded person in the House would have to acknowledge that my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, together brought in a major change in terms of the level of funding given to people with intellectual disability. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in respite places for the intellectually disabled, day care places and long-term residential places. More remains to be done but that fundamental <Col N="566" /> improvement has to be acknowledged. In addition, the physical and sensory disabilities area have also benefited significantly but could benefit more and when the national database is in place we will be in a position to meet those needs properly.</P>
      <P>One can compare the budgets of 1996 or 1997 with what happened subsequently. I do not buy the excuse that suddenly from one budget to another the country was awash with money. We were certainly better off. However, there were too many areas that had long been neglected from mental health and access to psychiatric help and so on right across the board. I do not think any party here would make the contribution Deputy McManus made in terms of condemning the Fianna Fáil party or this Government on its record on health. We know there are difficulties out there but we also know that since coming to office and under the stewardship of Deputy Cowen, as Minister, and particularly under the overall stewardship of Deputy McCreevy, we have released significant resources far greater than anything before in a structured and strategic way to improve mental health, services for the disabled, social services, child care, services for homeless people and so on. We inherited a legacy where there was extremely poor infrastructure and we have invested heavily in acute hospital care. There are far more consultants in place in cancer and cardiovascular units than there were in 1997. Far more people are being treated now than in 1997. Between 1997 and today, more than 82,000 extra people have been treated in our hospitals. That has increased volume of activity and increased pressure on the system. Historic issues are converging and are creating pressures on the system. Clearly the historic under investment in health over a 20 year period, prior to 1997, is a key factor as are the demographic changes in terms of the elderly and the population getting older and the basic increase in demand deriving from improvements in medical science and technology. The Government is conscious of its improvement.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus asked why there should be a health strategy now. Surely we have reached a stage of maturity in this House where not every Government feels it must have a new strategy as soon as it is elected, although certainly there can be new programmes. There should be a consistent, agreed strategic framework that governs the evolution of the health care system, that involves not only the political parties but more importantly the partners who deliver the health service on the ground. Over the past 30 years the average length of Government has been three-and-a-half years. Are people saying a new strategy should be invented every time a new composition of Government comes in to office? I do not think that makes any sense. The last strategy was seven years ago, we are now moving&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 13, after &ldquo;1990,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE MAKING OF ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS IN RELATION TO SUICIDES&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I indicated my agreement to this amendment during the Committee Stage debate. It provides that the Minister for Health and Children will make a report each year to each House of the Oireachtas on the measures taken by health boards in the preceding year to address the problem of suicide. For technical reasons an amendment to the long title of the Bill is required to enable this amendment to be made. The amendment does not refer specifically to the number of suicides each year as this information is already available to the Oireachtas through the annual report of the Central Statistics Office, which is laid before the House. However, I am advised that this fact would not preclude the Minister from referring to or commenting on the number of suicides in the course of his or her report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I do not accept amendment No. 18 from Deputy Mitchell. However, when he put this amendment on Committee Stage, I said I would come back to him. Today the CSO will announce, or may have already announced that the suicide rate is down again this year to 413. That is down on last year and the figure was 504 in 1998. There is a significant downward trend over the past two years and I hope this improvement will continue given the investment we are <Col N="569" /> making in the area of suicide prevention. I know Deputy Neville has a particular interest and commitment to that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to our amendment. The past ten years have seen a significant change and the Oireachtas can now discuss suicide on an organised basis. It used to be a taboo subject and up to 1991 it was a crime and the responsibility not of the Minister for Health and Children but of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I welcome the changes in the attitude of the State bodies and the Department of Health and Children especially since the report of the national task force in 1998, which was established by a previous Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 1996.</P>
      <P>We have been very anxious to see the figures for this year. Last year 439 people &ndash; 349 male and 90 female &ndash; took their own lives which was a seven fold increase from the first half of the 1960s when on average 60 people per year took their own lives. The figures have dropped from 504 in 1998 to 439 in 1999 and are now down to 413. This is the first time since the 1960s that there has been a drop in consecutive years. There was a drop in the level in 1993, 1987, 1984 and 1976 only for the level of suicide to resume the increase in subsequent years. It is still not below the rate of three or four years ago because of the increase, which averaged around 16% in the last decade.</P>
      <P>In spite of this we have to look at the positive aspect of this drop in the suicide level. This is partly due to the attention being paid to it by the various bodies like the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Association of Suicidology and others who have drawn attention to the problem. We have also seen the introduction of some of the recommendations of the national task force on suicide like the appointment of a suicide resource officer in each health board area and the establishment of the national suicide review group. That organisation should be given more teeth and a bigger budget. There is a budget of about £800,000 to promote suicide prevention programmes. The national review group has responsibility for that and a further £100,000 was allocated to the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork.</P>
      <P>While our suicide rate is still very high, some developments have taken place since the national task force set up by a former Minister, Deputy Noonan, completed its report in 1998. Although there were 80 recommendations in that report, only some of them have been introduced. There needs to be a more proactive approach to implementing many of those recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently attended the conference of the American Association of Suicide in Atlanta and many of the states there have a very sophisticated approach to dealing with suicide in schools at the level of dealing with crisis and also intervention where there are troubled pupils. I appreciate that this is not the responsibility of the Minister for <Col N="570" /> Health and Children, but there is an urgent need to ensure that we have input into the educational system and not just to assist pupils.</P>
    <P>When a suicide occurs in a school, there is deep crisis and there is no organised system to intervene and assist the people in that school, particularly the teachers. We are always concerned about the difficulties experienced by the pupils, which are often highlighted, but the teachers may also be in deep trauma and be unable to cope. They may not know how to deal with the traumatised children. There are very good models on how to deal with that and we must look closely at those as was recommended by the national task force.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented prosperity, that so many people feel in such despair that they take their own lives highlights the challenge. There will not be simple solutions to this. To tackle the problem in society we must have a systematic approach and programmes to prevent suicide should be put in place. Society must adopt a compassionate and informed response to those who feel suicidal and we must identify the reasons people die by suicide, especially young males. The level of research into that area is totally inadequate. The National Suicide Research Foundation spends a great deal of time looking at the important area of attempted suicide and parasuicide.</P>
    <P>Among the factors which in other countries lead to an increase in suicide levels and which we can identify with is an increase in the level of indictable crimes. There has been a very big increase in such crimes since the 1960s. There is an increase in alcoholism and alcohol abuse here and in other countries that correlated to an increase in suicide. Increases in births to single mothers and marriage breakdown have also correlated to higher suicide rates. These factors are representative of the level of integration or cohesiveness in society. The trends, which have shown increases in suicides in other countries, are evident here since the 1960s. That is not to say this problem cannot be tackled. In Finland and Canada, programmes were introduced which reduced the levels of suicide. The national task force looked very closely at the Finnish model where there was a very high level of suicide.</P>
    <P>We must also draw attention to the influence of religious values, which has waned, particularly among the young. The growing secularisation of society has changed the values system. Social controls are less strict and people often feel alone and lost. There is no longer a pre-arranged set of relationships, with certainty within those relationships, as was the case in previous generations.</P>
    <P>In research entitled &ldquo;Suicide Rates between the Health Board Areas&rdquo;, the late Dr. Michael Kelleher demonstrated that the rise in suicide has been a rural rather than an urban phenomenon, a male rather than a female phenomenon, affecting the young and the elderly, and that some counties have exhibited much higher rates of suicide than neighbouring counties which overall <Col N="571" /> could not be explained by variations in recording practices.</P>
    <P>On a regular basis we have heard that suicide rates are way above the levels of the statistics provided by the Minister. I have heard figures which are double the statistics of the Department which I do not accept. Currently there is a debate about coroners' reporting of suicide, and I recently tabled a question in this regard which could not be replied to. Coroners do not bring in a verdict of suicide and there is confusion as to whether they can. They could not do so prior to 1993 when suicide was a crime because a criminal act could not be inferred at an inquest, the result of a finding of the High Court and the Supreme Court in the 1960s. A verdict of suicide inferred the person had committed a crime. However, since the decriminalisation of suicide I believe a coroner can bring in a verdict of suicide, and when the issue was debated in the Seanad the then Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, agreed with me. There is a dispute in the legal profession as to whether a coroner may do so, and I think the matter should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The statistics are obtained from confidential reports of the Garda, not on the basis of coroners' reports, which are given to the CSO under form 104. Our view is that because the reports are totally confidential and are provided by the Garda, the statistics, which are not fully accurate, are more accurate than those of many other countries. At most there is a 20% variation, and perhaps less, which internationally would be considered very good. The argument that our rates of suicide are not accurate because coroners do not return verdicts of suicide should be put to bed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>For some time I and my association have been extremely concerned by the effect of the media on suicide. The media have played a large role in bringing about the success we are talking about in terms of a reduction in suicide through responsibly reporting the issue and in highlighting the need to seek help and to deal with suicide. Responsible media reporting is vital in dealing with the issue, but I am concerned by other types of media reporting. Suicide is a complex phenomenon, and the paths to suicide are varied and many. There is no single cause of suicide; many interweaving influences and factors come together to shape the last horrific act. Concern over how individual suicides are reported in the media has arisen from studies which have indicated a risk of copycat suicides, particularly among young adolescents and young adults. There is general agreement that reporting suicide is important and can be beneficial. There is more dissent over the manner and nature of coverage. Suicide by imitation has been recognised. In the US, well publicised clusters of youth suicide appear to have occurred following sensationalised, insensitive and inappropriate coverage of suicide. I am constantly amazed by the number of people from all over the country who <Col N="572" /> tell me there have been three or four suicides in their areas. One can immediately identify a copycat situation, and we must be concerned about this. There is a fine line between sensitive, intelligent reporting by the media and sensationalising the issue. The focus should be on educating and informing the public rather than on trying to shock or present graphic, or worse titillating, details.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important guiding principle is to consider the reader, listener or viewer who might be in crisis when they read, hear of see the report. Journalists should ask whether the report will make it more likely that they will attempt suicide or more likely to seek help. Is the report likely to cause extra unnecessary pain for relatives and friends of the deceased person? Last January the President, Mary McAleese, patron of the Irish Association of Suicidology, launched media guidelines on the portrayal of suicide, which we jointly compiled with the Samaritans. This has been widely distributed to the media and I refer them to it.</P>
    <P>Suicide clusters represent a dramatic increase in observed over expected suicides in a community. Copycat suicides and cluster suicides may occur following direct exposure to the suicide of a friend or acquaintance and in cases where the victims were known to each other or through indirect exposure where the victims knew of the initial suicide in the cluster through accounts in the media or by word of mouth.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the debate, but I could continue for a considerable time. I again thank the Minister for responding to the Fine Gael proposal and look forward in the most positive way.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister's acceptance of the amendment and congratulate Deputy Neville and Dr. Connolly in Castlebar. Both of them have done wonderful work and have been a great consolation to families where members have committed suicide. Recently I spoke to a person who was delighted to meet Dr. Connolly and Deputy Neville in Castlebar. They have done so much to highlight this issue and to get help for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families in which a member commits suicide are devastated and there is no doubt that whatever can be done to make their lives easier and to help them should be done. They ask how, why, what, when and where, and there is nobody to provide answers. I am glad that at least this issue is being talked about openly. Many years ago it was not discussed. I am glad some help is available and I compliment everybody involved. I am glad there has been a decrease in the number of suicides for two years in a row, but many people <Col N="573" /> still commit suicide and I hope there will be a further reduction in the numbers next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their comments. I assure Deputy Neville of the Government's continued commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. The PPF has within it a commitment that all the recommendations be in place by 2003, and we are on target to achieve that aim, hopefully before that date. In particular the establishment of the national parasuicide register will be of some significance in terms of ongoing research into the incidence of suicide. The work of the National Suicide Research Foundation, which we will continue to support and to which we will provide additional funding this year, is key to a better understanding of the issue.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Neville that we have not yet effectively dealt with addiction as a society, particularly alcoholism, which is significant in terms of the overall suicide figures. To a large extent previous generations brushed this under the carpet and did not put in place the supports required by people with addictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The new social, personal and health programme being introduced in the schools represents the best framework within which issues pertaining to suicide, self-esteem, self-confidence and better motivation among young people can be addressed. The social, personal and health dimension of the new primary school curriculum will be introduced next September, which will be of major significance in terms of the way children are educated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Files in my Department which relate to Northern Ireland are released annually to the National Archives, as provided for in the National Archives Act, 1986. In the case of the 1970 files, these have been available for public inspection since January this year. There are 29 such files. Material received from the estate of the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, including a small amount of papers, of which 12 relate to the period 1968 to 1970, were categorised as official and released to the National Archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the release of material over 30 years old, no files were withheld, nor is there any evidence that any file was destroyed. However, two documents were withheld under section 8(4)(f2&gt;b) and (f2&gt;c) of the National Archives Act, 1986. One was from the departmental files and one from the papers returned by the estate of Jack Lynch. <Col N="577" /> These documents were of a security nature, containing information given in confidence. They did not relate to arms importation or to any subsequent investigations. Regarding other documents, some minor abstractions were made under section 8(4)(f2&gt;c) of the Act. These included either the names and addresses of correspondents or sentences or paragraphs which named individuals or expressed views about individuals which, if released, could cause distress or danger to the individuals or lead to an action for damages or defamation.</P>
    <P>The material received from the estate of the former Taoiseach also included two papers written after Mr. Lynch had left office which were personal papers. These were the only papers which, on preliminary examination, were considered to be in this category. They were a statement for his own record concerning a journalist's interview with him. They are relevant to aspects of the current debate and, as such, were put in the public domain. These two are held by a political adviser in my Department, Dr. Martin Mansergh. The question of where they will finally be deposited will be considered in due course.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the House that, as these are not Government papers, I do not have responsibility for them. I am, however, happy to reply about them as a courtesy for the information of the House. The first part of a departmental file which contained details of the appointments of the 13th Government in July 1969 was released to the National Archives at the beginning of the year. The second part of the file spanned the years 1970 to 1976 and did not fall due for release. It contains records, mostly of a formal kind, of the dismissals, resignations and appointments in 1970. However, for completeness and to follow the procedure in relation to Government minutes, memoranda and Northern Ireland files, this file was split and the 1970 part sent to the National Archives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions arising from the Taoiseach's reply. First, can he confirm that no files relating to this period were destroyed either by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, or by any successor? Second, can the Taoiseach clarify what will happen to the personal papers? The estate of Mr. Lynch was of the view that the papers were sent to the Department for what was quoted in the newspapers as &ldquo;safekeeping&rdquo;. I put it to the Taoiseach that the safest place is to link them with other papers in the National Archives. I recognise that technically they are not contemporaneous governmental documents with a different status from the other documents referred to by the Taoiseach. It is over four weeks since the recent controversy over the alteration of documents in the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform and those sent to the Attorney General. The Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform undertook to conduct an inquiry into those matters. Can the Taoiseach indicate if the inquiry is completed <Col N="578" /> and, if so, when will the Minister report to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To expand on what I said in my reply about the destruction or loss of files, there is no evidence that files were destroyed in the Department. I had inquiries made about the 1970 documents with present and former staff, including some employed in 1970. They stated categorically that during their service they have no knowledge of files going missing or being destroyed. The Department's policy, since 1986, has been to ensure the preservation and proper maintenance of official files, as it was before the Act. This is evidenced by the volume of files released to the National Archives when the National Archives Act, 1986, came into effect. The Department complies with the Act by releasing files annually. It releases everything, unless restricted. Even in a borderline case, it releases the file.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's second question on the estate's release of papers, there were about 50 records returned last year and they were not evaluated for categorisation as personal or official. They were assumed to be mainly official because of their content. Most relate to the North, but some were made after Mr. Lynch left office and so were personal. That is why the two in question were released. Some of the papers are in the National Archives. The others will be looked at. The archivist from the National Archives assists the Department to ensure conformity and consistency in each section on what is released. The archivist will examine the remaining papers. I have not seen them but an official who has glanced at them informs me that some are personal. Many of them are individuals writing to the Taoiseach expressing an opinion. Except for those passed to Government, all the Jack Lynch papers are in the National University of Ireland, Cork. These papers should join up with&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So they will either go to the National Archive or the National University of Ireland, Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are determined as official papers they go to the National Archives. The fact that former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, held these papers is an obvious indication that he considered them of a personal nature. In fairness they should also go to UCC to link up with other papers. That was clearly his intention because he did not hold many papers. They will have to be looked at first by the archivists.</P>
      <P>On the third question I am told that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in a position to report to the House on the arms crisis issues in about a fortnight. He hopes to have the work finished sometime next week and should be able to report to the House in two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is in a position to report will the Taoiseach make arrangements <Col N="579" /> with the Whips to provide for a question and answer format? We do not just want a statement to be written into the record of the House but would like space for questions to be put to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that matter. Most of the work that the Minister is engaged in is collecting facts from all the sources, officials and Departments. Whatever he says in his statement, he will not be in a position to be questioned on the records themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley might like to put some questions to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The events took place over 30 years ago and it is at that point where current politics and history meet. I appreciate it is difficult to deal with what on the one hand many see as historic events and on the other what many see as very relevant to current political debate. I am aware of the Taoiseach's concerns about the reputations of persons alive, and the concerns of the family about the reputations of those that have passed away.</P>
      <P>One issue I would like to put to the Taoiseach was also put by Deputy Joe Higgins previously. The family of the late Garda Richard Fallon is concerned that his murder may have been connected in some way with the importation of arms into the country. Before the Minister completes his inquiry could he have the Fallon file examined to see if it is possible to publish the papers in that file with the other papers? There has been such a passage of time since the murder that the security reasons connected with the protection of witnesses would no longer appear relevant. Rather than insist on the principle of non-disclosure because it is a security file, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider including it for publication or at the least have the file examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what has been requested by the Fallon family. Deputy Noonan has made a few requests and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister. He will have to seek advice in that matter. The Deputy knows that there were court cases about the issue and the people acquitted are still alive. I will raise the issue and ask for it to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that. In the same context that Deputy O'Malley has concerns about his reputation, the Gibbons family have concerns about the late Mr. Gibbons's reputation and Mrs. Lynch has concerns about her late husband, the former Taoiseach's reputation, I put it to him that there is another family who lost their father. If anything can be done in the context of public papers this should be dealt with also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The family of the late Mr. Peter Berry are also concerned. There are extensive documents in the possession of one member of that family other than the portions of the Berry diaries not yet published which are also relevant. Whatever decision the Minister arrives at and whatever he puts on public display in a fortnight's time the controversy will not stop. Will the Taoiseach reconsider a proposal I made to him a few weeks ago? Will he find an appropriate retired judge, get a historian and an officer of this House, perhaps the Clerk of the Dáil, and let them scrutinise all papers and try to bring forward a schedule of the facts? If the facts then need to be scrutinised further, it will be a matter for the House to deal with as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should consider the next step now because I can assure him that if additional papers are published the issue will not be concluded. A manner of dealing with them must be considered. It would be helpful if people used to dealing with archives and briefs, such as historians and those with legal knowledge and the staff of this House who would ensure that the rights and privileges of this House are preserved, were to examine all relevant papers so they could in so far as possible present the facts to this House in a report. The House could then decide what further action should be taken if required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that when the Minister completes his work it is unlikely to resolve all the questions and issues. That would be difficult with such conflicting views and evidence. The main issue is to try to establish all that is available. We try to do that with the 30 year rule but we will try to see what else is there that might be useful and put it into the public domain. My view is that whatever we can find should be put in the public domain. The Deputy also raised the issue concerning the records of the House. That is being examined and it will be discussed later in the day. That too should be put in the public domain.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to consider what is best to do then and we are already considering that. A number of people familiar with archives and historical facts who have raised this issue with me have divergent views but most would feel that our bringing in a historian to try and put it all together would be wrong. Many believe the only way to put together and present the facts is to bring in an archivist. A historian or researcher would have opinions and at 30 years removed from the facts that would not be the way to deal with the issue. I heard what the Deputy has said about the matter being administered by some third party. We will give consideration to how best to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary duty at this stage, in the spirit of the National Archives rules and the spirit of what it is all about, is to put all the facts into the public domain. People will interpret them differently but we will try to give as complete a picture as is physically possible. We may use the assistance of <Col N="581" /> an archivist to try to present it in a meaningful way. We have also the papers of the House the release of which the Ceann Comhairle and his office are deliberating on. We will give consideration to the other points made.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that section 8 of the National Archives Act, 1986, needs to be amended and that it is not really appropriate that officers from a Department of State, for example, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with an officer from the Taoiseach's Department, should have the power to decide whether very important files relating to the Department of State in question should be released in view of the fact those officers have, if you like, political bosses to whom they are accountable? The predecessors of the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for example, were also Ministers for Justice. It is not really appropriate that that is where the power should lie. There should be an independent mechanism for evaluating all the papers that should go into the National Archives and it should be extremely rare that anything would be refused to be put into the National Archives.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan alluded to my question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the Fallon case. Does the Taoiseach agree that 31 years later, it would be a matter of justice for the family and in the public interest that the Fallon file be released by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the National Archives? Is he aware that disturbing rumours proliferated at the time and continue to do so that there was political interference from a high level with the investigation of that tragic incident? It is a matter of justice for the family that these matters are cleared up. Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said to me that he did not propose to include this case in his investigation and report on the arms crisis and that it was to be a very narrow investigation?</P>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to consider something and maybe reply next week, because there will be oral questions to the Taoiseach. I understand the Taoiseach, under section 8(11) of the National Archives Act, can revoke an order made not to release papers. Will the Taoiseach tell me today whether he will revoke the banning of the Garda Fallon file being put into the National Archives or, at least, reflect on it and be in a position to tell me next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Garda Fallon issue, I have replied to Deputy Noonan. I will take account of what Deputies have said. That is a power I have in relation to Government files, or files within my domain. The Garda Fallon file, in so far as it concerns the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is probably more a Garda file and Garda record. I do not think I have that power but one way or the other, I do <Col N="582" /> not exercise that power other than by way of a general rule that all records possible should be put into the public domain. I am just following the practice that has been followed since 1986 by all my predecessors.</P>
      <P>The second question was about section 8(4) of the National Archives Act. The reason it was included was to make it clear that the certification duty of this lies with an officer of the Department, an officer of the State, a civil servant. I know Deputy Higgins would not mean any disrespect to the officers but it would be a mistake to think that they act under any kind of political control on these issues &ndash; they do not. This is a function they have under the Act and, as in all these areas, they would not consult the Minister on those issues, or the Taoiseach. They make that decision and where there is any doubt, they will refer their questions to an archivist in the National Archives. I would not be asked in any case whether they should release this, that or the other. That is not what happens.</P>
      <P>Section 8(4) of the Act specifies that:</P>
      <P>An officer of a Department of State authorised for the purposes of this subsection may, with the consent of an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach so authorise (except in relation to records of the Department of the Taoiseach), certify, in relation to particular Departmental records, or a particular class or classes of Departmental records prescribed in accordance to <i>subsection (11),</i> which are more than 30 years old and are specified in the certificate, that to make them available for inspection by the public&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) would be contrary to the public interest [grounds have been set down as to what that is] or,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence [That would also be known and in some of these cases, information was supplied in confidence], or</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages or defamation.</P>
      <P>The grounds are quite clear. The officer makes a decision based on what is in the legislation, which is very clear, and on the practice and, in cases where there is any doubt, in consultation with an archivists from the National Archives. As I said the general rule is that as much information as possible should be given, that files should not be withheld and that these sections should not be used to withhold information. That has been followed for the past 14 or 15 years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In some cases, there could be a very good reason to break what the Taoiseach said has been a precedent since <Col N="583" /> 1986. He might agree that there will be a natural caution, especially on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has a certain culture of secrecy and tightness with information. Given that the Act states that one of the reasons for not releasing files is that it might be contrary to the public interest, does the Taoiseach agree that to resolve the matter of the Fallon murder, the investigation, the context in which it happened and the events that surrounded it, it would be in the public interest that it was brought out into the open and that if there are ghosts to be exorcised, let them be exorcised? The Taoiseach has the power under section 8(11) in regard to the Fallon papers &ndash; it is in his hands. If the State or some agency of the State and the neighbouring state, 30 to 33 years ago was, in some way, involved in, for example, infiltrating shadowy paramilitary organisations and that it was related to the Arran Quay situation and the tragedy that followed for a family, it should be brought out into the open. Will the Taoiseach between now and next week at least reflect on the request of the Fallon family?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Fallon family, I will raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but we are assuming that there is a file in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that relates to that which is being held back from the National Archives under the 30 year rule. I am not too sure that is an assumption we should make or whether the file is a Garda file which would not come up for consideration by me under section 8(11) or by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the designated officers dealing with these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Noonan asked. Deputy Noonan asked that the file should at least be looked at and, if possible, that it should be put in the public domain. Those are the two questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without taking issue with the Deputy, I believe the system whereby an independent officer acts without interference is a good one. It works well and, where there is doubt, the archivist of the National Archives makes that known. I do not want to go into detail on some of the exceptions, of which there are few. They relate to name changes and what key people, mostly in the public domain, political leaders, in Northern Ireland said at the time. Very little is held back. Having read the data, I would have thought far more would have <Col N="584" /> been held back, considering the period. However, it is clear that little has been held back. It is also clear why it was a good idea not to release what was held back. It is not that there is much data. It is the opposite.</P>
    <P>I will raise the issue relating to Garda Fallon. I understand what Deputies are saying on that issue.</P>

      <P>A debate on the arms crisis has already taken place in the Seanad. Will the Taoiseach agree that such a debate should also take place in the Dáil? Will he facilitate such a debate? Will the Taoiseach also agree that any debate on this matter must look at the context in which these events occurred and the events leading up to them?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise the legitimate point of view held by a significant section of Northern Nationalists and many others then and since that the real problem was not the actions of the Lynch Government or a section of it but the lack of action and the failure to defend the communities then at risk by moving the crisis onto the international stage, a critical objective which might have prevented the much greater conflict which followed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resist the temptation to give my version of history. It would not help the debate. I do not have a clear recollection but, from my reading of the details, I would have thought there would have been enormous support in those days among Northern Nationalists for the actions taken by the Lynch Government in going to the United Nations, in putting pressure on the British administration, and doing all it could to contain a difficult situation, and among the citizens in the South who facilitated those Nationalists who were evicted, who suffered the trauma of Bombay Street and other traumas.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier today in the context of the 75th anniversary of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Lynch Government was not thanked enough for containing a difficult situation in the Border region and in the South. These issues are of immense interest. It is unlikely that the problems will come to an end on the issuing of further information. Thought must be given as to how best to document events so that people can look at these issues. Clearly not everyone will agree because they have different interpretations, different memories, family connections and so on. I understand that. The least we can do is ensure we have as complete a record as possible, and we should do that.</P>

      <P>Lest anybody thought I was being partial in mentioning the reputations of people on one side of the argument in my previous supplementary question, I am conscious that the reputations of Captain James Kelly, the late Colonel Hefferon and former Ministers of this House are also relevant to the debate. I am not surprised that the Taoiseach has received infor<Col N="585" /> mation and advice from archivists because, in Dr. Martin Mansergh, he has one of the best archivists in the country working for him. An opportunity must be given to persons who hold private papers to submit them for examination. If left totally in the hands of archivists, that will not happen. Some kind of forum that will request that private papers be sent in is necessary. I have in mind particularly the papers held by the daughter of the late Peter Berry which are very relevant. Whatever action is taken afterwards to establish the facts, they will be incomplete without access to certain private papers. Whoever does the job should be positioned to appeal to everybody who has relevant information, whether documentary or verbal, to come forward. Until work is being done at that level, there is no chance of establishing the facts.</P>
      <P>We all have our memories and personal views of the events of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Lynch Government did a good job in those days. The action taken by the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, followed by former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, brought about a situation where, in 1974, the Sunningdale Agreement was signed. That agreement in effect incorporated everything contained in the Good Friday Agreement and probably was a more advanced agreement in some respects. While we are rewriting history, therefore, we should state that Sunningdale was brought down by a combination of fundamental Unionism and fundamental Republicanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, while the full truth of what happened in those years may never be disclosed, the more of the truth we have the better. There are those in the North from both sides of the political divide who seek to raise fears and suspicions and to make capital out of what happened in those years. Does the Taoiseach agree that making the truth clear will limit the mischief making and fear arousing capacity of those people? Does he also agree that <Col N="586" /> for Northern Nationalists it is important to know the circumstances that led to the greatest forced movement of population since the end of the Second World War, and that it is important for Nationalists in the North to know the position of the Government in the South, to which Northern Nationalists look for support?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to papers which are not included and which we hope will become available in the future. Is the Taoiseach aware that important information given to at least one member of the Cabinet on the basis it would be passed to the Taoiseach and to the Government, and which could have had a considerable bearing on the decisions of the Government at the time, was not made available? I would be interested to see in any disclosures whether there were any references to that, particularly in the papers of Jack Lynch which were written at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The papers written by Jack Lynch at a later stage are now in the public domain, other than those officially in the archives. I may go into the archives later on but from what I know they will not throw any great light on these events.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what event the Deputy is talking about. There were issues about conversations with Northern leaders that were not in the public domain, though some are now, but whatever is there is on the record. Other than what is kept for safety reasons, the rest is in the public domain.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie on everyone working out everything that happened in this period. That is the basis of the National Archives Act in so far as it can work. Official documents, Government memoranda, minutes and so on are put in the public domain each year so that people can scrutinise them with regard to any issue to form a view. That works fairly well on most issues but we should not be surprised that people form different views of this issue. The more information we have the more it helps but that is all we can do.</P>
      <P>I do not see how we can see every aspect of everything that happened. Matters were not documented and people are no longer with us, having gone to their eternal reward. All we can do is our utmost and historians will then interpret that in different ways, as they have done with everything else in history. The National Archives Act can only put matters into the public domain. There are reasons for matters not being put in the public domain but I think there is nothing there that will help. The records of the House are in the public domain though I am not sure if those would resolve everything.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie. As I said earlier, we should put into the public domain everything we possibly can that does not damage anyone or give rise to defamation. We can then see how that helps the discussion, though I do not think it will resolve the argument.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that what finishes up in the National <Col N="587" /> Archives is partly accidental and that a much wider effort is needed to get a true picture of what happened during that period 30 years ago? Regarding the manner in which it is now proposed that this be investigated, does the Taoiseach agree that that is not really satisfactory? Society in the late 1960s and early 1970s was in considerable flux, not just in the North but in the South. We had mass movements against squalid housing, the excesses of the housing cowboys, &ldquo;Tacateers&rdquo; and so on. Given that senior political figures of the day, from the Taoiseach's party, intervened consciously to split the Republican movement, which was moving towards the left, does the Taoiseach agree that perhaps the investigation of that period should not be left to their successors?</P>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach was a callow youth in those days and is not personally responsible but he is the successor to the political establishment of the day which was involved in these events. As such, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or his Department are not the best means by which a comprehensive investigation into these events should take place.</P>

He is aware of the views of the House and some additional points have now been made. He will gather all he can in order to be in a position to report to the House on where we are. We will then see what we can do in addition but there is no unified view on that; the Government will have to consider it. I am not sure there is a solution to this that will make everyone happy, now or in the future, but at least we can try to gather as much as we can that is within the National Archives Act, Government Departments and other relevant locations. The Attorney General, the Minister and their officials have been working hard on this for the past four weeks or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the quota <Col N="588" /> difficulties arising for many producers from the foot and mouth disease restrictions I am adopting a prudent approach on the definitive allocation of the 11.5 million gallons of additional quota under Agenda 2000 which is available from 1 April 2001. My Department is preparing a scheme which will make milk quota available on a temporary basis to certain producers who find themselves under serious quota pressure as a result of the foot and mouth disease restrictions on animal movement. Strict criteria will apply to these allocations.</P>
      <P>I have decided to proceed with a permanent allocation of 1,300 gallons quota to younger farmers from the Agenda 2000 quota. This will be allocated to approximately 3,000 producers who benefited from the 5 million gallons scheme which operated last year and it will bring the total allocation of the majority in this group of producers up to 3,000 gallons each from the Agenda 2000 agreement. The permanent allocation of the remainder of the 11.5 million gallons will be made when I have completed legal consultations on the possibilities open to me. In that context I am looking at what can be done for certain categories of development farmers.</P>

      <P>What further discussions have taken place between the Minister and/or his Department and representatives of the Milk Quota Rights Group? Has it been possible to get a clearer or more definitive idea of the number of people who would be entitled to be considered on the basis of a claim made by that organisation and if, on that basis, the Minister will agree to make an allocation to such people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a number of consultations have taken place with this group and I understand it has an initial membership of 1,200 farmers who participated in the farm modernisation scheme and rescue package in the early 1980s. I understand this number has now increased to 3,000. Essentially what is happening is that I have been in consultation with the Attorney General and his office and I hope and expect that those consultations will be finalised fairly shortly because I am anxious to make a definitive allocation. However, I want to do so on the basis of comprehensive legal advice from the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the precise date but I know that officials in the milk quota section of the Department had a number of consultations with the group. I also know that the Oireachtas Committee met the group some months ago and that there were a number of public meetings throughout the country as well. Deputy Dukes raised this issue during a Private Members' debate some months ago and I said I would endeavour to find an equitable resolution to the <Col N="589" /> matter based on legal advice to me. That is what I am pursuing at present and I hope to have it concluded fairly shortly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that information, although I have further queries about the remaining aspects of my original question. Can the Minister give us an idea, even a broad one, of how much of the available quota is likely to be required to meet the need of those under pressure because of the retention of stock? Is it possible to guess how much of the available quota will be required for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make such an estimate. I had a discussion with the milk quota section of my Department this morning and I was informed that approximately seven million gallons of milk will be available following the allocation to younger farmers. It is intended to use some, but not all, of this quota to make temporary allocations. The total quantity of milk allocated as part of a temporary scheme following restrictions and the locking up of farmers who have to hold on to heifers in calf will be confined to farmers who had a verified number of additional dairy cows. The yield will be fixed at five gallons per cow, the period covered will be the period of restriction plus 30 days to make desired alternative arrangements. Part of the available seven million gallons will be used, but it is impossible to tell how much until applications have been received.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the significant delay experienced by farmers between the date an animal in a herd is identified to have BSE and the eventual slaughter of the whole herd, which can be in excess of two months, he will consider compensating such farmers for the significant outlay on feeding, veterinary and machinery costs sustained by the farmer in the interim, which is not reflected in the compensation paid to farmers for the depopulation of the herd with specific reference to the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14126/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In general there is no significant delay between the confirmation of a BSE positive case and the depopulation of the herd. A Depart<Col N="590" /> ment valuer normally makes contact with the herd owner shortly after positive confirmation of BSE, with a view to carrying out a valuation of the herd on an agreed date, usually within two weeks of the positive confirmation of the disease. There is no fixed timeframe laid down in legislation for the valuation to be agreed and it is largely a matter for the herd owner who may need time to consider the initial valuation or may wish to avail of the appeals procedure laid down in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) (No 2) Order, 1990. This provides for recourse to independent valuation and ultimately to an arbitrator, should the herd owner wish to pursue this course of action.</P>
      <P>The herd will normally be slaughtered within a week of the conclusion of the valuation process although this can vary having regard to the size of the herd and the capacity of the approved slaughtering plant. Payment normally issues within two weeks of receipt of the relevant documentation. For a variety of reasons however, there was a delay in the valuation process in respect of a limited number of herds between 23 November 2000 and 25 January 2001. As a result of the delays in these cases, my Department arranged for interim part payment of compensation to be made prior to depopulation and made arrangements for the granting of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the herd owners involved in recognition of the additional feeding and veterinary costs resulting from the delay. The <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the person referred to by the Deputy is currently being processed and payment should issue shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge the level of devastation and hardship suffered by a farm family whose herd is identified as having a BSE-infected animal? Does he agree it is imperative that the herd be depopulated as quickly as possible as a result of the level of devastation to which I have referred? Does he agree that a time lag in excess of two months between the identification of an animal and its eventual removal is disgraceful and creates further uncertainty in households? Why must a farmer care for animals for more than two months and thereby incur feeding, veterinary medicine, machinery and labour costs without compensation? </P>
      <P>The herd of about 180 animals referred to in the question was identified on 6 December 2000, but was not removed until 12 February 2001. The farmer incurred a cost of £21,549.81, for which he was not compensated. Will the farmer involved be given an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment equivalent to the amount he has unnecessarily incurred as a result of the incompetence of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? The animals should have been removed within two to three weeks, rather than two months and a week.</P>

      <P>A problem existed before Christmas as a result of a ruling of the European <Col N="591" /> Union. There had been a major increase in the volume of specified risk material and we did not have the capacity to deal with it. Since then, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved two additional plants, so the matter has been taken care of. I admit there was an inordinate delay in dealing with the case of the herd owner involved. I apologise to Deputy Penrose, who brought the matter to my attention, and to the farmer in question, as it is unacceptable that a problem that arose before Christmas should drag on into the middle of May and that hardship has been caused. I understand that an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment has been set out and will be paid within the next few days but, as I said, it should have been paid well before now.</P>

      <P>Yes, such a facility is provided by a unit of the Department and has been improved in the last few months to deal with the problems of foot and mouth disease. The unit, along with Teagasc, has been based in north Louth for a number of weeks and it will be tied up there for some time to help with the revitalisation and restocking programme that is to be carried out. Once the programme in Louth has been completed, the departmental unit will be available to herd owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my clear policy to re-open every possible market for cattle and beef and considerable effort has already been devoted to re-establishing a number of important markets. Contact is ongoing with Lebanese authorities on re-opening the live trade. A proposed veterinary health certificate has been submitted to the Lebanese authorities which, if accepted, should open <Col N="592" /> the way for the resumption of this important trade.</P>
      <P>Certain legal restrictions on exports of live cattle within the EU were lifted on 19 April in respect of Ireland and on 30 April in respect of the 10km exclusion zone in Louth. There are other issues relating to the transport of animals through member states and to the specific guarantees required by importing veterinary authorities which remain to be resolved. When overland transport of animals recommences, appropriate lairage facilities will be required in France involving the veterinary or animal welfare measures that are required. The provision of such facilities in the past has not been a problem.</P>
      <P>The market for live cattle in Spain and Italy has always been competitive. France has traditionally been a significant exporter of weanlings to Italy and Spain and exports are in excess of one million animals annually. Irish exporters compete with the French on these markets and the huge increase in Irish exports of weanlings to Spain in recent years has been at the expense of France. Irish live exports will continue to be competitive when the trade resumes and that this trade will offer an important alternative outlet for weanlings in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but there are two questions I would nonetheless like to ask. Have any proposed EU changes in the transit of live cattle to the Continent been brought to the Minister's attention at the Council of Ministers? Is the Minister aware of the resistance of the French authorities to allowing lairage facilities to Irish exporters as a result of foot and mouth disease?</P>
      <P>Many exporters believe they will not have access to the lairage facilities to which they are accustomed. With more than a million weanlings coming on the market here within three months, I need not tell the Minister that if we do not have that export market we will have a disaster on our hands, the likes of which we have not had here for many years.</P>
      <P>Why has trade with the Lebanese market not been opened, given that Lebanon wants our cattle for slaughter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the transport of cattle within the European Union, there is growing insistence in the Council of Ministers on completely blocking the long journey transportation of animals, on animal welfare grounds. At each of the recent Council of Ministers meetings proposals were made and supported particularly by the German, Italian, Danish, Netherlands and Swedish delegations. Such a move would affect Ireland more than any other member state. Following the Italian elections, I suspect not as much pressure will be applied on that grounds by the new Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the attitude of the French authorities to lairage, there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease at a lairage near Paris. That <Col N="593" /> lairage was used by Irish and British exporters. We are in contact with the French authorities. We have had some clarifications from them but still have not got clearance from them for the use of lairage facilities. We are working on that and hope to be able to get that clearance. In the meantime Spain is the first most likely country to open up. We are in consultation with exporters to have direct shipping to Spain and thereby obviate the need to go through France.</P>
    <P>We have been in ongoing contact with Lebanon for several weeks. It has sought particular certification of which we have sent it a draft. It is up to the importing country to be satisfied that any country which has had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease has got a clean bill of health. We hope to be in a position to open up that market soon. I am not aware of any other country, European or otherwise, that has opened up its trade with Lebanon to date.</P>

      <Quest>the situation on the sale and movement of livestock; when livestock marts will resume business in view of major overstocking and financial problems on many farms as a result of foot and mouth disease restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks, I made a number of adjustments to the foot and mouth disease controls, based on recommendations from the expert group and subject to strict protocols being adhered to. In particular, recent adjustments have been made to allow the movement of stock bulls, the movement of cattle from feedlots, the movement of cattle between fragments of the same holding and, most recently, farm to farm cattle sales with effect from 14 May.</P>
      <P>Marts may be currently used for the assembly of cattle, sheep and pigs going directly for slaughter. As regards the general resumption of mart operations, the expert group has not for the present made any recommendations in this regard and while I am conscious of the pressures on farmers, I am equally conscious that a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country would have far more serious consequences for the farming community and for the economy generally.</P>
      <P>For this reason I do not intend to relax controls indiscriminately. However, I will take appropriate measures in relation to the phased resumption of marts when the expert group, on the basis of a risk assessment, makes recommendations in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I welcome any movement towards cattle sales and general free movement of cattle. Will he accept that the protocol introduced is a case of bureaucracy gone mad? The fact that every farmer must contact Bandon directly rather than be able to deal with his local DVO or Teagasc office, as was the position in the past, is introducing a bureaucracy into the system that will be difficult to deal with, especially for the older farmers. They could go to their local office in the past and deal with people they knew across the counter. Do computers not work in this country? A good system was set up in Ballymascanlon and Clontribret which showed that area aid maps could be put on the table in a second. Why has the system been centralised in Bandon, County Cork?</P>
      <P>Banks are putting a good deal of pressure on farmers. I am aware of an old man who bought a bull last week and was delighted to be able to do so, but he has 11 weanlings to sell and the farmer who said he would buy them from him told him that he cannot move them for 30 days. Can the system be made more farmer-friendly to help farmers to deal with the major expense they have had and to allow for some normality? The farmer who bought that bull was depending on the money from the sale of the weanlings to pay for it but now he finds he cannot sell his weanlings. He was not led to understand that would be the case but the position changes on a daily basis.</P>

      <P>The movement of susceptible animals is the single highest risk in the spread of foot and mouth disease. That is the final matter to be resolved. We have proceeded in a conservative <Col N="595" /> and cautionary way along the lines of allowing certain restrictions to be lifted. The last one lifted was with regard to the farm to farm movement of cattle. That arrangement was for farmers to make application to the south western services at Bandon. When Bandon came under attack I noticed my two colleagues arrived and I am confident of their support in relation to the very good efficient and professional job being done in Bandon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Bandon has shown in the past that it is an exceptionally professional organisation in dealing with farm related matters and it has the advantage of the database there. I asked the Department officials to examine if the operation could not be more streamlined by the use of fax and e-mail facilities. At present people must send their applications by mail and that takes a little time to process. Those working in the office felt that for the first day or two they would be able to get matters up and running quickly by dealing with applications arriving in the post as that would allow them the full day to process them as opposed to receiving applications by fax at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. . I have no doubt that will be the case. I will meet representative of ICOS and the farming organisations in the next few days to examine how the system can be more streamlined.</P>
      <P>Given that only last week antibodies were confirmed in a herd in Magherafelt in County Derry and also in a flock in the Glens of Antrim and there continue to be outbreaks of the disease in Britain, we will have to take a precautionary attitude to the matter of opening up the system.</P>

The staff in DVOs, especially in the Border area, have given a tremendous service and I would think they are more than capable of giving a service on this issue.</P>
      <P>Are we not at risk that because of the foot and mouth disease crisis we are putting rules, regulations and orders into the systems which are completely unworkable and that on farm to farm movements they are just not tenable?</P>

      <P>Some legal restrictions on exports of live cattle within the EU were lifted on 19 April in respect of Ireland and on 30 April in respect of the 10 kilometre exclusion zone in County Louth. There are other issues relating to the transport of animals through member states and to the specific guarantees required by importing veterinary authorities which remain to be resolved. With regard to livestock exports to third countries, while the import requirements are a matter strictly for the country in question, the situation generally is subject to OIE guidelines. These stipulate, as a minimum, a three month period free of foot and mouth disease before disease free status can be restored. Assuming that no further outbreaks occur in Ireland, we will recover our disease free OIE status on 22 June next. My Department is in contact with our various markets with a view to the earliest possible resumption of the live trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that our farmers have come through a dreadful period from an income point of view, first, with the BSE scare and the closing of markets as a consequence, which was compounded by the foot and mouth disease crisis? Would he agree that it is absolutely essential that the live markets be available for Irish farmers, particularly coming up to the autumn, and that unless those markets are open it is probable that the disaster will continue, as far as income is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the country generally has come through a difficult time and has emerged well from it. Citizens and farmers made a tremendous contribution to containing the disease. No doubt there was a great deal of inconvenience and some farmers were virtually locked-up for that past three months, but prices generally were maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with the Deputy that there is a considerable worry over the destination of exports, particularly after the summer period when cattle traditionally come off grass. I am making every possible effort, not only in the EU but in our important third country markets, to make sure there is a market for the considerable numbers of <Col N="598" /> cattle, which includes a backlog of cattle which has mounted up over the past three months because of the lack of outlets for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Egypt is our single most important international market. We have put considerable effort into building up that market and keeping open the supply lines there. That market was closed because of the foot and mouth disease crisis, and prior to that, because of BSE. In recent weeks a senior official of the Department and a senior veterinary officer visited Cairo and gave various assurances regarding animal diseases, both BSE and foot and mouth disease. It was also agreed that an Egyptian technical delegation would come to Ireland next month. I hope, all going well, we get this market opened but I am not in a position to say that until we get final clearance from the Egyptian authorities.</P>

      <P>Israel is an important market and both the Department and An Bord Bia are following that up. Deputy Penrose is correct in relation to intervention. I have been talking to Commissioner Fischler about our anxieties for the autumn. I explained to him that only France and Ireland have availed of the destruct scheme. Were it not for the destruct scheme, which is a market intervention measure, prices in Ireland would be very low indeed. We are facing the prospect of a reduction from around 90p or 92p per pound to 72p or 74p per pound if we have to rely on intervention. That would not be in our interest or in the EU's interest.</P>
      <P>It is some months since I met the livestock traders. I will meet them again when they make an application to me. Before the foot and mouth crisis, we had regularly visited our markets and attended food presentations in Europe and around the world. I have been in Cairo, Beirut and Tripoli on many occasions, and in all the EU markets. I take the point made by Deputy Sheehan that I should go in person more often but, judging by the competition in Allihies and Eyeries last Sunday, I do not wish to be out of Cork South-West for too long.</P>

There have been well publicised difficulties in advancing incineration facilities in this country.</P>
      <P>A second option being examined is a process whereby carcasses or material would be dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide.

There is a cost to storage and also a cost in exporting the material when the opportunity arises. The volume of SRM increased considerably when SRM designations were increased by the EU last year. We have an acute and a very costly problem. The age profile of the BSE incidence is increasingly in older animals, etc., and we are hopeful that it will be washed out of the system. It could take up to two years to do that. In the meantime, I would like the sodium hydroxide option or some other thermal treatment option to be available.

      <P>The modern technology referred to by the Deputy was provided by the area aid unit of my Department at Ballymacscanlon. It involved the deployment of six staff and provided extensive information quickly in relation to all herdowners in the various zones as identified.</P>
      <P>This once-off emergency facility required experienced staff to function effectively and was only possible because of the considerable progress made in recent years in overall IT development in the Department and in major advances in area aid processing arrangements. In normal circumstances the Department's local offices provide farmers in their respective areas with information about all schemes including area aid. To facilitate this the area aid unit's computerised mapping database has recently been made available to all livestock offices and this facility is also being extended to the farm development offices. This will further enhance the services which my Department's local offices deliver to farmers.</P>
      <P>The area aid unit will this year again continue to hold information meetings at various local venues where farmers can have their problems dealt with on a one to one basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crawford has made a good point. The local disease control offices set up on an urgent basis in Ballymascanlon and Clontibret were effective and their professionalism was evident to all. I did say that a similar type of facility is being rolled out to the various livestock offices and DVOs and to the farm development offices in small towns and villages. There is a requirement that ISDN lines be available in those areas. There is a facility for fibre optic cabling to a wide part of the country which is essential to provide that facility. That process is not yet complete because the IT programme is being developed all the time. We got some additional funding to make this possible. When a farmer visits his local office I envisage there would be private consultation rooms where he could see the maps and have them printed out there and then. That is our aim.</P>

      <P>In regard to farm building grants and capital development on farms generally, there was a problem for the past three months because officers were unable to go out and give approvals and in cases where the work was complete they could not sign off and have payment made. That is now possible. Most of the officers in the Department are on Border checkpoints and we cannot remove those while the overhang remains in the North. The problem continues there. I am trying to see how we might best address that issue and, in particular, where a job is finished that part-payment might be made pending inspection of the work. In relation to bulk milk tanks, if a person gets an invoice and a payment is due I have discussed the matter with senior officers in my Department with a view to devising a practical scheme that can be initiated as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant fall in beef prices in most member states of the EU as a result of BSE scares on the Continent last October. For example, average EU prices for grade R3 young bulls and cows are now 20% and 22%, respectively, lower than last October. The fall in heifer prices has been more moderate at 12%. These figures, however, mask substantial variations in trends in cattle prices between member states. For example, prices for young bulls in Germany fell by approximately 40% to 60p per lb between October and January but have now recovered to 75p per lb. The pattern in the Netherlands has been somewhat similar, although <Col N="605" /> less extreme. By contrast, steer prices in Ireland are currently 2% lower than last October while heifer prices are more or less unchanged. While Irish cow prices are now 14% lower than last October, the fall in prices has been significantly less than in Germany where prices have fallen by 33%.</P>
      <P>These price developments have overturned the traditional price relativities between Irish and German prices. For example, last October Irish steer prices were 86% of the EU average price for young bulls but are now 109% of average EU prices for this category.</P>
      <P>Details of these price developments have been forwarded to the Deputy in the form of a tabular statement.</P>

    <P>The main factor in these favourable trends in Irish cattle prices is the effective operation of the destruct scheme. This scheme, along with increased demand in the UK and the Netherlands because of the disruption to normal cattle slaughterings in these countries, has underpinned the market and has maintained a strong price for our cattle producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My Question No. 107 is related to this. Following the forecast he made a few minutes ago for a fall in price from 90p to 92p per pound at this time of year to 72p to 74p in the autumn, does the Minister agree with the experts who predict a very substantial fall in cattle prices through the summer and for the rest of the year? Does he also agree that the changes that will be made to the purchase for destruct scheme at the end of June will have a very serious effect on market prices? Is he taking any measures to try to offset this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices here generally remain remarkably good, largely due to the destruct scheme. This scheme terminates on 1 July and we will have a serious problem, particularly from September onwards when cattle come off the grass. Effectively we have now only the UK and Netherlands markets. With senior officials from the Department, I am actively involved in reopening the various markets in the EU and third countries. France is not exporting to Spain as it remains closed. Italy has just opened up. <Col N="606" /> There is demand in both those countries and we are seeking to get entry to those markets as quickly as possible. The premia on steers will increase in line with the Agenda 2000 which will make up for some of the shortfall but if we are solely dependent on intervention there will be a reduction. However we do not expect that to happen because we hope those essential markets will open up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Department in conjunction with Teagasc holds information seminars across the country as a matter of urgency to ensure that farmers are aware that there might be such a significant downturn in the autumn and to warn them not to pay over the odds in forthcoming weeks for cattle. For example, £500 is the maximum for a 500 kg bullock which might get 80p in the autumn or £420 for a similar bullock which might get only 70p in the autumn. Farmers need to be forewarned now, otherwise there will be complaints in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I thought the calf processing scheme was a good one but we did not avail of it to the extent other countries did. There is significant resistance to it in Europe by the countries that I mentioned earlier &ndash; Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Italy. There is a very strong animal welfare lobby in those countries and they are totally opposed. At the Council of Ministers, only my French counterpart and I seek to promote the calf processing scheme. It makes great sense from an economic point of view to take out at an early stage animals that are not wanted and for which there is no market rather than developing them fully.</P>

      <P>I have already instructed Teagasc to promote the early finishing of cattle. Both from an economic and an animal disease point of view, there is no sense in having what a predecessor of mine called elephantine cattle when <Col N="607" /> there is no outlet for them at a remunerative price. The premia are very attractive at 12p higher now than in 1989. That will only go some of the way towards the reduction if we do not get the outlets we want for our cattle.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated on Committee Stage that this seems to be a sensible amendment and that he would have discussions on how to address the problem. He is now stating that it is not a problem and is no longer a sensible amendment. How can a person who is in hospital register? We are putting into legislation detailed regulations on how people must register on the sexual offences register. Failure to do so is an offence which is punishable as set out in the Bill. The Bill does not deal with the case where a person is unconscious. It says that a person, without qualification, must within seven days register on the sex offenders' register. The Minister is saying that the gardaí have discretion in applying the law in such <Col N="609" /> cases. We have had cases where gardaí have not used that discretion. Sex abuse is a very emotive issue, and rightly so. On a later amendment we will see how emotions in other countries got totally out of hand. Surely if the Bill passes in its present form a Garda could charge a person who is in hospital and is unable to register. Also, a person might have moved outside their area to a hospital, which is a usual occurrence.</P>

      <P>I made my point already in support of Deputy Neville, but there has been quite a time gap since our last discussion. The point made by the Deputy is clear, namely, if a person is unable to write to or appear in person at a Garda station it would seem sensible and not in any way diluting the legislation to have a provision whereby that person is facilitated and where the unusual situation, though one that could arise, is catered for.</P>

      <P>This is to make things less bureaucratic and easier for the person to comply with the legislation. I propose to take out the reference to the fact that a person has to go to a divisional or district headquarters.

      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to allow for notification at any Garda station or the offender's local station. This might not be the most efficient way of ensuring records are always up to date as smaller stations may not be computerised or fully computerised. My advice is that the smaller stations could not currently cope with persons notifying them in person. Also, some of the smaller stations are only open for a few hours every week making notification by that method difficult. Advances in technology may allow for other means of notification in future, and provision is made for any such means to be prescribed in regulations. Apart from postal notification, notifying in person at a district or divisional headquarters will be no hardship. There is a wide geographic spread of such headquarters, totalling 124 stations, of which 25 are divisional headquarters and 109 are district headquarters. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>My amendment contains no obligation on the person to go to the local station. I am seeking more choices for the person. I see no logic in saying that a local Garda station would not pass on to the relevant headquarters information provided by a person necessary for compliance. If I committed a driving offence and was told I had to submit my tax and insurance to a Garda station, I presume that information would be passed on. This would be another of the many duties of local Garda stations. I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the amendment, which purely aims at getting rid of some of the bureaucracy attaching to what may be a traumatic event for the person. We accept the person may have committed very serious crimes but, at the same time, we want to ensure people comply as far as possible with what is required in the legislation so we have a complete register. It is unnecessary to make the process more difficult.</P>

      <P>I am trying to give the court power to waive applications of the Bill in lesser, minor cases as well as in worst case scenarios as I think there should be flexibility as regards the courts discharging people from their obligations under the Bill. That sums up what I am trying to achieve in the amendments. One should not have to wait for the full ten years before applying because the ten year period would not apply to some more minor cases. The court should have the discretion to waive obligations in regard to more minor offences as well as the major ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 49 deals with a person whom the court decides should be subject to the requirements for a period of indefinite duration who applies to the court for an order discharging the person from the obligation to comply with these requirements on the grounds that the interests of the common good are no longer served by his or her continuing to be subject to them. The Bill as it stands stipulates that the application shall be made before the expiration of a period of ten years from release from prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is suggesting that, under the circumstances today, the opportunity to apply to the court for an order of discharge should not be available at any time, in which there is merit. If <Col N="612" /> the prison term is in excess of two years, the offence is serious and the damage done to the person is enormous. Even if there is the slightest chance of reoffending, the person should remain on the register. There will be situations where there is no danger of reoffending. Perhaps in circumstances where the sexual abuse was perpetrated on a family member, power over the child was the main motive, the family member has now grown up and moved out of the home and the person is no longer a danger to the children outside the home, that person could be safely removed from the register. In such circumstances, the Minister proposes that an application to discharge the person from obligation to comply with the requirements should not be made before a period of ten years. This should be tightened up and a period of 15 years rather than ten years should apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments seek to extend the provisions of section 10 to all persons who are required to notify the gardaí of their names and addresses and not just those with a lifetime requirement. Deputy Neville, on the other hand, wishes to extend the time in which an application under section 10 for discharge from the notification obligation can be made to the court from ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>Section 10 allows a person on whom a lifetime notification requirement has been imposed to apply to the court more than ten years after his or her release from prison to be discharged from that requirement. I explained to Deputies on Committee Stage that this section did not form part of my original proposals. However, on legal advice, based on the notion of proportionality, I included this section. I do not envisage it being used very often. Any person who applies runs the risk of being refused and that would in my opinion be worse than continuing to comply with the not very onerous notification obligations.</P>
      <P>Like many other time limits in the Bill there is, of course, a degree of arbitrariness about the ten years in that it could have been nine or 11 years. However, in this case we had to take cognisance of the advice received on proportionality. I am happy both in that context and from the point of view of fairness that ten years is as near to being correct as makes no difference. The only reason for section 10 is to offer the possibility of discharge from the obligation to notify to those sex offenders whose offences and sentence have attracted a lifetime notification requirement. It has no other purpose and if the legislation did not provide for a lifetime notification requirement in certain circumstances the section would not have been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained the background to the amendment which makes it clear that I would not be prepared to agree to any dilution of its provisions. In the normal course of events, no person can say that a sex offender will or will not reoffend. I do not wish to see sex offenders with five or seven year notification requirements applying to the <Col N="613" /> court with reports prepared by experts saying that the likelihood of reoffending has reduced from, say, 40% to 30% or some other such figure. It would be unlikely in the extreme that a report would say the person will not reoffend. This would dilute the effectiveness of the register to the point where it would be absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>I admit section 10 appears to contradict one of the features of the Bill which is to exclude from the court the decision on whether an offender should be obliged to register and, if so, for how long. I accept that some possibility of discharge from the notification requirement, where that is a lifetime requirement, is necessary. I am happy that the length of the prison sentence, plus ten years, is long enough before the possibility of discharge can even arise. There is a balance to be struck in any provision such as this and, in the context of the legal advice available to me and the policy considerations involved, I am satisfied we have struck the correct balance. None of the arguments to change section 10 is sufficiently compelling for me to be able to accept it. Therefore, I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem logical that if a person whose requirement to register is for a period of indefinite duration can go to the court to have a discharge from the obligation for the full length of time, a person whose offence is lesser and, therefore, has a lesser time on the register, should have the same facility to apply for an earlier discharge. It does not seem logical that the worst offenders have the possibility of a reprieve while lesser offenders do not. That is the reason for the proposal. I would like an opportunity to further tease out this issue. I respect the fact that the Minister is allowing the person an opportunity to go to the court but the facility should be available to lesser offenders as well as to worst offenders.</P>

      <P>The Minister is correct; there is a certain level of discretion. I believe ten years is too short and that a 15 year period would be more appropriate. However, the issue is arbitrary and discretionary. I agree to some extent with Deputy O'Sullivan that people should not be taken off the register. Given the situation I outlined, I feel ten years would be an appropriate period in circumstances where people are no threat whatsoever to society and are not likely to reoffend. However, I am not hung up on the issue because the timescale is discretionary. If the Minister insists on a ten year period, I will not oppose the Bill. However, I believe a 15 year period would be more appropriate.</P>

      <P>I explained on Committee Stage that Part 2 of the Bill imposes a requirement on certain sex offenders to notify the gardaí of their names and addresses and any changes to those details within specified periods of the changes occurring. The purpose of section 10 is to allow offenders with a lifetime notification obligation to apply to the court after ten years have elapsed since release from prison for a discharge from that obligation. A person notifying the Garda Síochána under Part 2 of the Bill is to state date of birth, name and address. The name and address of the offender are essential details and a notification which did not include these details could not be regarded as valid. The date of birth is also crucial from the point of view of risk assessment and also for identification purposes.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to envisage why any offender would wish to apply to the court for relief complying with one or more but not all of the requirements provided in the amendment. To be more precise, ten years after release from prison would an offender think it worthwhile to apply to the court to be relieved of the obligation to notify his or her name but not the address or <i>vice versa</i>? I do not propose to accept the amendment. The small number of requirements when notifying the gardaí and the lack of any practical benefit to applicants for relief from having to comply with some but not all the requirements are the reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment from Deputy O'Sullivan would oblige the Garda chief superintendent to inform the respondent when applying to the court for a sex offender order. I said on Committee Stage that this amendment seemed reasonable and that I would discuss it with the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. I am informed that what the amendment seeks to achieve is something that would be done in the normal course anyway and the effect of the amendment would be to give this practice a statutory footing for the purpose of the Bill. We have reservations about making statutory provision in this Bill for what is normal administrative practice. Such provision does not appear in broadly similar legislation and, if provided here, might have implications for how other legislation was interpreted.</P>

It should be quite clear that a respondent would be informed and I am surprised to hear that this is not normal procedure in legislation.

If it is not in the legislation, it is quite poss<Col N="616" /> ible that the respondent might not be informed. In such a serious issue as sex offenders orders, it is essential to make sure that there is no way the person concerned would not be informed of what is being proposed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, he initially thought, during the Committee Stage debate, that he might be able to comply with what my amendment was intended to achieve. I am not familiar with all of the different Bills where this type of provision is not included.

      <P>In page 16, line 18, to delete &ldquo;longer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The legislation, as it stands, states that a sex offenders order shall continue in force until the expiration of (a) five years from the date of notification of its making being given to the respondent, or (b) such longer period as the court may provide for in the order. My proposal to change &ldquo;longer&rdquo; to &ldquo;other&rdquo; would give the court an opportunity to specify a shorter period of time if it so wishes. This would give more discretion to the court. Since the court can allow a longer period, there may well be a situation where the court might consider it more appropriate to give a shorter period than five years. My intention is to allow the court more flexibility in making these orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Subsection (6) provides that a sex offender order shall have effect for a minimum period of five years or such longer period as the court may provide for. This minimum period is the same as the minimum notification period provided for in section 8. The amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan would allow the court to make a sex offender order for a shorter period than five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained previously that there is a very real connection between section 15 and section 8. One of the purposes of section 15 is to ensure that potentially dangerous sex offenders, whose names are not on the register by reason of having finished their sentences and lost contact with the criminal justice system at the commencement of <Col N="617" /> this legislation, will have to notify the Garda of their names and addresses. In other words, these dangerous sex offenders, by reason of their behaviour in the community, will have to register for at least the minimum period that a current convicted sex offender will have to register. They will have had a conviction which, if current, would have attracted at least a five year notification obligation and they will be judged by the court to be at risk of inflicting serious harm to one or more members of the public. &ldquo;Serious harm&rdquo; is defined as death or serious personal injury. I do not think it unreasonable in those circumstances that the minimum periods for registration under sections 8 and 15 are the same.</P>
    <P>Although not directly relevant to this amendment, the question was raised during the Committee Stage debate as to whether there was any way a person's name wrongly placed on the register could be removed. The circumstances under which a person could be wrongly required to register are few and unlikely in practice. Even where it did happen, such as where the offence was not one included in the schedule, the obligation to register would automatically cease and the person's name would no longer be on the register. It is clear from the legislation that the person concerned has to be convicted of a sexual offence, that is one listed in the schedule, and if it subsequently emerges in a particular case that the offence was not such an offence, then the registration procedure is for all intents and purposes null and void.</P>
    <P>Possibly more likely would be a person successfully appealing a conviction. Such an appeal would place the person in the position he or she was in before the conviction and again the registration requirements would be nullified.</P>
    <P>To make a case for this amendment, one would also have to make a case for a registration period under section 8 of less than the present minimum of five years. That case has not been made and accordingly I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

My intention was to give some flexibility to the court, but it is not a matter on which I feel strongly enough to take up the time of the House.</P>

      <Col N="618" /> This relates to post-release supervision for sex offenders. My intention is to allow for post-release supervision in a case where there is no prison sentence. As the legislation stands, it allows for post-release supervision where Part 5 applies, that is where a person has been sentenced to a prison sentence. Post-release supervision is a very useful instrument in relation to this issue. It is a way in which people who have committed sex offences can be kept in contact with the services of the State and where we can have effective methods of controlling their behaviour and trying to anticipate any problems which may arise. The legislation as it stands only allows for post-release supervision where somebody has had a prison sentence. It should be allowed for someone who has not actually been sentenced to prison but who may have been found guilty of a minor offence in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan. This is a worthy amendment. These people, convicted of a minor offence, are either fined or get a suspended sentence. The court has actually found that they have sexually offended against the person and the provision of a type of supervision would ensure that they did not proceed to further more serious sexual crimes. Even if it prevented one sexual crime this amendment would be worth acceptance.</P>

      <P>Part 5 of the Bill introduces a new scheme which will apply albeit where the court considers the appropriate sentence to be one of deprivation of liberty. Its purpose is to provide supervision in the community to sex offenders after their release from prison. It has two aims &ndash; first to help the offender maintain self-control over his or her offending behaviour and second to provide external monitoring of his or her behaviour and activities. It is clear from the wording in Part 5 that it cannot be used more generally or for other purposes as envisaged in the amendments. The intention of the amendments is that persons convicted of a sexual offence would become eligible for supervision whether or not they were imprisoned. Under the law at present the court can find any offender guilty of an offence and apply the probation Act which can include supervision by a probation and welfare officer. In addition the Circuit Court on convicting a person of a sex offence can also order that the person be supervised. Therefore, it seems that much of what the amendments seek to achieve is already in our laws rendering the amendments unnecessary. Technically, the amendments are unacceptable and contradict other provisions in Part 5. While that alone is not a reason to refuse to accept the policy the amendments seek to achieve, the fact is that the amendments are unacceptable and unnecessary for the reasons stated and I am unable to accept them.</P>

      <P>Yes it is open to the court to apply the probation Act in which event there can be supervision by a probation and welfare officer. In addition to that, the Circuit Court, when it is convicting a person of a sexual offence, can order that an individual be supervised. In my view there are existing provisions which fulfil the basic thrust of the objectives of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 19 and 20 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.&ndash;(1) Access to the Register shall be confined to the Garda Síochána. Information contained in the Register shall not be disclosed to any other person save with the permission of a designated High Court Judge, on the application of a member of An Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Inspector. Such an application, must be heard in camera, shall not be granted, unless in the opinion of the Judge, it is in the interest of public safety to do so.</P>
      <P>(2) A Judge who grants an application made pursuant to this section shall specify, in his or her order, the extent to which disclosure is to be permitted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the controversial and sensitive issue, access to the register and the control of that access. It has been a very contentious issue in other jurisdictions. It is an area which must be clearly addressed in the Bill to ensure that there is no ambiguity about releasing information or the names of people on the sex offenders register.</P>
      <P>I believe there should be control over who releases the information and to whom it is released. Information should be available to those who need to know. It is important that there is a clear level of control on the release of such information. When the name of a person on the register is being released, either to an institution or an individual, the system must ensure that this does not result in vigilantism or violence against any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment before the House proposes tight controls over the information and a system to make it available to those who need to know on the basis of a decision made by a body independent from An Garda Síochána. This is a simi<Col N="620" /> lar approach to what happens in relation to telephone tapping by An Garda Síochána in its crime investigation role. I believe that the proposal before the House of a decision to release information on foot of a decision by a designated High Court judge will have the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the release of information will be under a fully understood system of consideration.</P>
    <P>We must learn from the events and riots and killings which took place last year in the UK following a decision by the <i>News of the World</i> which published names and photographs of convicted paedophiles under its campaign called &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo;. In a publication in early August 2000 a notorious paedophile was named. He vanished shortly before a riot took place outside his flat. The <i>News of the World</i> printed his picture and said he was responsible for sexual offences against young boys. He disappeared from his flat a few miles north of Portsmouth city centre about 15 minutes before a demonstration went out of control. A policeman was hit in the face with a brick, cars were damaged and windows smashed. The flat was ransacked. No one knew his whereabouts. A police officer in Portsmouth said that it was what they had always feared with &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo; and that until the Thursday night they knew exactly where he was and what he was up to but now he had gone underground. We must ensure that a similar situation does not arise in this country where information misused will cause paedophiles to go underground and be a threat to children.</P>
    <P>In July of last year in the greater Manchester area vigilantes confronted a man after mistaking him for a child abuser pictured in the <i>News of the World.</i> The police installed a panic button in his home following the confrontation. Officers were called later that night when a brick was thrown through the window of a neighbouring home at around 9 o'clock. The man was mistaken for a named paedophile who was pictured wearing a similar neck brace to him. The Assistant Chief Constable of the greater Manchester police blamed the incident on &ldquo;an irresponsible reaction of emotive stories in a national newspaper&rdquo; and Mr. Jack Straw, commenting on it, warned of the dangers of driving offenders underground.</P>
    <P>There has been experience in the UK that when paedophiles are publicly identified some of them go to ground fearing vigilante attacks. They move elsewhere and change their names making it difficult or impossible for the police to keep track of them. There is a real danger that such actions as naming them will increase the risk to children rather than reduce it. In late August of last year vigilantes vandalised the home of a prominent children's doctor in Wales after apparently confusing her title of paediatrician with paedophile.</P>
    <P>A specialist in paediatric medicine at Royal Gwent Hospital fled her home after her windows and front door were spray painted with the word &ldquo;paedo&rdquo;. The paediatrician had to move into a <Col N="621" /> friend's home and did not return to her rented house. She said it was just unbelievable and terrible that people could think they had the right to vandalise a person's property like that no matter what a person might have done. At that stage Britain had been obsessed with the subject of paedophiles following the death of an eight year old girl discovered in a field. Right across Britain, several people who share surnames with alleged offenders named by the <i>News of the World</i> have also had their homes attacked by vigilante gangs. In Portsmouth 70 miles west of London police had five innocent families forced to leave their homes after threats from neighbours. One man reportedly was suspected simply because he lived alone and talked about how much he loved his mother.</P>
    <P>To ensure that there is not a risk to law and order and to ensure that children are protected by ensuring that paedophiles do not go underground it is important that there are clear distinct procedures for the release of information to those who need to know.</P>
    <P>Again last year in the UK Julie Legge locked herself inside her home closely guarding her three children. She was too frightened to use the bus or go to local shops after 150 screaming vigilantes mistakenly identified her husband as a paedophile. She said she had been suffering from panic attacks ever since she returned with her family from a holiday in Spain to find their car reduced to a burnt out wreck, their windows smashed and home burgled. Lynch mobs in the area made innocent people's lives a nightmare. Nobody wants paedophiles around children but violence is the wrong way to go about it. We must ensure that such a situation does not happen in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Understandably, because this issue stirs up strong emotions, the aspect raised by Deputy Neville, in which I support him, is crucial to this legislation. Who should have access to the register and how it should be used must be got right if it is to be effective. Deputy Neville gave a number of British cases where abuse of access to the register caused suffering and sex offenders to go underground away from police supervision. I share his view that it is important to ensure that control of the register does not result in attacks on people in their own homes, on people who are not sex offenders, or offenders going underground because they are identified as living in a particular area. This legislation must contain clear provisions on exactly who has and has not access to the register and how the information should be used. I support Deputy Neville's proposal. I am not sure how it should be done. He proposes it should be with the permission of a designated High Court Judge. However it is done, both ourselves as legislators and the public must be satisfied that it is appropriate, that the register achieves the end of safeguarding the public from offenders and that it is complied with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Neville explained at Select Committee, this amendment is about setting a basis through the courts for deciding who has access to the register. There are some technical points about which I am unhappy, for example, the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill's text. I oppose it because it runs counter to the philosophy and policy of Part 2 of the Bill. Access to the register is not covered by it. Access cannot adequately or properly be dealt with in legislation but can be more appropriately dealt with administratively. The intention is that the information in the register will be used by the Garda in conjunction with the Probation and Welfare Service to assess risk.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville is rightly concerned at what he described on Committee Stage as the loose way information might be disclosed. He also alluded to the possibility of information being released in a way not intended. Those points deserve an answer. The notification system will be the basis of continuous risk assessment of convicted sex offenders by the Garda Síochána and the Probation and Welfare Service. No one else will, as of right, have access to that information. Any leak of information is deplored but I am confident that no leak will occur. In Deputy Neville's examples, none of the names concerned was released by the police. I am satisfied that it will be the same in this jurisdiction. Apart from any other consideration, there would be no point in doing so but should the worst happen, it would be irrelevant to how it should properly be disclosed, whether on a judge's instruction or a decision at inter-agency level by the Garda and the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Garda to draw up a protocol with that service as to what circumstances warrant disclosure in any particular case. As in the North of Ireland, it will only be disclosed when there is a serious and immediate danger to a person or persons, and even then only to the minimum number with an absolute need to know. The last thing we need is disorder, personal injury or witch hunts, as eloquently described by Deputy Neville, arising from disclosure. When the Garda conclude that another person or persons will be informed of an offender's name, it will be because they are sure there is an immediate, serious risk to someone. The risk and its immediacy are important. These will be determined using normal crime prevention techniques and the risk assessment arising from a person being obliged to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with this amendment is that it transfers the decision from the persons who have been watching, assessing and possibly treating the offender on a continuing basis to the court which will be asked to make an immediate decision. Applications to the court take time. Reports must be prepared and the court might request experts' reports, which can often conflict. It is not a system designed for immediate action, and immediate means just that, not tomorrow, the next day or next week. It is not a court's function to be a rubber stamp, which it would have to be if it had <Col N="623" /> to act as the Garda could where an immediate risk to a child, for example, became apparent.</P>
    <P>Giving information from the register to the public carries huge risks and responsibilities, as we have seen across the water and as outlined by Deputy Neville. He also referred to this on Committee Stage. I know of no evidence that details of any of the persons whose names were published came from an official source. As I said, I envisage the power to disclose being used sparingly. The Garda will develop its own means of risk assessment, when, where and to whom any public access should be made. I imagine a first move will be to warn the offender about his or her behaviour and suggest a move to a place where children do not congregate, or seek a sex offender order.</P>
    <P>There will be no public access to the register. I understand Deputies Neville's and O'Sullivan's concerns. Information may be disclosed in the exceptional circumstances to which I referred and then only on a strictly need to know basis. Good policing practice rather than court intervention is the most appropriate, efficient way to decide on when and to whom that information is given. I sympathise with the philosophy underlying the amendment as expressed by Deputy Neville and supported by Deputy O'Sullivan. I trust they will understand why I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Minister's approach to the Garda and how to handle the situation. That was not my point. I do not envisage court hearings. The amendment says permission of a designated court judge. It would be his decision, not on the basis of a court sitting but on the basis of being in the position of a third party evaluating independently if information should be released. I do not envisage, and it is a not the amendment's intention, that reports would be made available. A judge could be designated and accessed quickly allowing a decision to be made as quickly as is necessary. It would be a check and balance on the release of information. I do not object to continuous assessment of offenders by the Garda. That is the purpose of the Bill and this does not impact on that. Gardaí are human, and people have strong, different views on issues like this. Some feel strongly that sex offenders should not live in any community whatsoever. That is a serious situation. If a member of An Garda Síochána, with no wrongdoing in mind, who conscientiously felt that somebody who committed a sex offence, was convicted and was on a register should not be in any community in their area of responsibility. He might, in conscience, feel that way and decide to release the information to ensure what he believed to be the proper situation prevailed. There are people who feel like that and one can understand why they do but we have to deal with the situation in front of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a member of the Garda Síochána of whatever rank or any other person with information <Col N="624" /> decides it should be released, there should be one simple check where a third party would examine the situation very quickly and decide whether the information should be released. If that check was in place, 99.9% of requests for the release of the information would be granted because the person who initiated the request would know there were checks and balances in place and would ensure they complied with all reasonable conditions, investigations and examinations of the case. If such a check was in place, it would be very rare, if at all, for the designated person to refuse the request.</P>
    <P>This is to cover a situation where somebody in authority conscientiously felt that sex offenders should not be in that community no matter what. I agree with the Minister when he says the register acts as a deterrent. One of the biggest strengths of the Bill, is that people on the register know the Garda know of their whereabouts, that the Garda are being vigilant in regard to their movements and that they are under scrutiny. In such circumstances, disclosure will only be made when a situation is quite serious. There should be some third party examination to guard against abuse of the release of information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this issue would be more appropriately dealt with administratively. Will he expand on that? Does he intend to designate what kind of administrative procedure should take place as in what rank of Garda, for example, might make these decisions or in regard to the level of information in terms of what a person has done? If Deputy Neville's amendment is not accepted, we need to know a little more about how these decisions will be made. For example, it is possible that a Garda serving in a station, who might not know the background information on why a person's name was on the register and the level of danger that person might pose to a community, might make a decision that the information should be disclosed to a community. Maybe if they had more direct involvement in this person's case, there might be information there which would lead them to make a different decision.</P>
      <P>I am really expanding on the issues referred to by Deputy Neville. With the best of intentions, a garda might decide it is appropriate to disclose information to certain persons when that might do more harm than good both to the community and the people that garda would be seeking to protect. Before we make any decision on this amendment, we need to get more information from the Minister on how he envisages this will be dealt with, if not in the legislation, then by way of administrative decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns expressed by Deputy Neville and Deputy O'Sullivan. The position will be that the Garda Síochána will agree a protocol with the Probation and Welfare Service on the question of disclosure. Disclosure will take place on the basis of there being <Col N="625" /> an immediate and serious risk to some person or persons. That is the basic criterion outlined in the legislation on the question of disclosure. As to who would make the disclosure and how it would be made, this is a matter which would have to be agreed by the Garda Síochána and the Probation and Welfare Service. I am confident they will be in a position to do this.</P>
      <P>I outlined earlier that the police in Britain were not responsible for releasing the names of paedophiles to certain publications there. I remain absolutely confident a similar situation will prevail here and members of the Garda Síochána will not release names to newspapers and they will obey the fundamental criterion which is that there must be a serious and immediate risk to a person or persons. I do not know where the British publications obtained the names of the paedophiles in question but I understand there are organisations in Britain which record the names of people who are convicted of offences of this nature. It is quite possible that they got the names from some or other of these organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I can safely say that from my perspective and from the investigations I have carried out the names Deputy Neville outlined today were not given out by the police. It is also possible that the newspapers could have got the information through another means, but this is the information that is available to me.</P>
      <P>The release of the names will be carried out in a controlled manner on an agreed protocol. To transfer the decision on the disclosure of the name or names to the courts in a situation where we are speaking about the need for immediacy &ndash; in other words, we are speaking about an urgent need to disclose on the basis of there being an immediate and serious risk &ndash; would not be desirable. The reason is that the people who are watching, controlling, monitoring and assessing the risk would have the duty of disclosure transferred from them to a court which would not assess the situation on an ongoing basis in the manner I have outlined. There is no point saying the courts would not look for a report. The reality is that once an application is made by the very people who, incidentally, would seek to make the disclosure, reports would be sought. It would not be desirable, although I understand the concerns expressed by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a big play about the courts. I made the point that it would be a designated High Court judge. If he wants to designate somebody other than a High Court judge, he could have taken it on board on Com<Col N="626" /> mittee Stage or in the Seanad. I want an independent person to examine the release of the information for the reasons I stated. I do not want to be repetitive. The Minister has latched on to this idea of the courts. I said a designated High Court judge but the Minister may want to designate somebody outside the courts who is in a position and has the training and capacity to objectively evaluate what is happening quickly. That was my intention. It is extremely loose to say in a very serious situation such as this where everything else has been tidied up, that this important area will be left to the Probation and Welfare Service and the Garda Síochána. It is the work of the Oireachtas to decide how this information should be released, because of its sensitivity and the need to ensure there is no risk to law and order, or to children as a result of sex offenders going underground and changing their names and their identities so that they are not under the vigilance of the Garda Síochána and can thus pose a danger to children.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the area of the print media, which is fair enough. However, there is no reason to suppose it would not happen that a conscientious garda of any rank in a community in a divisional area might be of the firm view that a sex offender who has just registered should not be living in an estate of 500 houses and conscientiously release the information, without any evidence that the person was not complying fully with the law or was posing a threat to children. If we go down that road, people who have been released from prison having served sentences for sex offences and having paid their dues to society will not be able to live in any community. That is the logic of saying that a person should not live in a particular community. There are people who conscientiously believe that.</P>
      <P>I want checks and balances. The Minister seems to be hung up on the courts because there is reference to a judge in the amendment. I meant a judge sitting in his chambers to examine a case and make a decision, as opposed to a court procedure with barristers, lawyers and so on. The Minister can change that to a judge in the Seanad if he is hung up on the courts.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this. It should be legally provided that we here should decide how the information is released, not two bodies of the State, the Garda Síochána and the probation and welfare officers, who might decide to handle such matters differently in different districts or to handle them on a national basis. If decisions are to be made on a national basis, we as legislators should make them. It is our duty to regularise this, and it would be negligent not to deal with this issue in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 29 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notice of intention to make an application under section 3 or 4 shall be given to the prosecution by or on behalf of the accused person before, or as soon as practicable after, the commencement of the trial for the offence concerned or, as the case may be, the commencement of the proceeding concerned referred to in section 4(1).</P>
      <P>(3) The prosecution shall, as soon as practicable after the receipt by it of such a notice, notify the complainant of his or her entitlement to be heard in relation to the said application and to the legally represented, for that purpose, during the course of the application.</P>
      <P>(4) The judge shall not hear the said application without first being satisfied that subsections (2) and (3) have been complied with.</P>
      <P>(5) If the period between the complainant's being notified, under subsection (3), of his or her entitlements under this section and the making of the said application is not, in the judge's opinion, such as to have afforded the complainant a reasonable opportunity to arrange legal representation of the kind referred to in this section, the judge shall postpone the hearing of the application (and, for this purpose, may adjourn the trial or proceeding concerned) for a period that the judge considers will afford the complainant such an opportunity.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 61, in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan, proposes to delete and replace subsection (2) of section 33. In examining the amendment, some questions arose as to the meaning of parts of the existing subsection (2), for example, the requirement that the complainant in a sexual offence case be informed either by or on behalf of the accused is somewhat incongruous.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 60 in my name deletes subsections (2) and (3) of section 33 and replaces them with three new subsections. It provides that a judge must be satisfied that a defendant, or his/her legal representatives, notifies the prosecution before or as soon as practicable after the commencement of the trial of his intention to make an application under section 3 or 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, before considering such an application. As soon as practicable, the prosecution must notify the complainant of such an application and consequently of the complainant's right to be heard and legally represented during the hearing of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment strays into the territory of administrative practice. Following a <Col N="629" /><Col N="630" /> thorough examination of the issues involved, I am satisfied that such practice is unsuited to being placed on a statutory basis. Several measures have been introduced in recent years aimed at providing for and improving the position of the complainant in criminal trials. Procedures are now in place to allow the prosecution team to arrange pre-trial consultation with complainants in serious sexual assault cases. This helps to familiarise complainants with legal procedures and allows the prosecution team to explain the layout and procedures of the court and the matters that may be the subject of examination by counsel. Other measures have been set out in the discussion paper on the law regarding sexual offences, published in 1998.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable to consider the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan in her amendment in the context of the analysis of views received in the relevant chapter of the discussion paper. It has little in common with section 33 of this Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for legal representation in certain circumstances. I commend amendment No. 60 to the House and I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for drawing my attention to the relevant provision. For the reasons I have stated, I am unable to accept her amendment but good certainly came of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the content of the Minister's amendment. In my amendment I sought to ensure the complainant is fully informed of his rights under the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981. I welcome the fact that this section has been added to the Sex Offenders Bill. If the complainant's sexual history is brought before the court, she will have the right to legal representation. We have already spoken of this matter when discussing the main body of the Bill. It is undesirable for the defence team to be required to notify the complainant at the outset of proceedings of the requirement of this section. My amendment tried to shift the requirement to the prosecution and to require the prosecution to keep the complainant informed of the progress of the case.</P>
      <P>We know that complainants in rape cases often feel seriously under-informed and under-supported in the court process. This plays no small part in the fact that many rape victims do not go to court. Two days ago, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre produced a report which was discussed by the Minister and I on last night's Adjournment debate. The report said that one-fifth of those who go to the Rape Crisis Centre having been raped report the case to the Garda, which means that only a small percentage of those who say they have been raped go through with court proceedings. We have been told many times by those who represent victims, particularly the Rape Crisis Centre, that the court procedure is extremely difficult for victims. The complainant is treated as another witness of the State and is not given any particular priority in terms of being kept informed or as regards representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I welcome and acknowledge the important step forward that has been taken in this Bill and the fact that the complainant is now entitled to representation if sexual history is to be brought up in court. We need to do more, however, whether with this legislation or by separately amending the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981. It is possible to go further, although I understand the balance of justice that is required between the defence and prosecuting sides. It would not be legally impossible to make it part of the role of a person on the State's team, a barrister or a solicitor, to keep complainants constantly informed of what is going on. The complainant needs to continually know what is happening regarding her case.</P>
    <P>I consulted with those involved in this area before speaking here today. I was told that the stress encountered by complainants in court is a serious problem as they often feel they are almost incidental, just one of many witnesses in the case. In the context of these amendments, I ask the Minister to take the issue I have raised on board. Whatever measures can be taken must be taken to provide for this issue, preferably in this Bill although that may not be possible.</P>
    <P>A representative of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre said on the radio last night that it takes about two years for a rape case to come to court. It may take the DPP a year or more to decide whether there is a case to be heard and then another year may pass before the case reaches the court. The trauma of the court case is then faced by the complainant. In many cases, the person concerned is simply not strong enough to proceed with the necessary procedures. Anything the State can do to make it easier for victims to see the entire procedure through should be done. I appeal to the Minister to consider, in this Bill or otherwise, providing a more supportive situation in court for complainants in cases of rape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy O'Sullivan said. The situation in court for rape victims has been a disgrace over the years. They have felt intimidated, have been unaware of what was happening and have often felt they were the accused persons. This section is a welcome development to improve that position. Any measure that can ease the difficulty for rape victims should be introduced. What creates most stress for rape victims, who have suffered a terrible crime and who continue to suffer because of the nature of it, is simply not knowing what is happening, when a court will sit or what statements will be made about them. Anything that can be done should be done to keep a complainant &ndash; who in 99.9% of cases is a woman &ndash; informed, to ensure her rights are fully protected and that she does not come under the scrutiny of clever lawyers who can manipulate a situation and intimidate a victim. This Bill eases that situation and I welcome that. What Deputy O'Sullivan proposes would further improve the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it relates to representation of victims of serious sexual offences, this legislation is ground-breaking because, for the first time in Irish criminal law, provision is being made for a person who is a complainant or victim to be represented during the course of a trial. The best advice available to me is that it would not be possible to provide legal representation throughout the trial because the accused would then be cross-examined not just by counsel for the prosecution but by counsel for the complainant. I am informed that this would not stand up.</P>
      <P>I realise this is something that has been sought by many woman's groups and Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country over a long period. The legal position is that I have gone as far as I could go within legal parameters by providing that the complainant in a serious sexual offence case will be in a position to have legal representation where the defence seeks to adduce evidence of the complainant's previous sexual history. I am introducing, in our criminal law for the first time, the right of a complainant to be represented during the trial process. I accept this is during the period of a trial within a trial where the question as to the admissibility of that evidence is being considered. It is, however, a major step forward. It should give complainants, who are mostly woman, a far greater degree of comfort and of security in terms of making complaints and in terms of their cases being pursued through the courts. It is perfectly understandable how a woman would be frightened of a trial within a trial where she had no representation and where the defence was seeking to bring forward the most intimate details very often of the complainant's sexual history. The introduction of the representation we are bringing forward in this legislation is a major step forward. I stress this is the furthest I could go within the advice available to me, which took account of the legal parameters beyond which I could not stray.</P>

      <P>I was not seeking to have someone cross-examine the defence in the general course of the trial but for someone to provide information and it need not be a barrister.</P>
      <P>When we discussed the issue raised by Deputy Neville in the previous amendment on earlier Stages, the Minister talked about agreeing a protocol on the release of information on the register. His legal advice is telling him that he cannot provide for what I am seeking in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can he provide a protocol whereby the State in taking such cases would be directed to provide the type of support I am seeking that would not necessarily have to be included in this legislation? I am seeking to achieve this without going against the advice of the Attorney General, on whose advice I presume the Minister's reply is based. I ask the Minister to explore <Col N="633" /> other ways in which it could be agreed that the State, as prosecutor, would provide this type of support.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people, who have suffered these crimes, who bring a case through the court proceedings, is very small which is of very serious public concern. If more cases were taken and more prosecutions secured, that would be major a deterrent in such crimes. The offenders get away with it because it is difficult for their victims to go through the court process. If the Minister cannot provide for what I seek in this legislation, can he do so in some other way?</P>

      <P>I understand what Deputy O'Sullivan is seeking to achieve. I was responding to the more general point in regard to the complainant participating in the trial process. The Deputy's proposal is a reasonable one and it is possible to provide for it in legislation. It is the administrative practice at the present time. The difficulty is it does not relate to the section in so far as it is currently presented. The chapter dealing with this issue in the sexual offences paper will be the subject matter of further legislation. It would be more appropriate to include the provision brought forward by the Deputy in that legislation rather than in this Bill, which deals with certain but not all segments of the discussion paper.</P>
      <P>The discussion paper is the genesis for further legislation that will be brought forward to deal with sexual offences to ensure we will have a reformed and more modern basis of legislation where serious sexual offences in our community can be more expeditiously and effectively prosecuted.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House today is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative regime to promote and enhance the safety of <Col N="635" /> all persons who engage in adventure activities at adventure centres in Ireland. The key provision of the Bill is the establishment of an independent standards authority to regulate the safety of adventure activity centres and providers.</P>
    <P>Specifically it will allow for the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority; mandatory registration of adventure centres and providers with the authority for specified activities; mandatory codes of safe operating practice for specified adventure activities; implementation of a regulatory scheme involving inspection of centres and providers for adherence to safety codes and powers for the authority to order cessation of the provision of any or all adventure activities in the case of failure to observe safety codes.</P>
    <P>It is well known that, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the safety of those participating in adventure activities, particularly young people, is very important to me. Deputies will recall that on the evening of 18 February 1995, two young people tragically died in a canoeing accident at Dunmore East, County Waterford, when they were swept out to sea in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. The fatalities occurred in the context of a canoeing expedition involving a group of individuals whom, while not members of a club, organisation or activity centre, were under the unofficial leadership of a trainee adventure centre instructor.</P>
    <P>My Department carried out a review of the accident following which an intensified safety awareness effort aimed at the marine leisure sector was launched by the Department and organisations involved in water sports safety. Mr. Michael Davies, whose son Ros lost his life in the accident at Dunmore East, has campaigned intensively since the tragedy to have the activities of adventure centres, which operate on a commercial basis, regulated from a safety perspective.</P>
    <P>In August 1998, a Private Members' Bill entitled the Adventure Centres (Young Persons' Water Safety), Bill, 1998, was introduced by Deputy Finucane, and debated in the Dáil at the end of March 1999. The Bill, which was based largely on the legislative framework introduced in the UK in 1995, proposed that a new licensing and policing scheme for adventure centres be established by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority. However, that Bill was confined to watersports, and the general view of Members of the Dáil was that while regulation was necessary, any new legislation should extend to all adventure activities, not just water based activities. During the Dáil debate, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, stated that the Government intended to bring forward a Bill of this kind as soon as possible. As part of this process, Deputy Woods set up an interdepartmental working group to undertake urgently a detailed examination of the issues and to consider the possible regulation of adventure activities. It was <Col N="636" /> therefore agreed in the House that the Private Members' Bill would stand in abeyance until the results of the interdepartmental working group examination were known.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this group was an expression of the importance which we in the Department attach to tackling this issue. The working group was representative of Departments and agencies and was charged with making recommendations aimed at enhancing safety in adventure centres. In accordance with its terms of reference, it was to consult with those with interests in the sector, examine models in other countries, assess current safety arrangements in Ireland and make proposals based on the findings.</P>
    <P>The working group consulted widely, meeting all the main representative bodies in the sector in Ireland. It also consulted with neighbouring jurisdictions in the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, to ascertain their views on the effectiveness, or otherwise, of the recently introduced UK legislation in increasing the safety for participants in commercial adventure centre activities. The group received submissions from a number of persons and organisations with an interest in the subject and it sought and received the help of the Department of Foreign Affairs in ascertaining whether other EU countries, Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada operated safety licensing of adventure centres or other suppliers of adventure activities. The working group also enlisted the help of a consultancy company to assist it in ascertaining the nature and size of the sector in Ireland and the likely impact of the introduction of legislation akin to that envisaged in the Private Members' Bill and to that operating in the UK.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental working group completed its examination with commendable speed and submitted a detailed report of its deliberations in June 1999. In its report, which was published immediately by my Department, the group outlined its findings and made a number of important recommendations. It found that safety standards in the sector are generally high with little risk to the participants from the activities themselves. The evidence gathered suggested that the active combination of highly professional and safety conscious providers create a safe environment for most persons using the services of the providers. However the group found that there was a case for a form of statutory regulation of safety in adventure centre activities in Ireland and recommended that a statutory authority should be constituted to manage the regulatory scheme and to advise the appropriate Minister on all aspects of its set-up and operation. The working group recommended that the aim of the regulatory regime should be to encourage high safety standards, particularly in that part of the sector which has not participated in the existing voluntary inspection and approval scheme for providers of adventure activities established by the Association for Adventure Activities, the co-ordinating body for most of the national governing <Col N="637" /> bodies for adventure sports. This scheme, along with the Irish Sailing Association's independent scheme for recognised teaching establishments, has been the primary mechanism for establishing standards of safety at adventure centres and is mainly based on the qualifications of the staff working at the centres.</P>
    <P>The scheme is voluntary and provides an inspection, approval and spot checking system. However there are no sanctions available to force the inclusion of centres in it and a sizeable part of the adventure activities sector has opted to remain outside of the scheme and is not subject to close governing body control and approval. The working group was unable to gather sufficient information to draw conclusions on the danger or risk to persons using providers who operate outside the voluntary scheme but noted that below standard procedures, practice or management can often only come to light in the context of a serious accident followed by an inquiry and investigation. It took the view that there may well be provision of adventure activities on a commercial basis in Ireland which is not in accordance with accepted safety practices and which poses an undue risk to participants. It is to be expected that greater dangers to public health and safety occur in sectors or parts of sectors which are not subject to some form of external scrutiny or monitoring, either through statutory control or voluntary safety standards.</P>
    <P>The working group recommended that regulation should take the form of compulsory adherence to a set of safety codes in centres which would be required to notify or register with the statutory authority as providers of certain specified adventure activities. The statutory authority should in turn oversee an inspectorate which would visit and inspect all notified or registered centres, initially focusing on those which did not participate in the voluntary scheme and those which cater for children and young people. Significantly, the group proposed that the inspectorate would be entitled to direct centres which do not demonstrate adherence to the safety codes to cease providing activities.</P>
    <P>The group concluded that the sector encompassed by the current voluntary approval schemes probably does not require regulation as standards and internal safety ethos are high and are likely to remain so in the future through the current approach of standards setting, implementation and monitoring through the joint involvement of the national governing bodies and providers. However, the group pointed out that centres and providers who are outside the current voluntary schemes might well operate at less than adequate safety standards thereby exposing participants to unacceptable risk. It was for these reasons that the working group recommended that a statutory authority with responsibility for drawing up safety guidelines or codes for prescribed providers of adventure activities and for enforcing these guidelines should be established. In July 1999, the Government accepted in principle that <Col N="638" /> there was a need for a statutory regime to regulate safety in adventure centres and agreed that the development of this regime be progressed by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The Government also agreed that procedures be put in train to establish a new unit within my Department to deal with marine leisure and tourism, which includes this issue.</P>
    <P>In the interim, my Department provided grant-aid to the Association for Adventure Sports (AFAS) to enhance and extend the centre standards board (CSG) scheme of inspection of adventure activities providers' facilities. AFAS was also tasked by my Department with undertaking a wide-ranging consultation process amongst adventure activity centres and providers with a view to drawing up a blueprint for an inspection on which the new statutory authority could base its operations when established. The blueprint document was presented by AFAS in July 2000, and many of both the blueprint recommendations, and those of the interdepartmental working group, have been taken into account in the Bill while others are issues that the new authority can consider for itself when it is established.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, the Bill provides for the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority. The authority will have 15 members comprising of an independent chairperson, nominees from the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, my own Department, the Health and Safety Authority, four nominees from recognised national governing bodies for adventure activities, four nominees from adventure activity operators, and one nominee who shall be appointed on the basis of his or her knowledge, skills or experience as is considered appropriate for membership. After consultation with the authority the number of members, or the number of members that can be nominated by a person, or the persons who can nominate members can be varied. It is to be hoped that the inclusion of nominees from all of the areas mentioned will continue the teamwork approach that developed over the history of bringing this Bill before the House and carry forward the momentum towards a better safety environment in the adventure activities sector.</P>
    <P>The function of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority will be to promote, encourage, foster, facilitate and regulate the safe operation of adventure activities. To this end it will be empowered to administer schemes and grants, to procure or provide educational, training or advisory services and to carry out research. It will also advise me on matters relating to adventure activities. I will be able to confer additional functions on the authority, by way of order after consultation with the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a definition of adventure activities and 13 activities are covered by this definition. These are: hill-walking in areas more than 300 metres above sea level; orienteering in areas more than 300 metres above sea level; caving; dinghy sailing; kayaking; canoeing; surfing <Col N="639" /> with a surf board; wind-surfing; scuba-diving; snorkelling; abseiling; archery and rock climbing.</P>
    <P>Provision has been included to cater for the amendment to the definition of adventure activities, in consultation with the authority, by adding or deleting items from this list by Order. This procedure will follow a risk analysis of the relevant activity by the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a definition of an adventure activities operator as meaning a person who provides to members of the public for payment or reward: (a) training, instruction, supervision or leadership in an adventure activity; (b) facilities, including equipment for hire at a specified location, for the carrying on of an adventure activity, or (c) any two or more of the services specified previously at (a) and (b). Again, provision has been included to cater for amendment to this definition if necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, it will be mandatory for adventure activity operators to register with the authority in respect of specified adventure activities. The authority will develop codes of practice for specified adventure activities and it will be mandatory for adventure activity operators to abide by these codes. It will also introduce a regulatory scheme for specified adventure activities. This scheme will include the carrying out of inspections of operators by inspectors authorised by the authority. In certain circumstances, including non-compliance with a code of practice, the authority will have the power to direct an operator to suspend or cease the provision of specified adventure activities. It will also have the power to remove an adventure activity operator from the register of operators.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the definition of a provider in the Bill covers only those who provide adventure activities on a commercial basis. It does not cover schools or other educational establishments, which is a complex area. Schools do, in some instances, engage in adventure activities, but on an individual, local or preparatory level rather than a commercial basis. It has been agreed with the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children that, at this stage, the direct provision of adventure activities in schools to schoolchildren would not be included in the definition. This matter will, however, require further detailed investigation and it is proposed to leave this to the authority to examine after it has been established. New regulations would perhaps make schools, particularly the less well off ones, unwilling to undertake adventure activities. However, even though they are not covered by the Bill, it is anticipated that such institutions may wish to voluntarily adhere to the codes of practice the new authority will develop.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the authority will be able to investigate any accident, incident, occurrence or any other matter related to the general purposes of the Bill. The investigation will be conducted solely to establish the cause of such acci<Col N="640" /> dents and the adequacy of any codes of practice published or approved under this Bill with a view to recommending changes where appropriate. The authority will not have the power to direct an investigation into an accident at work, as this is covered under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, or into an accident in Irish waters, as this is covered under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, without my consent, given with the agreement of any other appropriate Minister. The purpose of the investigation will not be to attribute blame or fault but rather to produce a special report on the matter, however the authority will have the power to establish a tribunal of inquiry, with my consent, where it considers that such an action is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Adventure Activities Standards Authority will have the usual powers and duties regarding recruitment, salaries, superannuation and other financial matters relating to its proper functions as have other statutory authorities. In this regard it should be noted that the operation of the authority will involve a cost to the Exchequer, as any possible income it will receive from inspection fees will be limited and will not be sufficient to cover its costs. It is estimated that these costs could be in the region of £300,000 per year, for staff, agency payments, board expenses, promotion and lease of premises. Income will depend on the nature and format of the regulatory scheme developed or adopted by the authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Mr. Michael Davies who, following the death of his son Ros, campaigned to have a statutory safety regime in place for adventure activities in the hope that other parents would not have to suffer such a tragic loss. It is because of Mr. Davies' dedication that this Bill is now before this House. It was a sad and poignant occasion for me to meet Mr. Davies and to hear the details of the accident in which his son was lost. There is no question but that it was a life lost through carelessness. It is as a result of his dedication and his campaign that this legislation is before the House.</P>
    <P>I would also like to thank all of those who took part in the consultation process in the lead up to this Bill for the enthusiasm and commitment they have shown over the course of the entire process. There are far too many persons, clubs and organisations involved for me to name them all individually. However, I would like to acknowledge the work of the centre standards board and say a special thanks to the Association for Adventure Sports, for the diligence and dedication that they showed while undertaking, on my behalf, a wide ranging consultation process amongst adventure activity centres and providers on how the new authority should operate. This consultation process, which was conducted simultaneously with the legislation being drafted, considerably expedited the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware that regulation on its own cannot and will not address all of the safety issues <Col N="641" /> in the sector. In the final analysis, good and enduring safety practices can only be achieved, not by the authority, but by the people who provide the adventure activities on a day to day basis throughout the country. Everyone involved in the adventure activities sector must aim to make the prevention of accidents their top priority. Regulation must not be seen to in any way diminish the individual or organisational responsibility to at all times keep safety as their foremost priority.</P>
    <P>This legislation to establish a new authority to regulate adventure activities from a safety perspective is vital to the well-being of not alone the participants but to the sector as a whole. I hope that the good work undertaken to date by all interested parties, in a spirit of co-operation and partnership, will continue when the Bill is being debated in this House and in the Seanad. I look forward to the speedy enactment of the Bill and the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of this Bill by the Government owes its inspiration directly to a Private Members' Bill published in 1998 by Deputy Finucane who was, as he made clear at the time, pressing forward at the instigation of Mr. Michael Davies, to whom the Minister has referred. Deputy Finucane was the then spokesperson on the marine and his Bill was the first formulation of the need for a statutory approach to the regulation of adventure activities in the interests of public safety and in the interests of the quality of service being provided in such centres.</P>
      <P>While the report of the interdepartmental working group on the safety regulation of adventure activity centres in Ireland published in June 1999 points to the excellent safety record of adventure activity centres in Ireland which participate in their various sectoral organisations, it also makes the point that it is impossible to form any view on the safety or quality of services provided by centres which do not participate in any of the current voluntary schemes. Accidents involving tragic loss of life both in Ireland and in the UK in recent years pointed to the need for a consideration of public interest issues in these sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane came to the conclusion that a statutory approach was needed at the time he published his Bill in 1998 and when it was being debated in March 1999 the Government had not yet come to that conclusion. The Minister has indicated that the Government came to that conclusion in July 1999. I am glad the Government has decided to take that approach and that we are now debating a Bill which, in broad terms, we can support. It is proper and fair, and I am sure the Minister will agree, that the interdepartmental working group be commended on the quality and speed of its work. It has produced a thought provoking report and one which both benefits from the UK experience and takes a rather more incis<Col N="642" /> ive approach to dealing with the issues than seems to have been taken in the UK. It got to the target much more quickly than those in the UK. That is not a criticism of the UK but the group's report is a model of clarity in identifying the core issues with which we had to deal and I hope our debate will benefit considerably from that.</P>
    <P>It is commonly accepted that adventure activities make a significant contribution to tourism. That is true but there is more to it than that. Adventure activities also make a significant contribution to an appreciation of dimensions of our quality of life that are getting more attention and they help to play an exemplary role, that of giving an example, that would be useful in developing public attitudes to fitness and to health. There is a great deal more to the activities of adventure centres than first meets the eye.</P>
    <P>While I broadly welcome the Bill I have questions about its scope which I shall come to in a moment. There is also a substantial issue of principle to be dealt with, that is, the making of charges on adventure activity providers for the services set out in the Bill. That issue becomes one of particular concern when we have regard to the fact that the Health and Safety Authority, which plays a substantial role in workplaces all over the country, makes no charge for its services. I shall return to that issue later but I believe there is an important issue of principle to be dealt with. There are implications in the question of charging as pointed out in the interdepartmental committee's report and as referred to by the Minister when he spoke of schools that we should not lose sight of. When all those issues have been properly examined and concluded on, I look forward to having legislation in place with which we can be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will address some of the issues that arise when he concludes the Second Stage debate. It is clear that the function of the proposed authority is not one that could properly be given to the Health and Safety Authority which has an entirely different remit. How will this authority stand in relation to other safety agencies, for example, the National Safety Council and the Water Safety Authority? What kind of relationship does the Minister see between the work of the agency and those other agencies? </P>
    <P>The issue of charges is dealt with in section 20. There are a number of considerations about the question of charges in the interdepartmental working group's report. It states that:</P>
    <P>Charges should not be set at a level that would tend to push these activities underground. [That is perfectly understandable]. Equally they should not be set at a level that would create pressure on adventure centres to reduce the scope or the range of activities that they offer.</P>
    <P>For the sake of completeness we should add in the reflection that we should observe the principle that we should not kill the goose that lays the golden egg because an excessive level of <Col N="643" /> charges would choke off quite an amount of activity in the sector. There is the question of principle. What is being proposed is a measure in favour of the protection and the promotion of public safety. Other promotion functions are envisaged for the authority which I shall refer to later. The central reason for doing this is to promote public safety, to promote the safety of people who engage in adventure activities and to promote safety as a normal part of the ethos and operation of these centres. When I say that, the Minister knows I am not criticising those reputable centres in operation that are rightly identified in the report as having a perfectly good and serious ethos of safety. The function of this authority is to promote public safety in the same way as the function of the Health and Safety Authority is to promote safety in the public interest. That being the case, it is not obvious that there should be a charge. This is a service which we can rightly expect public authorities to provide. I cannot think of other cases offhand where we make a charge for public safety. We do not require our citizens to make a specific contribution to funding the Garda but it is done through our general taxation. It seems to me that general taxation is arguably the way to deal with the costs involved in putting this authority in place.</P>
    <P>I would assume, unless informed to the contrary, that operators would have to provide for the normal liability insurance for their operations. If I am wrong about that and they do not have to do it then they should be required to do it.</P>
    <P>Any operator providing a service to the public should be insured to the proper extent so that people do not take unnecessary risks even in areas not necessarily covered by the kind of provisions that are in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of the implications of the imposition of charges when he said: &ldquo;The group concluded that the sector encompassed by the current voluntary approval schemes probably does not require regulation as standards and internal safety ethos are high and are likely to remain so in the future through the current approach of standards setting, implementation and monitoring through the joint involvement of the national governing bodies and providers.&rdquo;  The Minister is saying that it can be argued that for those operators we do not need this provision but we are bringing it in just in case. For other operators we probably do need them. Given that the people who are currently operating to these standards as part of their ethos will continue to do so, it is not fair to make a new charge on them just because we set up another piece of State machinery with the inevitable bureaucracy that goes with it. I do not use the word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; in any pejorative sense. We have to put the machinery in place that goes with operating a service of this kind. There has to be a building and staff. People who already keep good safety and quality standards without an authority to oblige <Col N="644" /> them should not have to pay a charge to this new apparatus of State, imposed on them for the luxury of being allowed to continue to do so. There is no need for the State to look over its shoulder and tell them to do what they are doing already anyway. I am not opposed to the authority. I am arguing on a point of principle about people, who are already doing what we require them to do, now having to pay a charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to leave schools out of this for the moment, although there are some considerations that might argue for their inclusion in the scope of this. He said: &ldquo;New regulations would perhaps make schools, particularly the less well off ones, unwilling to undertake adventure activities.&rdquo;  What he seems to be saying is that the new regulations involving a charge might mean that schools, particularly the less well off ones, would be reluctant to undertake this because it would be another reason to have to go back to parents looking for a contribution to running the school. The Minister is saying that the very business of imposing a charge would possibly dissuade less well off schools from attempting to get their pupils involved in these adventure activities. The result would be that we would add another little twist to the screw of disadvantage for schools attended by pupils from lower income groups. This refers to disadvantaged schools in urban areas. Incidentally there are no advantages these days for disadvantaged schools in rural areas. Towns like Athy, for example, are considered rural areas for the definition of disadvantaged schools and they do not qualify. However that is a fish to fry with a different Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious that doing what he proposes might mean that disadvantaged schools in disadvantaged areas with economically disadvantaged pupils will again effectively be excluded from an area of activity that could be beneficial to the students. I know, as I am sure do many Members, that many children remember with some pleasure the odd excursion involving an adventure type activity. There are many children and adults who got their first introduction to an adventure activity while they were at school and then took it up afterwards with great benefit to their well-being. We should not run that risk, especially when this proposed charge is so suspect on grounds of principle.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with orders and regulations. Orders made under this Bill will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for active approval. I am delighted to see that. Regulations apparently will be made by this obnoxious passive procedure. I will return to that on Committee Stage when I have got a better grasp of the balance between orders and regulations. I do not expect that the Minister will agree with me, although he might surprise me as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did last year when he accepted some of my recommendations on other matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> The activities to be covered are outlined in section 8 of the Bill. The organisations involved in providing adventure activities want the activity of raft building to be included in the scope of the Bill. The Minister should tell us what he thinks of that. They also want to change the definitions given here of hill walking and orienteering. Instead of using a line of 300 metres above sea level, they propose to use a measure of remoteness from an access road. Again I would like to hear what the Minister thinks of that.</P>
    <P>A number of sports are not included in this, for example, equine pursuits. Is that because the Association of Irish Riding Establishments &ndash; AIRE &ndash; has a scheme that seems to be satisfactory in the context of what is proposed in the Bill or is there another reason?</P>
    <P>I note that parachuting is not included. Is that because it is regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority? Parachuting is a sport that has many passionate devotees, but it is also one where serious injuries can be and have been sustained and perhaps it is an area that needs to be considered. If I can be assured that it is properly regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority or some similar authority, I will accept that.</P>
    <P>I notice that bungee jumping is not included, although I have not heard that it is an activity that is widely offered here. It is a sport that appals me. I have seen people bungee jumping and I found it difficult to watch. I know that the people who do it get an enormous kick out of it &ndash; I do not know if anyone in the House has tried it. There were times when being a member of Fianna Fáil was a bit like bungee jumping. They could never be quite sure when they were going to hit the bottom. The Bill also includes a provision whereby additions can be made to this list. I would like to know why the specific ones that I have mentioned have not been included.</P>
    <P>I note also that the activities that are normally carried on, for example, in local authority swimming pools do not seem to be included. Is that because we are happy that they are all properly covered by insurance or by standards of quality, conduct or safety, is it just an inadvertent omission or is it simply a decision to leave out that part of the public sector? I would like the Minister to tell us the reason for what seems to be an omission.</P>
    <P>Why is only the provision of activities, training, etc., for payment and reward covered? Is there a reason for not covering activities not provided for payment or reward? The Minister said he has some hesitation in relation to schools and sectors where such things are voluntarily provided, but it seems that if we are concerned with safety in general we should include these activities whatever the circumstances in which they are carried out.</P>
    <P>The operators in the field have indicated they do not believe it is correct to bring the hire of equipment within the scope of the Bill on the basis that the equipment should conform with the relevant safety criteria and that they cannot reasonably be held to have specific liability for <Col N="646" /> equipment of the correct standard. Perhaps this is not a complete argument or presentation of the case and I would like to know if there is a specific reason the hire of equipment is included in addition to the offering of training and activities.</P>
    <P>Section 14 states that among the functions of the authority, quite apart from regulation, will be the promotion, encouragement, fostering and facilitation of adventure activities. That may well be a good thing, but this is a public authority which will look after the interests of public safety. Why should we give the authority the duty of promoting, encouraging, fostering and facilitating these activities? The Irish Aviation Authority, for example, does not have as part of its remit the promotion, encouragement, fostering or facilitation of air travel or flying for pleasure. These activities are more properly a matter for the operators than for an authority charged with regulating activities. How does the Minister see the functions of promotion and facilitation falling in with regulation? I know that in every sector where there is a regulator the operators in that sector will start giving out saying the regulator is going about its job in a way that makes it nearly impossible for them to develop their sector &ndash; we could all write the script for that argument, which is sometimes justified and which we have heard many times. It is not obvious why these functions of promotion, facilitation, etc., should go with the process of regulation.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of odd provisions in the Bill relating to the director and members of the authority. The Bill, including the Schedule, proposes to give the Minister power to dismiss the director or any member of the authority without giving a reason, which is rather odd. I am not sure I have seen such power being given to a Minister in other legislation. I am not accusing the Minister of bad faith or of being any more irredentist and benighted than is the general run in Fianna Fáil and the Government, but I do not know why he should want this absolute power without giving any reason. I am further puzzled by it given that it is proposed that four members of the authority will be nominated, proposed or suggested by the operators. Why would the Minister want to fire one of these without giving a reason? Can I be told of any other authority or body of this kind in the public sector where the Minister has power to fire the director or a member without giving a reason?</P>
    <P>I have examined the Bill very carefully. There is such provision in other legislation, but usually the power to fire is on the basis of stated misbehaviour or for some specific reason. I do not think I have ever seen a provision that a person duly appointed a member or director of such an authority can be fired by a Minister without giving a reason. I am not saying a Minister would do so for no reason, but when a Minister is given such an unfettered power, it can be used for a reason which is not respectable, and I worry about having such provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> Section 33 provides for registration. It seems a person who is already in the business, who will be when the Bill comes into effect, or who wants to set up in the business, simply has to inform the authority that they want to be registered as a provider of a service and that person is then registered. I want to be sure I have understood this correctly. Is this the only process which has to be gone through? I am not saying that is the only obligation &ndash; there is a question of regulation.</P>
    <P>Why does section 35 provide that the authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; regulate things? The purpose of setting up this process is that the authority will regulate the sector. A constant argument in the House, particularly on slow afternoons, involves Opposition Deputies asking why a Bill does not include &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;. However, I am really puzzled by the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this case as it seems there is not much point in having this Bill and the associated new bureaucracy in place if the authority will not be obliged to do something and have a function. Why does the section contain this permissive rather than an obligatory formulation?</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up a system of inspections and inspectors. There is an odd provision which says a person who is not an inspector may nevertheless inspect, and I will go into this in some detail on Committee Stage. When we set up a system of inspections and inspectors we need to be sure the process is fair and is seen to be fair, and that there is some basis on which the people being inspected can argue. A fault with the Bill is that there is no provision for an appeal against the decision of an inspector which obliges somebody to stop doing something. I see nothing in the Bill which gives me objective confidence that the people who will carry out the inspections will know what they are doing or be in any way skilled or knowledgeable about the area they will be inspecting. One person said to me they do not want to be inspected by an inspector who stands on the top of the nearest hill and has a look over the operation.</P>
    <P>Will inspectors be given a means of identification which includes a photograph? I have asked this in relation to every Bill which concerns inspectors being sent out to do a job on behalf of the State. This ensures people who have to maintain certain standards in order to earn their living know that the person who turns up on their doorstep saying they are an inspector is the same as the person whose photograph is on the identification produced. Does the Minister intend to do this?</P>
    <P>An issue which has been brought to my attention is that there was an understanding during the consultations which took place that two of the four people appointed to the authority to represent the operators would come from the private sector operators and two would come from the public sector operators. For understandable reasons, the operators have taken the view that this is important. They do not see this aspect reflected in the Bill and they are anxious that it <Col N="648" /> should be made explicit in the Schedule and, if necessary, in the sections dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>Subject to the various questions I have raised being answered satisfactorily, I am pleased the Bill has been introduced and I hope that at the end of this discussion we can be confident of making a substantial contribution to public safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000. I wish to put on the record that I supported the Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Finucane, when he was spokesman on the marine. He deserves credit for doing so and I agree with Deputy Dukes that he was partly responsible for moving the issue forward in a positive way. He did so as a result of consultations following the tragedy which occurred in Dunmore East, County Waterford, when it was felt that more comprehensive legislation would be required. I am pleased to be in a position to support this Bill because, together with the canoeing accident in Dunmore East, there was an accident in Dunany in my constituency when a number of young people were lost because their boat was overcrowded and as far as I can ascertain, there were no safety precautions in place.</P>
      <P>This leads me to a number of questions, some of which have already been referred to by Deputy Dukes. Why are certain activities such as fishing excluded from the Bill? Perhaps it is covered by a different organisation. I do quite a bit of fishing in the west and many people in that region and the south earn part of their livelihood by hiring out boats for rod fishing and other fishing activities on lakes and rivers. I am not aware of regulations in this regard or whether those who provide this very useful service to the tourism industry are legally obliged to abide by certain safety standards when hiring and leasing boats for fishing activities.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Dukes's point in regard to schools in disadvantaged areas. If there is a charge for such activities, it would mean there would be no provision for those who are the least well off and who could effectively be deprived of leisure activities. The OEI made it clear in its recommendations that there should be no charge whatsoever. Deputy Dukes made the point that people who are currently applying good safety standards may be asked to pay for what they are doing. I would be more in favour of going after those who are not performing their functions in accordance with the regulations introduced under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to removing operators from the register. What does that mean? If a register is set up under the legislation will people be required to register and if they do not comply with the regulations, can they be removed from the register? Does this mean that if they are removed from the register because they do not comply with the regulations they cannot perform the activity, in other words, they will be put out <Col N="649" /> of business? Simply removing them from the register and allowing them to operate without complying with the regulations will achieve no purpose. The opposite will be the case. This would have a completely negative effect. I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by removing someone from the register. Who will be in charge of the register and how will one apply to get on it? Will it be compulsory to register? Will a planning application for permission to operate certain activities require local authorities to ensure these people are registered, have made an application to register or have a certificate to the effect that they are obliged to conduct their activities in accordance with the regulations?</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the section in the Bill which allows for the adding of activities. We frequently see on television all sorts of new leisure activities, some of which will probably end up on the Olympic agenda. These activities are too numerous to mention. Will it be up to organisations which start activities such as bungee jumping and so on to apply to the authority for a certificate or to get on the register? What incentive will the Minister include in the regulations to encourage people to register? Will it mean, for example, that no grants will be made available for sporting or tourism activities if people are not listed on the register? There must be an incentive for those who register and a deterrent for those who do not. Those who do not register will probably be the people who will break the rules, as is the case in all sorts of activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a supporter of social partnership before its latest manifestation in 1987 and in terms of the understanding of a wider social wage and contributing to our social and economic progress, it has been an important development in Irish industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The cement of social partnership has been pay restraint. In today's environment after almost a decade of economic growth, this cement is no longer adequate. This does not mean that social partnership ought to be abandoned. Rather it means that what is encompassed by social partnership and expressed in social pacts must be refined and expanded. Performance and reward must become key factors. Investment in training and upskilling, in manpower planning and human resource development and child care provision must be given higher priority.</P>
      <P>Tax changes, in combination with pay increases, may help resolve living standards but do not address relative differences in a dynamic society. It is right that modern Irish workers have higher aspirations than their progenitors but, if these aspirations are to be met, productivity increases and change must be faced up to, and not just in certain sectors of the economy. Social investment must continue to have the highest priority. Housing need alone is probably a key driver of unrest in the modern industrial workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If social partnership is to survive, it requires careful management and guidance. It has largely been abandoned by the Government, other than in times of high tension. There has been no functioning Minister for Labour during the lifetime of this Government. Access by the social partners in times of conflict is directly to the office of the Taoiseach or to the Taoiseach himself. There is no adequate nurturing of the process, nobody with hands-on political responsibility, nobody looking around corners for problems coming down the track, nobody anticipating difficulties that might easily have been foreseen, nobody involving the main players in developing the concept of social partnership. There are grave dan<Col N="651" /> gers if the perception is allowed to develop that social partnership is only for the lead players and is of lesser relevance to the daily needs of the workplace.</P>
    <P>The strains and stresses now manifesting themselves in the social partnership process are hardly surprising, against a background of neglect of that process and in the context of a period of the most dramatic and unprecedented change. We have become a net importer of labour. The workforce has expanded rapidly, there have been enormous improvements in productivity and we have had almost a decade of unprecedented growth. All those have produced their own peculiar pressures and tensions. Huge infrastructural deficits have been exposed but less remarked on are the deficits in human resource management and practices. The old one-company loyalty has gone out the window and workers are functioning in an environment of increasing materialism and individualism. If trade union members were to emulate some of the practices being exposed on the part of their employers, this economy would not function at its current rate. Meanwhile there is enormous pressure on a public service still unable to shake off the archaic practices of a more hierarchical era. There is still a refusal to invest sufficiently in human resource development. The public sector and much of the private sector still fail to recognise that people-quality is a key factor in maintaining social and economic progress.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, generally speaking, we have over recent years had fewer demarcation disputes than used to be the pattern. There generally has been commonsense respect for the congress procedures. Too much significance can be attached to a couple of high profile disputes that have developed a definite inter-union dimension. These are very probably a symptom of deeper problems in the sectors affected. If Government pleads inability to become involved, there is no bar to their becoming involved belatedly in the underlying endemic problems neglected for so many years. Some of the other disputes adverted to in this debate highlight the need for renovation of social partnership.</P>
    <P>I have heard and seen foolish and presumably mischievous comment on the broadcasting media about the supposed comparison that can be drawn between anti-competitive practices in business and anti-competitive practices in trade unions, meaning that competition, that is, several unions in a single employment, is a good thing. This is utter nonsense and betrays no understanding of the origins, practices or purpose of the trade union movement. Workers have no vested interest in representative fragmentation and most certainly managements have no desire to have to do business with several unions for the same category of worker.</P>
    <P>As someone who has supported and continues to support the need to remunerate teachers, commensurate with their critical contribution to society, I have been puzzled at the apparent <Col N="652" /> unwillingness to face up to necessary change as the <i>quid pro quo</i> for decent salaries. Therefore I supported the benchmarking process at the outset as a rational method to bring both necessary change and appropriate reward to different categories of employee throughout the public sector. However, I now worry that the process of benchmarking has been undermined and devalued by some of the public comment, including by Cabinet Ministers, and that there is a danger that it has been relegated now to the status of yet another dispute-resolution mechanism.</P>
    <P>The reputation of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, during his term as Minister for Labour is justified, even if I recall that his ability for timely intervention when others had done the spadework was his hallmark. Regrettably the Government has been trading on that reputation while withdrawing from the current industrial relations environment. The chickens are now in danger of coming home to roost and unless there is a change of approach, the next Government will inherit a legacy of neglect, alienation and unrest that will threaten social and economic progress.</P>
    <P>My central point is that the process of social partnership requires nurturing, leadership and development. There has to be a Minister with political hands-on responsibility for the industrial relations portfolio. There has been no Minister for labour functioning during the lifetime of this Government. As a result, the present manifestation of an outbreak of problems in different areas threatens the very continuation of social partnership.</P>
    <P>Of course, social partnership is also threatened by the present inflationary environment. Workers who signed off for what looked like a reasonably good agreement, when taken in the context of tax reform as well as moderate pay increases, now find themselves in an ongoing inflationary spiral. The Minister for Finance and his Department told us that this was a temporary blip which would not continue throughout the lifetime of the PPF It now looks like continuing. In the context of our living in one of the highest priced economies in the European Union, it is easy to see why so many workers in so many different employments are concerned about current developments. Having regard to the inability of young people in reasonable employment to put a roof over their heads, it is not at all surprising that we have the unrest which is now emerging in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The occasional, nowadays infrequent, inter-union dispute ought not to be taken as the norm. Provided there is hands-on political direction and leadership, social partnership can be renovated in such a fashion that, whatever the hue of the next Government, it can be continued as the cornerstone of economic policy but not at the rate that it is rapidly going downhill at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. It gives me an opportunity to outline the many positive <Col N="653" /> policies being pursued by the Government. It is an indication of the success of the Government that, in referring to various issues, previous speakers, including Deputy Rabbitte, suggest they almost support the Government's amendment. Those issues are the high growth rates, low unemployment, tax cuts, the fact that 1.8 million are working and the huge amount of jobs continually being created. Definitely there are many positive aspects to what the Government has achieved.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the problem of industrial unrest. One of the reasons we have an element of industrial unrest is that we inherited, from a poor period in the early 1980s, massive debt, high unemployment and massive emigration and then suddenly moved to a form of social partnership which has helped to transform the country. Nobody in this Chamber could condemn the positive aspects of social partnership and what it has contributed to our economy.</P>
      <P>As a person who left second level school in the mid-1980s, I distinctly remember many friends and colleagues having to leave the country to find work. That continued right into the early 1990s. People talk about the Celtic tiger. I am concerned that young people feel that the Celtic tiger has been around forever. It is only in the past five or six years that it has impacted on the whole of society and we still have a way to go in certain areas. The generation younger than me seems to have the view that the Celtic tiger was always there because they do not remember the dark days of the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The Opposition is trying to highlight the issue of industrial unease. If we wanted to be negative we could highlight a few of the industrial disputes that have taken place. There is the argument, however, that social partnership has worked and should be supported by all. It would be disingenuous of us to try to remove ourselves now from social partnership. The Government has been very supportive of social partnership, which was founded by the Fianna Fáil Party in the late 1980s. This Government is committed to partnership and working with members of trade unions which see its benefits. Where there are difficulties within the framework of social partnership, industrial relations machinery is available to address grievances, either through the Labour Court or through the benchmarking process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would encourage all unions to look at the positive aspects of the benchmarking process and I reject the criticism that the process has been undermined because of comments by Ministers. It is independent and I am confident that when it reports and assesses the pay of people in the public sector, they will be content with the result. The ASTI and others who have concerns should now come on board and see the positive aspects of benchmarking and social partnership. It has created huge employment across every strata of our economy. If unions walk away or are not supported by Government and Opposition, we will find ourselves back in the dark days. As a 33 year <Col N="654" /> old, partnership has made a difference to me and my peers.</P>
    <P>The success of this economy has of course brought problems too. There is a huge number of people returning to the country and we have an infrastructural deficit, acknowledged by the Government, which has published the national development plan to try to address these issues. We must accept that we have come from a very low base and up to a few years ago there were public spending cuts rather than increases. We have a lot to make up to get to where we should be but the national development plan is positive and when it comes to full fruition we will see dynamic change with regard to the problems outlined. Road structure, investment in public transport etc. will improve enormously and everyone will benefit. That is another reason everybody with influence should strive to ensure that the most important pillar of the success of our economy, the social partnership, is supported and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Some people say that central pay bargaining is an anathema to a free economy. I reject that. It is important that we have a system that protects the rights of workers and a procedure to address grievances and to guarantee that incomes are protected from inflationary pressures. Most trade unionists, employers and the Government accept that this is the way forward.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty for young people in terms of housing. Union representatives highlight the fact that many double income families are unable to purchase a home. That is something we have to address because if we do not address the underlying problem it could have serious repercussions and a ripple effect right across the social partnership. We have invested huge amounts of funding through various initiatives to open land for development. The pressure on the economy and on the whole construction industry to meet the demand must be addressed. An increase in public spending, particularly in infrastructural development, will have a knock-on effect in increasing the pressure already on the construction industry to meet a house-building target of 60,000 houses a year to address the present housing deficit.</P>
    <P>All in all, over the next few months some of the disputes raised in this motion will be resolved. Those who have a grievance can use the industrial machinery available to address their problems. It is important that employers accept that they have a fundamental duty to ensure that social partnership is supported and that it will continue. It disappoints me to hear of employers paying less than the minimum wage, paying cash under the counter and not ensuring that workers' entitlements and contributions are fully paid. I am particularly concerned about employers who use or abuse persons who have entered this country either legally or illegally. It is scurrilous that people who have migrated here are sometimes paid less than the minimum wage. That is an abuse of the system and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Overall, this motion is timely because it gives us an opportunity to highlight the many positive aspects of what this Government has achieved. On this 75th birthday of the party, we can look back and point out the proud tradition of service to the country. Since 1987 the concept of partnership has encouraged all sectors to come together to address the problems of our economy. I congratulate the Government and others for moving forward with social partnership.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure for me to support the Government's economic policies. From a backbencher's point of view, I could not have an easier task than to speak for ten minutes on the issue. I genuinely extend my sympathies to Fine Gael and the Labour Party who have to speak against the Government on this issue. They are scraping the barrel most Wednesdays trying to find a motion to embarrass the Government, but they hit a new low tonight in putting up a spurious motion on real or imagined industrial disputes which, in some way, says that the Government is causing inflation, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is a matter of working the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to its fulfilment and when we do that there will be improvements for everyone.</P>
      <P>We must ask where the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness came from. In 1987, when Fianna Fáil came back into Government, it brought about the innovative, first social partnership Programme for National Recovery. It was the first of its kind in Europe and was the envy of member states. They cannot believe that we are so successful in achieving national agreements voluntarily without legislation. National consensus and co-operation is the way forward, not conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent the 1990s creating employment and will spend the next decade improving the infrastructure. We will be remembered for, in these three decades, clearing the national debt, increasing employment and improving the infrastructure &ndash; simple, basic and to the point. We delivered and will continue to do so. In 1987, when we came to power, there was 1.1 million in the workforce, and there is 1.8 million today, which is a testimony to the Government's policies. How anyone on the other side of the House can find fault in a situation where 700,000 more people are in the workforce is beyond comprehension. I am proud of that record.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that inflation can be the by-product of a prosperous economy. However, inflation would be higher were it not for the Government's actions. Inflation might be out of control if we had not been so diligent in managing the national finances. The key element of that was the pay deals. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the latest version of the original Programme for National Recovery. We brought about the biggest single reduction in income tax rates and cut indirect taxes and fuel prices in the recent budget. Above all, we introduced a concept that had gone out of date in encouraging people to save instead of squandering money unnecessarily. I hope that will lead to a culture change.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of the current programme is the national implementation body, whose job is to ensure industrial stability. It will work with the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission. They are achieving progress. I am most concerned about the public service benchmarking body. It is the way of the future. It is independent, under the chairmanship of a judge. Everybody in the House, employers, trade unions and the voluntary sector will say what they think it should do, but it will make its own decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the frustration in the public service. People feel that they are not getting a fair share of the Celtic tiger. The reason is that the extra 700,000 in the workforce are the principal beneficiaries of the booming economy. The benchmarking body should commission a detailed actuarial valuation of employment in the public sector <i>versus </i>the private sector. A public sector job is for life and a value should be attributed to that. A private sector job may be for life or a year. There is a risk that is not in the public service. In prosperous times, pay rates are higher in the private sector but in a recession public service <Col N="657" /> jobs are secure. The benchmarking body should conduct detailed research into this and take into account a fair balance between job security and pay rates. If it makes recommendations in this area, it will not only set the scene in this social partnership agreement but will be the cornerstone for any new agreement, which our party in government will, I hope, steer through.</P>
    <P>Employee share option schemes in semi-State bodies is another measure implemented by the Government. Employees have a 15% option in the ACC and ICC banks and in Eircom. There is legislation to give employees shares in the ESB, to work for a programme for change to make it more adaptable in the modern economy. They will be able to buy additional shares, giving them a reasonable shareholding in the ESB and a stake in its future.</P>
    <P>Some ill-informed comment was made about introducing legislation to ensure stability in essential services. Anybody who thinks along those lines is misguided, misinformed and does not understand the situation or the psyche of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will not introduce legislation compelling people to stay in work when they have a legitimate grievance and a right to strike. That right cannot be taken away. Anyone who thinks that industrial relations can be run through the Four Courts misunderstands the people. I oppose that idea.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking and the implementation body will bring the present national understanding to success. These innovations are the way forward and will survive the next decade bringing benefits to people in the public and private sectors. Inflation is decreasing. Some is home grown. I criticise retailers, builders and publicans who take advantage of the booming economy to put up prices and increase profits. This adds to inflation and causes problems for everyone. I commend the Government's economic policies. We are doing a good job, on target for our fifth budget which will be delivered on the first Wednesday in December. I look forward to continuing prosperity under a Fianna Fáil led Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up a point raised by Deputy Fleming about the use of Private Members' time on this and other motions. Over the past few months especially, this time has been a whinging session for the main Opposition parties. Instead of promoting their own policies and <Col N="658" /> encouraging constructive debate, they whinge about what the Government is or is not doing. It does not make for good political debate and it shows a deficit on the Opposition benches in regard to good sound policies. I said a number of months ago that the Opposition is increasingly coming across as an Opposition in a coma rather than a Government in waiting. That has been underlined here every Tuesday and Wednesday night. There is nothing constructive coming from that side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Government policies in the area of the economy have been extremely successful and very far reaching. The agreements with the Government and the successful national agreement in which we are now involved have brought this country from a period of slow economic progress to where we are progressing quite rapidly in national development. Every sector is now involved. The rising tide has lifted the boats of almost everyone in this country and we are now moving forward. Looking at the comment from our European colleagues, it is quite obvious that we are the envy of Europe. The Minister for Finance is to be complimented on the stand he has taken both at home in terms of our economic policies and abroad in defending our position and ensuring that our economic success is held up as a model for all other European countries to follow.</P>
      <P>Our growth rate has been 10% per annum over the past four years. It is four times higher than the European Union average. That speaks for itself. Let us focus on some of the issues. The main issue in terms of economic policy is the challenge for all of us to understand the change taking place within our economy, to master that change and to move forward. We also have to be conscious that we need to understand the expectations of the public. We need to understand that some of those expectations will not be reached and that some of them are unrealistic. We need to understand that we cannot be too excessive in our ambitions for the development of this economy. We need to move forward at a steady pace and to bring every sector of the economy with us. We need to ensure we do not run into inflationary problems. We had a problem with inflation which ran at 7% but because of the measures introduced by the Government, the rate of inflation has been reduced to 5.6% in April. That has to be recognised. It is not just a political fact; it is an economic fact and an undisputed one. If that is the case, then our economic policies are successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Members cared to look at any of the marginalised communities, which exist in most constituencies, they will see the investment by this Government has resulted in their inclusion in terms of education and advancement in their careers and employment and in terms of skills in the areas of information technology and communications. That has only come about because this Government has recognised where the shortfalls are and is anxious to move in and bring forward investment and proper pro<Col N="659" /> grammes to be supported over a number of years and not just one year. A number of these programmes run for five years and success has been recorded there. This year alone there have been record increases in employment. The figures forecast have been increased further by 60,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>We are not blind to the fact that a number of areas need attention. One of those areas which requires attention concerns the deficit in terms of local government and the infrastructure being provided. Given the amount of money that has been invested through local government in terms of the national development plan, it is obvious that a commercial outlet or activity would not be able to take on that amount of money at the drop of a hat and spend it immediately.</P>
    <P>Staff in local government and the Civil Service are constantly being head hunted by the private sector. We have a booming private sector which defeats the argument of those opposite. As regards civil servants and local government officials, all we need to do is to bring in a system where they are benchmarked. That too is catered for in our economic policies but we need to fast track it and to ensure that those who are employed in our local government and Civil Service are well paid because there are good, honest people working in that service and young people who are anxious to get on and participate in the development of this country, implement the national development plan and spend the money which this Government has put in place. I encourage the Minister for Finance to do whatever he can to ensure the benchmarking process is fast tracked and that the people employed as regards the national development plan strategy at local level &ndash; those in the planning areas, engineers and senior executives in local government &ndash; are paid as quickly as possible given the new salaries required by comparison with the private sector. That is the only way we will get them to stay and will get the highly educated young people to take an interest in the Civil Service and particularly in local government because that is where the spend is directed.</P>
    <P>If we deliver in terms of infrastructure, then we are supporting local economies, the development of the regions and the infrastructure nationally which will ensure the local, regional and national economies are served to the best of our ability. That is one of the areas which requires action.</P>
    <P>As regards the strike issues raised by the Opposition, every commercial activity goes through a restructuring from time to time. This has not ever been more necessary than in regard to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta or any other company one may wish to name. Companies need to be modernised and brought up to what is required in commercial terms in a developing economy which is well financed and driven by this Government. That is all that needs to happen. When that takes places &ndash; the structures exist within the PPF to make that change take place and to assist it &ndash; one will find that each and every one of those <Col N="660" /> companies will be better structured, leaner and well capable of dealing with the economic changes put before them in terms of the delivery of their services, because that too is an issue. We have to deliver a far greater service now. Given the Nice Treaty and the enlargement of the European Union, there is a definite need for every operation in this country to be lean and competitive, whether it is under State control or is a commercial operation. All that is happening in Aer Lingus, which the Opposition mentioned, and in other organisations is that they are growing up, moving on, facing the challenge and resolving the difficulties that have existed within them for quite some time.</P>
    <P>My only concern is that during the course of this change which is taking place, particularly in those companies, the only ones to suffer are the customers and the country as a whole. There needs to be a review of the mechanism within the PPF to ensure that what was agreed within the partnership between the Government and the unions is adhered to because it is in the interest of the economy and not just one section of it or one company. There is a need to focus our attention on ensuring that all the mechanisms within that structure which has been agreed are adhered to and that the change can be structured and can take place without the hassle and trauma created by a number of these strikes for the consumer. I support the economic policies spelled out yearly by the Minister for Finance. The closer we stick to those policies &ndash; another budget will be introduced this year &ndash; the greater the success of this economy and every sector within it.</P>

It is important to raise one issue in relation to Eircom, which is now privatised under this Government, the public having bought shares and paid into the State coffers so that could be done. Now Eircom is closing telephone kiosks throughout the country in many rural areas, kiosks which have been used by the elderly, the poor, children trying to contact home, etc. I hope, given that the Minister of State has responsibility for the elderly, that he will contact Eircom which is now a private company&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and have this decision overturned rather than turning his back on the people of rural Ireland, because that should have been written in before the company was sold off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a head of steam building up in the public sector which has been highlighted by the <Col N="661" /> recent industrial unrest and disputes. We are witnessing the crumbling of partnership agreements and the destruction of the national consensus which has been the foundation of our current economic prosperity. We are facing a return to the serious industrial unrest experienced in the 1970s and 1980s when Ireland had one of the worst industrial relations records in the developed world. Today, however, we are facing industrial unrest in the public rather than in the private sector. We are still working with an archaic system of management and government, and without an efficient well run public sector, our prosperity will soon decline.</P>
    <P>The current situation can be resolved only by good management and partnership both within the public sector and within Government. This very day large sections of the IMPACT trade union, the State's second largest public sector trade union which has over 40,000 members, expressed opposition to social partnership in its current form. This is a union that voted four to one in favour of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness just over a year ago.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday, 100,000 commuters were left stranded by Iarnród Éireann. The response of the Minister for Public Enterprise was that it was not her problem. On Wednesday, train services to the south were paralysed and on Thursday the west was badly hit. Again, the Minister failed to become involved and did not appoint a mediator in relation to this dispute. The leadership that is so badly needed is not present either in the Taoiseach or in the Minister for Public Enterprise. The Taoiseach refuses to take tough decisions, and this permeates right throughout the Government to the various Ministers and their Departments, whose different sectoral areas cover the industrial chaos which has now broken out.</P>
    <P>Questions also have to be raised about the running of the industrial disputes in Aer Lingus. In early April, employees of the ESB warned that there would be strikes unless the Government conceded a 28% pay increase. Within days the Government and the company had conceded a 20% increase. We have also had disputes in the nursing profession, in the Garda Síochána, and the teachers' dispute is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said recently that wage moderation and tax reform were fundamental to the State's economic performance, but the public and our workforce also demand a first rate health service and proper infrastructure. We still do not have a proper health service. Not only are public patients but private patients are queueing for beds. We do not have the social services. We do not have infrastructure in place. We have heard speaker after speaker from the opposite side of the House talk about fast tracking. We do not even have tracks in relation to Luas in Dublin yet, even though it has been announced on numerous occasions. Our education system is crumbling and bursting at the seams.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing to have to raise these issues but it is our duty to do so. We would like to be able to put forward our very many positive policies, but we must deal with the Government's inactivity first and try to get it on the right track</P>
      <P>At a time of unprecedented wealth and prosperity, 215,587 man days were lost in 1999 through industrial disputes. Last year things were a little better with 100,000 man days lost through industrial disputes. One would have to go back a fair number of years to find a record like that. Most of these man days were lost in the public sector, and today a union representative spoke about the quality of life and the quality of services provided to citizens. The Government is blinkered and talks about nothing but the economy. It has lost its way, and it is up to us to get it back on track or to get it out of office and do the job ourselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fleming was not very generous in his comments when he talked about the turnaround in 1987. He did not allude to the fact that without the Tallaght Strategy that could not have happened. He did not allude to the fact that it was unprecedented generosity on the part of the Opposition that enabled the Government of the day to undo the mess of decades caused mainly by Fianna Fáil. Now I do not want to go into history but if a Deputy opposite takes credit for the progress made since 1987, he should at least be generous and honest enough to acknowledge the role of the party that was on this side of the House at the time and without whom it could not have happened. It was totally unprecedented. So let us take the blinkers off and be honest about it.</P>
      <P>We are concentrating on the public sector because of the problems being experienced. For the first time in the history of the State, nurses went on strike. They had a conference and are planning a strategy for further industrial action because they are unhappy with the way they are being treated by Government. The last thing they want is to go on strike. However, because of the inept policies of the Government, they are forced to do so.</P>
      <P>On the question of benchmarking, nobody seems to know what it is all about. Different people have different interpretations of it. Obviously it involves some form of extra payment, but will it be linked to pensions? I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance has come into the House. Perhaps he can answer that question. Will benchmarking be reflected in people's pension entitlements later on? I would like clarification on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial disputes in the public sector are bad for our image abroad. A strike in Dublin Airport creates a very bad image for the country. If people cannot leave the country, if they cannot get a taxi or a train, if there is uncertainty about any of those things, that creates a bad impression. If people get sick and have to go to hospital and have to wait on a trolley or perhaps even a trolley <Col N="663" /> cannot be found on which to put them, that is a problem. If there is a strike in school, that is a problem for children. If there is a danger that power will be disrupted and the lights might go out, that creates a bad reflection. All these problems in the industrial area in the public sector are being monitored abroad, and they do our image no good. l call on the Government, therefore, to take note of what IMPACT and other unions are saying and to really look at the partnership model and accept that it has to evolve and change with the times. What people are crying out for across the country now are better public services. They want quality of life improved, and that is something the Government will have to get to grips with.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy McGuinness on his speech. He touched on the need to enhance the careers of people working in the public sector. We know, for instance, that planners are leaving local authorities and that there is a major bottleneck in planning right across the country. Unless we do something to enhance the careers of those people and make their jobs more attractive and less stressful, the problem will get worse.</P>
    <P>We need to be careful because of the possibility of an economic downturn. Interest rates in America have been cut a number of times in order to try to boost the economy there. If the economy there goes into a nosedive or gets into trouble, we will be in trouble here as well. It is very important that we take note of that and insulate ourselves against such a shock. It is important we all work to ensure that industrial unrest in the public sector is dealt with and that those working in that sector can find satisfaction in their jobs. There is an opportunity over the summer to deal with the problems in the teaching sector. People will leave teaching if we do not.</P>

      <P>There are serious stresses and strains in social partnership. That is quite clear and was illustrated on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today by Peter McLoone when he outlined his concerns. This motion is clear in that it calls the Government to account for these stresses and strains and we are asking the Government to examine its role in those strains.</P>
      <P>This is a quality of life issue for our citizens because it affects the public services that are available to people. We all know about the stresses in the health services. We have seen teachers on strike. We know that 100,000 people could not get trains last week. We know people are being held up in airports. We see these problems week in, week out and I would have been more impressed if Government speakers had acknowledged what is going on in a more open way. People would be more reassured if there was an acknowledgement of the reality and a discussion about how the Government intends to address that reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls the Government to account and there is no doubt that the disputes listed, in <Col N="664" /> Aer Lingus, among teachers, in the CIE group and the ESB, among nurses and doctors and in the clerical grades of the Civil Service, are very serious and are undermining a process that has helped the country enormously and that has provided the base for much of the economic success we are enjoying as a nation. These are the only cases where the Government is the only other partner as both the employer and as Government. In the State sector the social partners are the workers and their unions, the employers, Ministers and the Government. This is an important point when looking at partnership in the public sector. We must focus on how the Government does its business and the question we must ask is how is the Government managing its relationship with its partners &ndash; its own workforce? How are the Government and Ministers actually managing the State and public sector and their relationships within that? </P>
    <P>There is now a huge focus on hiring outside management consultancy firms, costing millions of pounds, to investigate and advise. If one listens carefully to Ministers they often say they will decide what they will do when told by the experts. So, if things subsequently go wrong, do not work out, or cost more than initially planned the Government is off the hook. While this is going on the public sector workforce knows the entire sector is being examined, assessed, reassessed and reviewed by consultancy firms; in effect, they are almost stalked by consulting firms and I make that claim against the Government as opposed to the consulting firms. Look at the delays with Luas in the transport sector and the number of consultants' reports. Look at Aer Lingus. Look at Eircom and how badly thousands of people lost out there when we know what was paid to the consultants concerned. Hiring consultants gives Ministers a foil, something to hide behind. It keeps Government decision making away from parliamentary scrutiny and comment and costs a fortune.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues have referred to how demoralised public sector workers are, at managerial level in particular. Ministers are not managing their departmental functions. Consultants should never replace ordinary managerial decision making but that is what is happening. Is it any wonder that as well as failing to tackle the problems in the public sector in delivering an improved health, education and transport service to the citizenry, the employee-employer relationships in the public sector are at a low ebb with an ill-managed and demoralised workforce? All this is taking place at a time when there is more money to improve and manage public sector service delivery than ever before. This is a total failure of Government at a time of unprecedented wealth.</P>
    <P>Partnership in the public sector is the direct responsibility and under the direct control of Government in that it is in effect two of the traditional three partners &ndash; the public sector's manager and the Government. If partnership in the <Col N="665" /> public sector is breaking down, as evidenced by the motion, the Government is doubly responsible. Nurses want sufficient facilities to offer a decent health service. Teachers want sufficient resources and rewards to attract young graduates into the profession of shaping future generations' minds. Bus and train drivers have seen their companies under-resourced for years and part of the transport sector's under-resourcing has also been to starve it of salaries sufficient to attract and retain high quality managers.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that Civil Service clerical grades have been appallingly paid for years. Partnership as a notion cannot replace a living and attractive wage for low paid clerical staff. Various groups of public sector workers cannot be simply dismissed as failing to be partners and causing the underlying reasons for future inflation. There is one common factor in all these partnership-relationship failures, which is the way their employer manages these relationships. The Government is the employer, the manager and the partner all rolled into one.</P>
    <P>The 250,000 workers in the public sector deserve better. The Government must take responsibility for these failures of management and stresses in partnership and act to bring about change. It has failed to tap in to the expertise of the teachers, health service workers and to deal with the challenges of our time effectively. This is a serious governmental and political failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate we have had to put this motion down due to the amount of industrial unrest in the public sector. We have to be honest about this. A number of Government speakers spoke about how the economy is growing at unprecedented levels but they refuse to take into consideration the difficulties we are experiencing in the public sector. My colleagues listed the industrial disputes and those continue in Aer Lingus, the ASTI, the health service and the CIE group. Many other sectors are suggesting they will take industrial action also.</P>
      <P>When I was elected in 1987 we had major difficulties creating jobs. For every ten jobs created 7.8 were in the public or Civil Service. Thankfully we have moved away from that to a situation where for every ten jobs created now only 3.9 are in the public sector. That shows the private sector has increased its provision of jobs enormously. For our economic growth to succeed it was essential that the private sector became involved in job creation.</P>
      <P>Speakers have said that social partnership has played a fundamental role in the good relationship between the social partners and Government and that is correct. However, social partnership is now crumbling because of frustration in the public sector. I do not know if it is necessary for a country our size to employ the numbers we do in the public sector and in the Civil Service. We seem to have a clatter of different organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the free market and in privatising as many semi-State bodies as possible. We have <Col N="666" /> not benefited much from our experience with Eircom. Many individuals who worked hard for Eircom for many years took redundancy payments and now find it almost impossible to find work. Workers in companies like Aer Lingus and CIE fear privatisation as they think it will endanger their careers and that they will not have an opportunity to find other jobs. The train strike in the west last Thursday meant that no trains were running. Last year's train strike, which lasted ten weeks, meant that a lot of business in tourism and other sectors was lost.</P>
    <P>I am bothered by the Government's attitude to industrial relations disputes in the public sector as the Minister for Public Enterprise has abdicated her responsibility. Deputies have been elected as custodians of a number of semi-State companies. The Minister must take responsibility for difficulties in this area rather than setting up a plethora of different organisations and then saying it is no longer her responsibility. She cannot simply shake her shoulders and abdicate responsibility and neither should any of us as elected public representatives as we are all responsible. There is a lot of disquiet within the public sector as workers feel the Government does not care and does not have proposals to deal with problems.</P>
    <P>We must look at a form of social partnership other than that which we have had in recent years, successful as it has been. Public sector workers are voting with their feet by taking industrial action. More strikes have been threatened in the last 12 months than in the previous 20 years, which presents the Government with a huge problem and it cannot afford to just stand by. If there are strikes in Aer Lingus or CIE, there is mayhem throughout the country and if it happens in the provision of health or educational services, problems follow in other sectors.</P>
    <P>As well as coming up with new ideas regarding partnership, I ask the Government to bring a stop to the abdication of responsibility by Ministers. Regardless of who is in Government, responsibility has to be taken when these problems arise. If somebody is honoured by being appointed to a ministerial position, he should not be afraid to take decisions central to the running of the public service if they are relevant to his jurisdiction. Before I conclude, I would like to deal with another issue.</P>

      <P>I do not know where to start as one does not know whether to feel happy or sorry <Col N="667" /> for the Government in its present crisis. At a time when we should be relaxing at the peak of our strength and endeavours and ready to reap rewards, what have we got? The Government has indulged in a little fantasy over the years, although I am not sure if they lean towards Ali Baba or Don Quixote. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, could hallucinate further before the night is out.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, one would have been able to catch a taxi, get on a train, enter Dublin Airport, fly on an Aer Lingus aeroplane, send one's children to school and enjoy all the things to which one had become accustomed without encountering strikes or impediments. There were good industrial relations here five years ago, but there have been changes since then. At a time of unprecedented funds available to the Government, it set out to delude the public and itself. It tried to create a feel good factor which would encourage people to live in a more expensive house and thereby feel much better. As a result, houses have become a luxury. Five years ago, one would have expected to be able to buy a house at a reasonable price but that is no longer a realistic aspiration.</P>
      <P>The culmination of these negatives is that those in the public sector are fed up and have had enough. They can no longer tolerate the pretence as they have paid the price. Eircom investors were carried along by a feel good factor, made to believe that they would make millions of pounds and that everyone would be a millionaire. They felt they had to invest in Eircom shares, which I admit was a good project other than the fact that it was overpriced. Having collected billions of pounds, the Government walked away with its hands clean, leaving the management of Eircom and investors to solve the problems left behind.</P>
      <P>In all of this, very little was said about the consumer or about those who depend on the delivery of service. To whom do they go with their problems? If they usually use trains, they now have to walk, take a bus or stay at home. There are unlimited funds at the Government's disposal. This needs to be emphasised. However, if this happened at a time of deprivation, we would understand and would not mind as much. Nobody can afford to buy a house anymore unless they take out a massive mortgage. As a result, people have to seek higher wages, which means they contribute further to inflation and increases in house prices and all other services. It is strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last couple of hours I have heard Government Members speak of saving the country from destruction in 1987. I apologise to the Chair for raising this matter and I assure him that these remarks are not personal. Fianna Fáil claims to have saved the country from annihilation but forgets to mention that it set the country up for its greatest fall. It took the people of this country almost 20 years to pay for Fianna Fáil's lunatic policies of 1977, such as free car tax. People were led to believe they could live for free <Col N="668" /> forever more, but they were led astray. When this Government came to power four years ago, it set about leading the people astray again, 20 years after it had first done so.</P>
    <P>Those who wonder why we have poor industrial relations should meet those who provide services or who work in the areas that have been mentioned by Members tonight and ask them about their disposable income. Ask those who have sons or daughters in their twenties who are thinking of buying a house what the chances are of their children being able to purchase at a reasonable price. Ask house buyers if they expect to continue to be able to live on their current salary given the rate of house price increases.</P>
    <P>What has happened during the last four years is nothing short of a disgrace. This motion calls on the Government to wake up as it has been snoozing for the last four years and has been led astray by self-delusion. The time for inaction has passed and it is time for the Government to join the real world by recognising that people are waiting for something to be done. I refer not only to those who have gone on strike but to the entire electorate, which is waiting to have its say on this Government. I hope people are more benign in their treatment of the Government in the forthcoming election than the Government has been in its treatment of those who are the subject of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to a question posed by a Deputy when I came into the House is that any increases in pay resulting from benchmarking will also be applied to the relevant pensions.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets out the fundamental economic and social policy framework for this country until 2003. It forms a basis for our fiscal and budgetary strategies and provides the frame of reference for pay developments. As was acknowledged in this House last evening, it contains a number of innovative measures which are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to stability in industrial relations, development of the public service and reform of the process of pay determination.</P>
      <P>A major innovation is the provision for the establishment of the benchmarking body which, it was acknowledged, will undertake a comprehensive comparison of pay and jobs across the public service with pay and jobs across the private sector. In providing for this process, Government and the social partners are moving away from the old system of cross-sectoral relativities and catch up claims. It will ensure that pay rates in the public service are comparable with those in the private sector. It has the capacity to address many of the concerns of the unions and employers, including the issues of recruitment, retention and reward in the public service. The benchmarking body is absolutely independent and will make its recommendations on the basis of its research and analysis. It will not be influenced by any other body, employer or trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further innovation in the promotion of stab<Col N="669" /> ility is the establishment of the National Implementation Body, representing Government, IBEC/CIF and ICTU, to ensure delivery of the industrial peace provisions of the PPF. While responsibility for the resolution of disputes continues to rest primarily with the parties concerned and with the pre-existing industrial relations machinery of the State, this body has already assisted in the resolution of disputes, for example, in the construction industry, Aer Lingus and Iarnród Éireann. It demonstrates the real and continuing commitment of Government and the main employer and trade union organisations to industrial peace and stabililty.</P>
    <P>The partnership process, contrary to some suggestions last evening, has not reached its sell by date. On the contrary, it is a valuable process, with features unique to Ireland, which has allowed us to agree key economic and social imperatives and to set about achieving them. An essential feature underlying the durability of our model of partnership is the flexibility and adaptability built into it. Pressures and problems arise but the partnership system has shown itself to be resilient in its ability to cope with such difficulties. It is a dynamic model which can continue to facilitate and underpin continued economic growth, the sharing of benefits throughout our society and the strategic development of our public service.</P>
    <P>Social partnership can only continue to deliver those benefits if the national agreements are maintained. This requires realistic and responsible attitudes from all elements of society &ndash; the social partners and Government.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that currently no days are being lost through strike actions on pay claims over and above the terms of the PPF. There is effective provision in the National Implementation Body and the well established industrial relations machinery of the State for the conduct of industrial relations and the resolution of disputes in accordance with the terms of the PPF. The work of the benchmarking body is in full swing and its report, due by 30 June 2001, will provide for fair rates of pay comparable with those in the private sector. It is worth emphasising there is an enormous commitment on behalf of the Government to ensure we retain the quality of people who are spread throughout the public service and who serve us well. There is an obvious recognition it would not be correct to have a growing imbalance between pay rates in the private sector and public sector. It is also worth acknowledging that people who work in the public sector have a great loyalty to service to the country and to the State and have served many Governments faithfully.</P>

      <P>Last Friday in Geesala in County Mayo a presentation was made by three Ministers on the task force employment report for north Mayo. Each Minister repeated in turn the mantra of the Celtic tiger, unprecedented growth, low inflation, unprecedented opportunities and this continued for an hour. A housewife from north Mayo, a former employee of the Warner plant in Belmullet, addressed the three Ministers. She said it is all very fine for the Ministers to come down here or be driven down here, but when she looks out her kitchen window tomorrow morning, she will see the same lack of opportunity, the same no hope and the same no change as she saw last year and the year before. She said she was listening to this rubbish from them every day, every week and she was sick of it. She asked them where was their mission statement translated into opportunities for her home, family, people and area. The answer is there is no hope and no change for those people.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question I recently tabled, the Tánaiste spoke of Ireland's competitiveness. She said we are losing our competitive edge in a big way, and not just through economic costs. A financial controller of a major pharmaceutical company approached me recently and told me the company has a subsidiary in China, that the Chinese made two and a half million units of the product this year and its subsidiary had the same quality control, the same product contained in the same bottle with the same label, but employees there work for $1 per hour as against employees of the subsidiary here who work for $18 per hour. How long can that last? The product manufactured here has been damaged in transit on more than one occasion &ndash; for which the Minister of State shares part responsibility &ndash; by virtue of the very poor road structure leading out of the west. What did the National Roads Authority say when we raised such matters with it? It told us that road will be done in 2019. What age will the Minister of State be then? </P>

      <P>What Ministry will he hold? Will he be writing his memoirs? Will he have written about the proceedings at Cabinet meetings? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's reply to Question No. 94 on 3 April is more Civil Service, departmental, ministerial-backed waffle. It refers to the quality of our physical infrastructure, the costs facing business, <Col N="671" /> the services needed by business, the regulatory environment and the effectiveness of public administration. We live will beyond the Shannon, in many ways, in what is prehistoric Ireland, given the comparative features of what is happening elsewhere. We are told by the Government that there are unprecedented opportunities and that this is a golden age.</P>
    <P>The same Minister replied to me the other day and said there are 78,000 job vacancies here which accounts for 6% of the workforce. Why are those jobs not being filled? Where is the training that will help that woman from north Mayo and her family to get a job and have hope and opportunities? When our people living in Boston, London or wherever answer the call from Erin's Government to come home to Ireland, they are then told they cannot build a house on their land because of a particular snail or a particular type of grass blowing in the Atlantic breeze that must be protected for foreign and international visitors to look at and say &ldquo;isn't this a wonderful place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a parallel situation beyond the benchmarking process. The Minister for Education and Science has usurped the benchmarking board by saying that teachers will get at least 10% extra from the benchmarking process. If there was not a common pay strategy and relationship between the three teacher unions, would the ASTI be able to pursue a legitimate pay claim outside the forum of the PPF or are they being forced by Government to comply with a strategy they voted against? Is it that there is a common pay structure that they will get whatever comes out of the benchmarking process and they could not lose in that sense? If another union of major import decides to make its case outside the benchmarking process, what procedure will be followed? Is this legitimate in modern Ireland or are we all to have nice cosy social consensus?</P>
    <P>The single intent of the Government, which is a political intent, is to do whatever they must do to answer whatever questions they must answer but to be back in Government after the people have exercised their franchise and to hell with equality for rural Ireland and places which are not close to Dublin.</P>

      <P>I warn the Minister of State, <Col N="672" /> Deputy Cullen, that the Government is drifting like a ship without a rudder, that it is living in cloud cuckoo land. Is the Minister of State aware of the escalating industrial unrest which has set in at Aer Lingus, among the secondary teachers, at CIE, at ESB, among nurses and junior hospital doctors, among farmers and shopkeepers, in the hotel industry, in the tourism industry, in the fishing industry and in several other industries? All are waiting for leadership from a Government which has sadly lacked it, not giving any commitment to boost the natural resources of Ireland. Our only natural industries are fishing, farming and tourism. What is the Government doing to maintain stability in those great industries? The Celtic tiger economy is losing its bite. In fact, the print of its paws is indiscernible in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Country roads are disintegrating at such a rate that soon they will not be there at all for the want of finance to maintain them. Is the Minister of State aware that Cork County Council is operating in an area one-eighth the size of the country and yet it got £6,000 less per kilometre than much smaller county council areas received for this year? Is that justice? The Government sadly lacks it as far as Cork is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to have lost its vision when it comes to looking after the people of that part of the country. We have had no railway system for the past 57 years. South west Cork is bigger than many counties yet we have been sadly and sorely neglected. We do not have an airport, a rail service or one mile of national primary roads. Where have the fruits of the Celtic tiger economy gone?</P>
      <P>The Central Bank bulletin for spring 2001 forecasts a slowing of output growth to about 7%, mainly reflecting a smaller contribution to growth from net exports. The honeymoon period of the Celtic tiger economy seems to be disappearing rapidly. Fate seemed be very kind to Fianna Fáil and the Government. They took over in 1997 when the tide was turning in their favour. The old saying states that a rising tide floats all crafts, but alas this Government's craft of State seems to have sprung a leak. The signs are evident that the buoyancy of the Celtic tiger economy is rapidly disappearing. Unrest has appeared in all sectors of the community and we now face a dismal tourist season. What aid will the Government give to the small hoteliers who have lost thousands of bookings because of circumstances outside their control, and to the small publicans and the small shopkeepers who are saddled with high rates which are escalating throughout the country? Will the Government give them any remission? Will it take into consideration the serious situation in rural Ireland today? We all cannot live in Dublin, Galway, Cork city, Waterford or Limerick. Rural Ireland is fast disappearing and the Government does not seem to be that concerned with its disappearance. It seems to be consigning it as a wildlife park for wealthy European and international tourists in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members from all parties who contributed to this debate. I thank the Labour Party for its support and Deputy Jim Higgins for his introductory remarks yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>More than anything else, the fact that there has been no response from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the fact that there is no Minister for labour is indicative of the present state of affairs in industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The lack of engagement on the part of the Government was encapsulated neatly last week by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, throwing her hands in the air and stating that there was nothing she could do to prevent a national rail strike. Her actions confirmed that the Government remains immobile and detached on the vital matter of industrial relations. Industrial disputes in Aer Lingus and Iarnród Éireann have seriously questioned the existence in the State of rail and air transport services in which people can have any real confidence.</P>
      <P>Recently there have been a succession of disputes in air transport, with baggage handlers, caterers, pilots, ground staff and cabin crew all seeking better pay and improved conditions. Last week's rail dispute, still not settled, could yet result in a summer of rail transport chaos similar to what we experienced last year. The damage which will result to business, enterprise, commerce and tourism will be enormous and a prolonged rail strike would cost the economy millions of pounds. Equally important is the damage that would be inflicted as the image of Ireland abroad as a place in which to invest or engage in business would be severely tarnished. As the sole shareholder, the Minister needs to show a measure of leadership. While both management and trades unions have particular responsibilities, the Minister must act positively and decisively and be on hand to facilitate and encourage.</P>
      <P>In an era of industrial unrest, leadership is required more so than in times of peace. When the icebergs appear the ship needs a steady hand and a clear thinking captain capable and willing to engage in positive action and to be on hand to inspire confidence. What we are experiencing now from Government is a hands-off approach from people who convey a distinct impression of not wishing to know.</P>
      <P>There is a clear duty on the part of Government, employers and trades unions to commit themselves towards reaching agreement on appropriate codes of practice within the partnership model to ensure the maintenance of essential services at all times. The maintenance of essential services is vital to avoid chaos throughout the economy and huge loss and damage to business, enterprise and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> While new pay guidelines are needed to sustain the current social partnership model there is a corresponding duty on all concerned to promote industrial peace and harmony and an advanced code of practice on dispute procedures is vital for the maintenance of good order throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>Much of our current difficulty surrounds the manner in which the fruits of the Celtic tiger economy are distributed throughout society. In this regard particular notice must be given to inflation and its consequences.</P>
    <P>Inflation figures for last month indicate that we are on course for an annual average of about 5%, which is well ahead of Government predictions and expectations. The Government can no longer blame the price of oil, the weak euro and international factors as rising food and drink prices, along with the transport, telephone and child care costs and medical fees, have all contributed to an inflation increase for the third month in a row. Food inflation is now 7.7%, the highest for 16 years. This must be particularly worrying and urgent action is required on this particular issue about which we have very little in recent times.</P>
    <P>Inflation figures are adding further to new wage rounds which will threaten our competitiveness and thereby stifle economic growth. This growth is already forecast to be down on last year and it appears that the economy is slowing to about half the pace of this time last year. Inflation, along with the slow down in the US economy and job losses in the high-tech industry here, will result in a reduction of confidence and a cycle of bad news which may well damage consumer confidence even further. The Government appears to have no concrete plan of action. There are no proposals on the table that we know of to deal with this issue. Nothing we heard last night from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, could do anything to inspire confidence regarding the current difficulties and, as I said, we have not heard from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, whose area of responsibility seems to be directly in the area of enterprise and industrial relations. There is no sign of the Ministers of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Tom Kitt and Treacy or of the invisible Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. The majority of Cabinet members have been in office for far too long and they lack focus. They give the impression of being tired and disinterested. They should actively consider vacating their positions due to an inability on their part to deal with the matters in any co-ordinated and pro-active fashion. I urge the House to support the motion this evening.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 February 1995 two young people died in a canoeing accident at Dunmore East. Subsequently, not long ago, a similar accident occurred at Dunany, County Louth. Since then it has been acknowledged by all parties in the House that legislation to govern safety standards in activity centres is needed. Michael Davies, the father of one of the young boys who died in the tragedy at Dunmore East, has been to the forefront of the campaign to progress this issue as the Minister rightly pointed out.</P>
      <P>In March 1999 the House debated a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Finucane. entitled the Adventure Centres (Young Persons' Water Safety) Bill, it was approved by all Members, although it was accepted that broader legislation, that dealt with issues beyond water safety, needed to be put on the Statute Book. Deputy Finucane deserves to be congratulated on his initiative in March 1999 and the manner in which this House handled that debate was a credit to all involved.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, established an interdepartmental working group to consider the regulation of adventure centres. This group reported in June 1999 and advised that legislation, along the lines of that which has been introduced to the House today, was necessary.</P>
      <P>Following a consultative process with the various interests in the adventure centre industry the Department moved forward with drafting the Bill. The Labour Party welcomes the broad thrust of the Bill and will support it on Second Stage. While this Bill is comprehensive, on Committee Stage the Labour Party will bring forward amendments to strengthen parts of it. Safety and high standards must be at the forefront of the minds of people who operate adventure centres and, while the track record of Irish adventure centres is very good by international standards, it is important to have a regulatory authority that can establish and monitor standards across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 includes the 13 categories identified in the Bill as &ldquo;adventure activities&rdquo;. More than half of these activities are water-based sports such as surfing, scuba diving and dinghy sailing. There is one water-based activity which I know has given rise to concern among many coastal communities which is not included in this list and I urge the Minister to include it. I am referring to the increasingly popular use of jet-skis, small <Col N="678" /> motorised craft that are used close to the shore. In the wrong hands, and without proper supervision, these machines are a danger both to the user and to other people in the vicinity of the beaches.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources will have received representations on the use of these craft from many Members of the House and from members of the general public. This activity should be included in the list of adventure activities and subject to the regulation and supervision provided for in this Bill. It is an issue to which I am sure we will return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate the reason certain activities were omitted. For example, mountain biking is not included in the list. While nobody would contend that the popular &ldquo;rent-a-bike&rdquo; operators are engaged in adventure activities, there is a growing interest in people cycling off-road, often on mountain tracks. Without the necessary equipment and training this can prove a dangerous pursuit and there may be a case to include this activity in Section 8. The representative bodies have pointed out that rafting is not included either and I am sure that we will return to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The later sections deal with the establishment of the adventure activities standards authority. I welcome the definition of the functions of the authority in section 14. This section states that the function of the authority will be to &ldquo;promote, encourage, foster, facilitate and regulate the safe operation of adventure activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From this wording it is clear the main aim of the body will be to work in partnership with this growing sector of our tourism industry to promote the highest standards. It is the right way to proceed and I believe the vast majority of adventure centre operators will work positively with the new authority.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy for a county, part of which has been hit hardest by the recent foot and mouth disease crisis, I am only too aware of the support and assistance the tourism industry needs to recover from this body blow. State agencies, including the new authority, which will be established under this Bill, must work in partnership with the industry to recover the ground that has been lost.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there is not a reference in the Bill to cross Border co-operation with similar authorities in Northern Ireland; although the Minister referred briefly to that in his speech. Tourism was one of the areas identified for cross Border co-operation between the Stormont executive and our Government. However, it appears to me that this aspect has not been developed in the Bill. It would be eminently sensible for adventure centre operators on the island as a whole to operate to common standards. I hope the Minister will have talks with his colleague, Deputy McDaid, to ensure that, after the passage of this Bill, the Northern Assembly Minister, Sir Reg Empey, is fully briefed on devel<Col N="679" /> opments in this jurisdiction so that they can be co-ordinated in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 27 refers to the production of an annual report, which the Minister will lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I urge him to forward a copy of this report to the Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation for consideration. As we increase the number of statutory bodies, it is important that their annual reports are debated and scrutinised within the committee system. It is good for accountability and democracy and assists Committees in understanding the developments in specific areas as new bodies embark on their work.</P>
    <P>Part III refers to the regulation of operators. Section 33 outlines the regulations on compiling, and maintaining the register. Section 33 (5) refers to making the register &ldquo;available for inspection by members of the public at reasonable times during normal working hours&rdquo;. Does this preclude or allow the publication of the register on a website, where it could be accessed by the public at any time and with the greatest of ease?</P>
    <P>I again welcome the introduction of this Bill. I know a large number of Members have an interest in seeing legislation to regulate this area. Through the debate here this evening and the previous debate in March 1999, we have explored many of the issues surrounding this legislation and I look forward to the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of how and why organisations will go on the register and co-ordinating activity concerning that register will be very important. Like much other legislation in the marine area I have to ask the Minister how he proposes to police the terms of this Bill. Where will the manpower come from? He mentioned a figure of £300,000 but this will not go far in supervising this on a national basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I recognise the commitment of the Minister and Deputy Finucane's involvement in activating the interest in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Throughout the debate, Members on all sides have recognised its importance. It has been drawn up following recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on a review of the safety regulations of adventure activity centres. The consultation and most importantly interdepartmental co-operation and planning will ensure the Bill's effectiveness in implementation.</P>
      <P>It serves the needs of providers by giving them a framework for co-operation and protects citizens who embark on the named adventure activities covered in the Bill. It also protects a broad range of people, who will come under various provisions of the Bill and this will be welcomed by representatives of those interests. It embraces the many needs and interests of these named activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister establish a rescue service consultative forum whereby the new authority can learn from the vast experience of the rescue ser<Col N="680" /> vices? Before I came into this House, I worked as an air traffic controller and was quite aware of the importance of the search and rescue services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the clarity of this Bill which encompasses the interests and needs of so many. The initial list of adventure activities is quite comprehensive and the Bill clearly demands a mature regard for the safety of practitioners of these activities.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days I have heard people ask whether the penalties are a sufficient deterrent. For the safety authority to be effective it must have teeth through having available to it, where necessary, draconian powers of seizure and closure. We must keep to the forefront the fact that people's lives as opposed to operators' livelihoods are at stake. Fines do not deter unscrupulous operators. Often their attitude is based on the court case being weeks or months in the future and they think they might as well squeeze as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting public while they can.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given inspectors considerable powers of inspection, including search warrants, rights of entry and inspection. These should be backed up with readily available sanctions, including naming and shaming, seizure and even closure. If adequate safety standards are to be maintained, we must ensure rogue operators do not feel it is worth their while to flout the laws. While the authority will no doubt in time introduce certification procedures, there should be provision in the legislation ensuring operators must display prominently at all times the relevant safety and operating certificates. A blue flag type system should also be developed so members of the public can clearly see what safety procedures are required to be in operation. If they can see that an operator is not maintaining adequate standards they are in a position not to use their facilities. Ultimately, people must take responsibility for their own safety, irrespective of legislation, and they should be assisted in every way through guides, notices and other materials.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about being a killjoy but about ensuring people can enjoy adventure sporting activities in comfort and in the knowledge that those who sell or hire the activity or equipment are complying with the best practice and safety standards laid down by the State regulator.</P>
    <P>Tragically, too many lives have been lost because even minimum safety requirements were not met or were not known of in some cases. A few years ago young lives were lost off the Wexford coast because lifejackets did not have reflective strips. These simple stickers could have enabled the rescue services who were quickly on the scene to identify the canoeists quickly in the dark waters. Such a simple low cost measure could have made a difference. There are too many other examples of simple precautions not being taken with disastrous and tragic consequences.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Bill as a member of the <Col N="681" /> Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Often regulations are seen as getting in the way of the operation of a business, with regulators often being seen as killjoys. Regulations do not stop people doing the things they want to, but can slow people down and help to take away the danger. Regulations exist to ensure people's safety and not to act as an impediment to the enjoyment of their chosen activity. The Minister and every Deputy wants the spirit of adventure which those who participate in adventure sports to continue. It is to the legislators that the parents and families of those who lost their lives turn when tragedy strikes. Relatives of the bereaved seeking answers for their loved ones' deaths are too often appalled by the laxity of current regulations, and the Bill is primarily focused on addressing this issue. It demands investigation of incidents, tragic or potentially so, and calls people to account, one of its most important features. It demands that those who set out to participate in sports know exactly what they are doing.</P>
    <P>If we can establish a reputation for operating to the highest international standards we will become an attractive option for participation in these activities for our own citizens as well as for overseas visitors. Operating within clearly defined safety standards enhances our reputation both at home and abroad. Ultimately people involved in delivering services in the area will find their livelihoods enhanced and participation more rewarding. We have unrivalled natural resources for such adventure activities, from Atlantic waves to the rolling hills of the Slieve Blooms. The authority proposed in the Bill will further enhance the reputation of this country as a holiday destination for great safe fun amid beautiful surroundings. The Bill is about ensuring people have fun in a safe and secure environment.</P>
    <P>Responsible members of the industry will respond well to the authority and will seek to make it an effective regulator. They will see the advantages of having an effective standards authority which will enhance the image of their activities both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister to increase the sanctions available to the authority to ensure irresponsible operators do not go about their business unhindered and unimpeded. People's lives are at stake and no measure is too draconian in tackling rogue traders. They will not shirk when it comes to dodging their responsibilities, and the authority must have the power to ensure they will face the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>The authority must be adequately staffed to ensure its main work is preventative. There are important provisions in the Bill which give the authority powers to investigate accidents and bring prosecutions where necessary. The old cliché that prevention is better than cure must be a core value of the new authority. Many of the activities of the authority will be seasonal which will put a further drain on staffing resources. In this regard the Internet, telephone and television cannot replace the work of the inspectorate. <Col N="682" /> There is no substitute for an inspector's visit on site, expertly observing, checking and challenging. On-site visits can be of great assistance to the operators who wish to improve their service.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill to allow experts and others to be engaged when required. This will ensure that an organisation which is small in terms of human resources can reach a long way in an effective manner. The focus of the authority must be accident prevention and the improvement of safety standards. While accident investigation is necessary and can be a useful learning process, we must try to ensure we learn from past mistakes.</P>
    <P>I agree with the broad representation allowed for on the authority and I ask the Minister to consider allowing representation from the rescue services who sadly see the tragic results of poor safety standards. Their experience and advice could be invaluable. If things go wrong, it is their lives that are put at risk. The forum would give them a say in accident prevention. Full representation from all the relevant rescue services would make the authority unwieldy. A rescue services consultative forum should be established whereby the authority could learn from the services, including air rescue, fire, ambulance, marine and coastal rescue, Civil Defence, mountain rescue, cave rescue and RNLI to name but a few who have been at the front line of tragedy for many years. There is a wealth of experience available to the authority which has a huge task ahead of it. The forum could work as a valuable sounding board. The rescue services have a vested interest in the success of the authority and could provide it with a huge database of practical knowledge. Even at this stage I ask the Minister to consider putting such a forum on a statutory footing. There is too much to be learned from the rescue services to leave it to chance, and seeking their views must be a continuous process. The safety of all those who take to the sea, air, mountains, lakes or caves is at stake and we must learn from past mistakes.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Bill which allows for the establishment and funding of the adventure activities standards authority. It has huge implications for the safety of all those who participate in adventure sports and will, I hope, ensure those participants live long, happy and adventure filled lives. I commend the Minister, Deputy Fahey, for bringing to the House this long overdue Bill which will have unforeseen benefits for thousands of adventurous people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I am pleased we are at last discussing it on Second Stage because I thought it would not be discussed before the next election. However, I am pleased we have advanced to this stage. I am particularly pleased because it is not often a Member of the Opposition gets an opportunity to introduce a Private Members' Bill, which I did when I introduced the Bill in March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his officials were correct <Col N="683" /> because it was restricted exclusively at the time to water-based activity centres. I recognised that this was a start but it could be broadened out afterwards. I accepted the arguments put forward by the Minister and his officials that, based on the Bill I presented, they would broaden it further and carry out a lot of research to ensure the legislation would encompass all adventure centres, whether inland or along the coastline. I welcomed the commitment given by the Minister to establish an interdepartmental working group to carry out research into the whole safety aspect of adventure centres. Obviously they had the benefit of being able to research what happened in the UK and took trips to both Scotland and England in this regard. That was important because we did not vote on the Bill at the time. I was very impressed with all the tributes paid to me at the time in moving forward the legislation.</P>
    <P>I was motivated to introduce the legislation as a result of a series of meetings with Michael Davies who has been referred to on many occasions. The Minister also referred to Mr. Davies from Waterford. From the first time I met him, I was very impressed by his commitment and desire for legislation to underpin these activity centres. This man tragically lost his son, Ros, and another young man, as a result of what happened in Dunmore East which proved to me that there was a deficiency in the operation of adventure centres.</P>
    <P>The Bord Fáilte marketing brochures describe Ireland as a holiday destination and encourage people to avail of adventure centres. It also states in its literature that it is up to individuals to take out appropriate insurance. I do not think this is right because in many cases people as young as six use these adventure centres. Parents who send young people to adventure centres deserve to know whether legislation underpins the performance and activities of these centres. The legislation will help in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Association for Adventure Sports, AFAS, for the standards it sets down for the different adventure centres. It set down these standards and regulations on a shoestring budget but there was no compulsion on people to comply with the regulations. Not only were adventure centres operating under VEC control, but some commercial centres took guidance from AFAS and others operated on their own. I do not think people who use adventure centres would be aware of the difference or discriminate accordingly. There was always a degree of comfort in relation to centres which operated under the vocational education committees because they came under the Department of Education and Science and, God forbid, if anything happened, one would probably feel there were controls in place and one would be covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>The legislation will broaden and enhance considerably the whole area of adventure centres. When the legislation is in place I would encourage the promotion of these centres in tourism <Col N="684" /> brochures in order to encourage people to use more of these facilities. We are very fortunate to have 2,000 miles of coastline, including many wonderful locations, unused inlets and attractions for foreign visitors, marvellous lakes and so on and no crowding as such. We have a great country and that is why these adventure centres will be improved under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to commercial ventures where vocational education committees are involved, there are inherent advantages in their education centres. While we must recognise that commercial ventures operate in the world of reality, the legislation will require them to adhere to certain standards. I am concerned about section 20 in relation to the imposition of various charges, which is different to those operating under the Health and Safety Authority. I would like that aspect to be considered further. Perhaps there could be other minor modifications on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The legislation covers a wide diversity of activities on which I do not intend to elaborate. There have been representations in regard to raft building and gorge walking. Another aspect which should be considered is field studies. This activity was mentioned on television yesterday where young people were allowed to take part in the activity as a result of a partial easing of the foot and mouth restrictions in England. These young people heard a person who had fallen down an old mine shaft shouting and saved his life. I would like to see that activity included in the legislation because it is carried on in leisure centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about different aspects and I mentioned earlier the interdepartmental working group. I had a number of earlier consultations with Michael Guilfoyle on the issue and I wish to compliment him on the work he has put into it. As a result we now have very good legislation which will be accepted by those involved in adventure centres and in these activities. I wish the legislation well. It has vindicated the approaches to me by Mr. Davies which helped me to introduce my Bill and get the legislation moving. We needed to be galvanised into taking action in this area. I am pleased this has happened and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to other provisions which are not in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this aspect because other legislation may have impacted on it. Jet skiing was referred to earlier and if we get a fine, blissful summer we will all become conscious of this activity around our coastline. Many young people with high levels of testosterone and a macho touch will be using these jet skis which I would classify as aquatic motorbikes. They will cause a lot of fear and trepidation among people living and visiting these areas along the coastline. I understand that controls were supposed to be introduced but this was to be by way of self-regulation by local authorities. I do not know how far this has advanced. The recent introduction of lifejackets was <Col N="685" /> extremely important. Tragedies have taken place in the past due to the absence of lifejackets.</P>
    <P>The sad loss of four Air Corps personnel on the coast of Waterford occurred after they had responded to an emergency call-out, where people were using a vessel which did not have life rafts, which should be standard equipment for anybody going out to sea but are often neglected. This should be covered by compulsory legislation, as also should be the case with regard to flares. Power boats can be highly dangerous, particularly going from inshore out to more choppy waters, and fatalities have also occurred in that context.</P>
    <P>This Bill will help people to focus more on safety issues which they may have previously tended to ignore and I therefore welcome it. Having inquired about it on numerous occasions on the Order of Business and in questions to the Taoiseach, I was disappointed that it had not been introduced earlier, though I accept that much work was required on it. I hope that Second Stage will proceed swiftly and Committee Stage should not take very long. The legislation should be in operation this summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill for the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority, which many people would say is overdue. I commend the Department personnel, the working group who did an excellent job, and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for the effort which has been made to have a very comprehensive list. While many of the activities to be regulated are within the Minister's remit, quite a few activities are not.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of the authority, there will be a mandatory registration procedure and mandatory codes for specified activities. Many people will be surprised to learn that this was not already the case, as there is a high level of risk attached to some of the activities concerned. The authority will, of course, be charged with implementing the regulatory scheme and with the important function of inspecting the various operators. In the event that an operation does not meet the standards, the authority will have the power to shut it down. That may well be the most important feature of the entire Bill.</P>
      <P>There is provision for the authority to make recommendations to the Minister for regulations which may be introduced by him. I particularly welcome the provision for additional activities to be added on. Indeed, some of the activities are relatively new to me. The move towards adventure sports is welcome for many reasons. This Bill goes considerably further than the UK model, which I believe is a 1995 Act dealing only with water sports. This Bill is all the better and more efficacious for having taken on a much wider remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group undertook extensive consultations with the adventure sports sector and I understand that it got excellent co-operation from both the public and private centres involved. Although there was an existing code for <Col N="686" /> voluntary inspection, I was surprised to note from the report of the interdepartmental group that so many operators were outside of that voluntary code. The Association for Adventure Activities and the Irish Sailing Association had done great work in setting up codes of practice as, in a sense, forerunners to the provisions of this Bill. However, it is much better to have a mandatory system. It appears that, heretofore, anyone was entitled to set up a commercial operation, offering training and participation in water sports and other activities, which are inherently quite dangerous if not conducted in accordance with a good code of safety. Apart from the risk to participants and to people in their vicinity, there was also a risk to those who might be called on to assist them in the event of something going wrong, as in the Tramore incident to which Deputy Finucane has referred.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's introductory remarks, he mentioned that the campaign for this legislation goes back to an unfortunate accident some years ago. One of the great benefits which will flow from the Bill is that it will force people to be safety conscious. It will introduce a safety conscious ethos among people operating these activities. In fairness, most of them already come prepared and have the right frame of mind. However, in view of the substantial number of people now involved in these sports, it is essential to have a mandatory code.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the submission from Outdoor Education Ireland, which is the association of public outdoor education centres. One of the activities which they suggest including in section 8 (1) is raft building, of which I had no knowledge until my attention was drawn to it while passing an activity centre in Killaloe recently. The definition of the activity which the association suggested is &ldquo;the construction of a vessel from ropes, spars and buoyancy tanks, for the purpose of supporting crew members above the waterline, which is capable of being manoeuvred along a waterway.&rdquo; Apparently, it is a hugely popular activity with young people attending camps. The association has indicated that virtually everybody attending an adventure camp, either public or private, is likely to be involved in this activity at some stage. Since the participants construct the raft as well as try to sail it, there is considerable opportunity for things to go wrong. I believe the Minister is well disposed towards including it.</P>
    <P>Gorge walking, which I cannot attempt to define, was also mentioned. It could well be an activity which should be included in the definition. The association suggested, in relation to section 20, that no fees or charges should be made on operators, in the way that the Health and Safety Authority operates. I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>A very strong case was made on behalf of the public outdoor education centres that, in the case of the four nominees from adventure activity operators, there should be two each from the <Col N="687" /> public and private centres. They appear to be under the impression that there is an agreement, at least in principle, that one of the public centre representatives should be from the chief executive officers' organisation and one from the Outdoor Education Ireland body. As these are the people with the greatest expertise in running adventure centres, there is a good case for giving them that level of representation.</P>
    <P>They also raise what seems quite a sensible query in relation to the definition of hill walking and orienteering. They suggest that, rather than the 300 metre contour level, remote wilderness areas should be included in the Bill. Their suggested definition is &ldquo;an area five kilometres from the nearest access road, or roadside help being more than one hour away.&rdquo;  That seems to be a sensible suggestion, which I feel sure the Minister will consider.</P>
    <P>They also mention a need for clarification in section 9(1)(f2&gt;c). I suggest that the case is well made that it should read &ldquo;any two or more of the activities in (f2&gt;a) or (f2&gt;b).&rdquo; It is not the intention that someone operating only one such activity should be exempt from registration and compliance with the Act. There are two different sorts of definitions in A and B and that needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of health and physical education we have become more conscious and aware of the need to involve young people. Many of us did not have the opportunity to involve ourselves in any of the activities listed here and provision cannot be made for them in the normal second level education system. The VEC system provided outdoor centres with all these activities and allowed access to second level students and other groups. We have perhaps made the mistake of assuming the activities of these centres are activities for children and teenagers and we tend to exclude ourselves from them. One of the benefits of the enactment of this legislation might be that older people will opt to take part in some of these healthy activities. They give people a new experience and access to a new environment. If people embrace these activities and if they are delivered in a more regulated and organised way they have the potential to impact positively on the health status of our population. That will bring all kinds of benefits such as reducing the need for health care and will make people more conscious of the benefits of such activities.</P>
    <P>A factor that inhibited the development of these centres was the remuneration package available to instructors in the public centres. I suspect the pay of many in the private centres was even worse. The Department of Education and Science, which effectively controls the running of the VEC centres, should address, as a matter of urgency, the pay of instructors in these centres. The people who work in them have an enormous commitment to making the activities safe and enjoyable for the participants. They go to great lengths to encourage people to take an interest <Col N="688" /> subsequently and to take a long-term interest. Nothing destroys the capacity to survive of an individual, or of a service, as quickly as poor pay and conditions. If the kind of pay and conditions which pertained when I was chairman of a VEC some years ago still apply then they need to be addressed urgently. That can only be done in the public centres by the Department of Education and Science. If the public centres addressed it, the private centres would be forced to follow and the whole area of the standards of instructors could be addressed with it. Standards of instruction and safety would be raised generally and that would benefit everybody involved.</P>
    <P>There are two centres operated by the VEC in County Clare, both in the Burren. The original outdoor pursuit centre is now joined with the UCG research centre and they operate in tandem. They provide a wonderful level of service for the people with access to them, not just schools but youth groups and sometimes adult groups. They provide a tremendous resource to people in the county and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Besides the health benefits of such centres there is tremendous potential in the area of tourism. The damage our industry sometimes suffers due to inclement weather conditions would not be a problem in the area of adventure activity. Many people, particularly those involved in water based activities, consider such inclement conditions to be an advantage. If, as a result of this legislation, we raise the standards in the area of adventure sports we will see great benefits in the tourism area. We have a long coastline, a lot of rugged countryside suitable for rock-climbing and many areas with accessible caves that would encourage visitors. We should look on it as a specific area of tourism open for a huge level of development.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, it does not need a large level of capital investment and it has the capacity to enable areas, which in the past did not benefit greatly from tourism, to become beneficiaries. In my county the entire west coast area, and to some extent the Burren in the north, have benefited enormously from tourism and areas such as the Cliffs of Moher and created activities such as those at Bunratty folk park attract huge numbers of visitors. Other areas in east Clare like Mountshannon and Killaloe already have the capacity to enable people to participate in these sports but there is a huge area of the county where activities such as hill-walking and rock-climbing could be developed. These areas have traditionally depended on the limited amount of angling tourism which has not had the benefit of huge growth in recent times.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should refer to other adventure activities not suitable to be covered by this legislation but which need to be examined and if there is existing legislation in this area it needs to be tightened. I refer to funfairs, playgrounds and car racing which take place in semi-controlled conditions. These activities do not involve the participant in any meaningful activity that would carry <Col N="689" /> a health benefit. They can, however, be the occasion of horrendous accidents. The area does not seem to be controlled as it should be. Another fact is that anybody could come along to almost any of our public beaches or waterways and set up a commercial activity such as canoeing, surfing, etc. without reference to any controlling authority or any code of safety. That must be cause for considerable concern and should be the first area addressed by the authority.</P>
    <P>The authority should also address the qualification of those involved in running and directing the centres. Arising from that, there will be a need to provide training centres. We may be pleasantly surprised by the number of people prepared to take the opportunity to work in and operate these centres. The level of care and professionalism they will bring to them will enhance the entire area of activity sports and will lead to more involvement by the people and the natural resources of the countryside will be used in a more pro-active and meaningful way.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for having introduced the Bill and the Department for embracing and including activities which might be sometimes considered outside their remit. I look forward to the establishment of the authority and its operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill. Its purpose is to establish a new legislative regime to promote and enhance the safety of all persons engaged in adventure activities. The Minister stated that its key purpose is the establishment of an independent adventure activity standard authority, and that is important. The need for such an authority was highlighted by Deputy Finucane when he introduced a similar Bill taking in part of this issue in August 1998. When it was before the House, Deputy Woods gave a commitment to establish an independent working group whose report would be followed by legislation. While the Minister said it worked speedily, such work takes time and we were waiting some time on this side of the House. The group was charged with making recommendations to improve the safety of adventure centres. It consulted widely with the main representative bodies in the sector in Ireland and in the UK to ascertain the effectiveness of UK legislation. It is important to learn from others.</P>
      <P>The group submitted its report in June 1999. It found there was a case for reform of statutory regulation. It is important, bearing in mind the dangers to young children, that parents, teachers and all involved ensure that children are as safe as possible and that the regulations are met. We all know of accidents and the Minister referred to some in his speech. They occur too often and this area needs proper regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the adventure activity standard authority will be to promote, facilitate and regulate the safety operations of adventure activities. It will administer schemes and grants. Grants are important to procure or provide educational <Col N="690" /> training and advisory services, or carry out research. The Bill defines all the adventure sports and some are dangerous. Yesterday, there was the case of an Englishman trapped in a cave who was found by accident, illustrating how dangerous these sports can be. Under the Bill, adventure activity operators must register with the authorities. Importantly, there will be inspectors authorised by the authority.</P>
    <P>All this will add to the cost of running these centres. The Minister does not mention a commitment to cover the extra costs. Insurance is already dear and meeting the regulations will add to costs. We must make sure the young who benefited from these places will continue to do so. If costs are increased dramatically, they may lose the chance. People who are healthier than I am will appreciate that the young should be taught and encouraged in these activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the authority will investigate any accident, incident or any other matter related to the general purposes of the activities. Investigation will be solely to establish the cause of accidents and the adequacy of the published codes of practice. If there is an accident, it is important that there will be a proper follow up and measures put in place to ensure a similar accident does not occur.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking tonight is the Tannagh outdoor pursuits centre, at Dardry, near Cootehill on the Cavan-Monaghan border. It has been there for nine years, employing eight people. The chairman of the Tannagh pursuits body, my fellow councillor, Hugh McIlvanney, said that it lives on a wing and a prayer. As Oireachtas Members, we got a briefing from its committee a couple of years ago. It is difficult to accept that a centre so close to the Border, with the EU INTERREG and peace and reconciliation funds, and money available for other projects such as the National Stadium, is not properly funded. Thousands of young people from the area and other counties, like Monaghan and Meath, and north of the Border benefit from this centre. It is in an old building owned by the White Fathers, which was used for many years as a seminary and then as an Army barracks. The White Fathers lease the premises for a small sum to the VEC, a gesture from them towards not just the young of the region but towards peace and reconciliation as groups from all backgrounds meet there, have fun and get involved in activities such as water sports and forest walks. The VEC subsidised the income from the participants. It has the opportunity to acquire six acres of Coillte land if it were not in its interests to buy the Tannagh centre itself.</P>
    <P>The VEC has to buy or lease the centre long-term because Government and other institutions will not give major grants to rented property. We appreciate this. Whenever the VEC sought funding to buy the Coillte land, it was told it could not get money for that. This Coillte land is just across the road from the centre, it is right along the lake, in the middle of the forest and is along a quite a <Col N="691" /> large river. It is has all sorts of potential. It is within a couple of miles of the Cavan border and the town of Cootehill would benefit greatly from it &ndash; a town that needs this sort of structure.</P>
    <P>Under the new regulations being brought forward under the VEC (Amendment) Bill, Cavan and Monaghan vocational education committees could work together on this and make sure it is a major project. It is not sufficient to talk about regulations and so on. In a Border region that has suffered so much over the last 30 odd years and which has the goodwill of the White Fathers and others to provide the facilities at reasonable cost, I urge the Government to make an effort to make sure something is done now. In case the Minister thinks this is the first time this has been raised here, I assure him it is not and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can verify what I am saying. I picked a few letters from the file and I have one here from the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, dated 30 November 1997. In answer to a number of questions I had asked about VEC issues, the query relating to the Tannagh outdoor education centre&mdash;</P>

      <P>That letter said it would be dealt with by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Other letters said it would be dealt with after a major inquiry. That inquiry was presented on 12 January 1999 and the position of Tannagh centre was to be considered in the context of that inquiry. Another letter dated July 1999 said more of the same, more recently, a letter said it was being investigated and the last letter I have dated June 2000 said inquiries were being made into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this Bill is brought in but it will not be very relevant to Cavan-Monaghan if the funds are not made available soon to a major and very important centre such as the Tannagh outdoor pursuits centre. Never before has so much money been available. The youth should be encouraged to get involved in sport and other activities undertaken at this pursuits centre. It would be better than having longer pub hours. We want to make sure young people get every opportunity and encouragement to become involved in this area and to ensure it is properly regulated, which is what this Bill is all about. I hope that as this Bill is going through the House, the Government will look seriously at the points raised about the need for support and genuine commitment to young people. This is not just a <Col N="692" /> request &ndash; I am literally begging the Government at this late stage. There have been so many inquiries and discussions and it is now time for action.</P>

      <P>As the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the enactment of a new legislative regime to promote and enhance the safety of all people who engage in adventure activities in adventure centres, I thoroughly welcome it. I also welcome the establishment of the independent standards authority to regulate the safety of adventure activity centres and providers. This Bill has the potential to benefit most age groups and all class divides. It will allow for the establishment of the authority; the mandatory registration of the centres and providers with the authority for specified activities; for the mandatory codes of safe operating practice for specified adventure activities; for the implementation of the regulatory scheme involving inspection of centres and providers and for adherence to safety codes. It will also give powers to the authority to order cessation of the provision of any, or all, adventure activities in the case of failure to observe safety codes. In that respect, it is embracing, although I will address a couple of points as I go along in relation to what it allows for and what it probably does not allow for.</P>
      <P>It is very sad that this legislation was moved on because of the death of the young people in Dunmore East. Coming from a coastal community that has experienced a number of casualties and fatalities at the hands of the water, I extend my sympathy, even at this late stage, to all the families who have lost members to the sea, either as a result of adventure activities or a commercial endeavour in which they were involved.</P>
      <P>It was important that the Department carry out the review. I am glad to recognise Deputy Finucane's role in this and to see that best practice was sought and looked for not only in the UK but further afield. Listening to some of the more learned contributors this evening, we have surpassed the UK in terms of what is being done in this Bill. The interdepartmental working group, which completed its report in June 1999, found that the safety standards in the sector are generally high and with little risk to the participants from the activities themselves. That is a great testament to the facilities we have around the country.</P>
      <P>As many speakers said, adventure centres are only being to happen. We have a tremendous centre in County Donegal, the Gartan centre, which came from basically nothing to become a centre with a great name and reputation. Those in the VEC at the time who asked that it be bought are very proud. Despite the fact many different Departments fought against them at the time, it was a wise, great and important move. Many politicians know Gartan because of the winter school. It is an extremely good example of what the interdepartmental group would have found in terms of high standards in a place that needs them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> Adventure centres are only beginning to happen in Ireland and there is potential all around our coast and throughout the country. It is important that we take a strong line in relation to safety. Everyone deserves a safe environment in which to enjoy themselves and a decent chance to avail of a recreational opportunity. Given that the main provisions in the Bill provide for the standards authority, which will be made up of 15 members, it will be important that there is a variety of interests on the board. I agree a teamwork approach should be taken. I smiled when I heard Deputy Dukes give out, in a sense, that the Minister had taken on a very superior role in that he would be able to fire members of the authority or even its director and not have to explain his actions. Deputy Dukes gave me the distinct impression that he assumed a Fianna Fáil Minister would be in place forever more. I thank him for his commendation of the current Government and his endorsement that we will be in this situation for quite some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people are perplexed that in this Celtic tiger economy there has been such a breakdown in our health services. There are waiting lists for all sorts of illnesses, and we hear of delays even where patients require emergency operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most extraordinarily long lists is in relation to orthodontic treatment in the Dublin area. I raise on the Adjournment as a last resort a case I want to bring to the attention of the House. I have fought for more than two years to get the young lady in question the dental treatment that she has been diagnosed as needing for more than seven and a half years. When the young lady was ten, the dental service attending the primary school in which she was a pupil indicated that she needed orthodontic treatment, and she was put on a list. When she was 13 or 14 I met her mother on a walkabout in the area in which she lives, Drumcondra, Dublin 9, which is the Taoiseach's constituency, as it is mine. This young lady's parents have been to the Taoiseach and to others in the effort to get dental treatment for her. It took me the best part of a year to get her an appointment to be assessed, and that assessment was done two years ago. Her parents contacted me again to thank me for getting the assessment and said they had been given to understand that their daughter <Col N="694" /> would have been treated by now. I was amazed to hear that she had not been treated.</P>
    <P>I have had the most extraordinary difficulty in tracking down who in the health board was responsible for this service, but it appears nobody is because of the mess the Government has made of the health boards in the Dublin region. Even when there was only one health board, the Eastern Health Board, it was difficult to get information. The reorganisation into an Eastern Regional Health Authority and three area health boards, has given rise to the most convoluted problems even in tracking down somebody to talk to. That is especially true if the person happens to live in one health board and the service they seek is provided in another health board area.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, and the Eastern Regional Health Board. I have been in touch with health centres and dental headquarters, with the dental service in St. James's Hospital, which it took me two weeks to get through to on the telephone. I have been misled several times. I have been told to ring Roselawn Health Centre, St. James's Hospital, and the headquarters of the Northern Area Health Board in Swords.</P>
    <P>After weeks of effort on my part as a Dáil Deputy, I eventually spoke to the deputy chief executive. One can only imagine the difficulties ordinary citizens must have. After all that effort, I was told by a senior person in the dental service at St. James's that the health board might pay most of the cost. Then I got some data on it, to the effect that a scheme might be introduced whereby the patient would pay 50% of the cost. I understand that scheme is not yet in operation. In any event my constituent cannot afford it. I received a letter from the deputy chief executive of the Northern Area Health Board in the past few weeks &ndash; seven and a half years after my constituent was first diagnosed &ndash; informing me that it will be another six months before it will be possible to say when she can have an appointment and, at that stage, she might be told she can have an appointment in 2002 or in 2003 or in 2004. This is a disgrace and I want the Minister to account to this House and tell me when this girl and others like her will get their treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for raising this matter and for allowing me this opportunity to discuss the provision of orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for providing services to this young girl rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Inquiries have been made of the ERHA and the Minister has been advised that the person was placed on the category II orthodontic assessment waiting list in November 1994. High priority cases &ndash; category I &ndash; are dealt with on a priority basis. She was assessed and deemed eligible for treatment by the authority in February 1999 but, due in part to the loss of qualified <Col N="695" /> orthodontic staff, there were delays in providing orthodontic treatment. The ERHA has advised the Minister that it hopes to issue this young person with an appointment in the coming weeks</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of the Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, the Minister asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services, of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised the Minister of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: an additional consultant orthodontist has been appointed and the recruitment of another two consultant orthodontists is currently in train&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise public concern about the deteriorating industrial relations situation at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. On 14 March 2001 the hospital management was informed by the INO that theatre nurses would no longer provide excessive on-call cover for out-of-hours service. These nurses are paid £13.30 for being on-call for a night. Most of them are job-sharing and yet they do the equivalent on-call duty a full-time nurse does. The contribution of these nurses is such that it is clear that the withdrawal of their services would create a significant risk to emergency patient care. Only by the hospital authorities fully addressing the issues raised by the nurses could patient care be safeguarded. Regrettably, this has not happened.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of getting into the area of industrial relations. I know meetings were held between management and the INO and that the Labour Relations Commission was involved and that action was suspended for a while. Despite any efforts that have been made, there has not been a resolution of the ongoing dispute and this is causing grave concern among the public and professionals working in the hospital, particularly now we are facing a deterioration in services.</P>
      <P>Last weekend there was no on-call cover available and this Tuesday there was no on-call cover either. The hospital arrangements for emergencies during those times is to have an ambulance available to transfer patients to other hospitals like St. Vincent's. This is totally unsatisfactory. The patient may not be able to sustain the journey to another hospital and even when the patient can, there is no guarantee that a hospital as busy as St. Vincent's will be able to attend to that patient on arrival. We all know the horror stories of patients lying on trolleys for days in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to deal with this issue increases the pressure on other hospitals as well as heightening the level of danger should a major emergency occur in Wicklow. This dispute is not only affecting the capability of the hospital to respond to out-of-hours emergencies but creates problems for operations during the day. Admittance to the <Col N="697" /> accident and emergency department can similarly be curtailed. This situation is so serious that I understand there have been reported requests from medical professionals to close down the accident and emergency department altogether as a safety precaution rather than put the public at risk.</P>
    <P>From this Friday, if the dispute is not resolved, it is expected that there will be no out-of-hours cover for the following ten consecutive days. We are entering a new and worrying phase during which the risks for people in County Wicklow and south County Dublin are increasing rather than lessening. It is vital that everything is done to resolve this dispute quickly. The Labour Court usually takes four to six weeks before hearing a case but we cannot wait that long. I ask the Minister for Health and Children with the senior management of the Eastern Health Board to co-operate with the INO in reaching a settlement in the interest of patients and the professionals who care for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, to clarify the position regarding out-of-hours theatre cover by nursing staff at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. The Minister has been informed by the East Coast Area Health Board that on 14 March 2001 the Irish Nurses Organisation advised that job-sharing theatre nurses who were &ldquo;currently providing double the rate of on call cover that their full-time colleagues were providing&rdquo; would refrain from doing so with immediate effect. Following telephone discussion with the INO it was agreed that this action would be deferred until a meeting had been arranged to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>At a meeting on 4 April it became apparent that the issue was not &ldquo;excessive on-call duties&rdquo; but rather the rate of remuneration for on-call. The INO tabled a demand seeking substantial increases over the existing national rates payable to theatre nurses for on-call work and for telephone rental refunds for nurses providing on-call cover.</P>
      <P>Local management advised that there was no difficulty with the concession of telephone rental refunds but that increases in nationally agreed rates could not be negotiated locally. Local hospital management requested that nursing staff continue to provide on-call cover pending discussions with the industrial relations section of the East Coast Area Health Board. The INO refused to co-operate in this.</P>
      <P>On 6 April 2001 the employee relations officer of the East Coast Area Health Board, together with hospital management, met the INO and sought agreement to the restoration of on-call cover by job &ndash; sharers pending the outcome of more detailed discussions and negotiations. Again the INO refused to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the East Coast Area Health Board, the Labour Relations Commission invited both parties to a conciliation conference which <Col N="698" /> took place on 11 April 2001. The Labour Relations Commission representative offered to fast track the INO's proposal to a hearing of the Labour Court provided the previous level of on-call cover was restored in the interim. Once again, the INO refused to co-operate.</P>
    <P>A further conciliation conference was held on 27 April in the offices of the Labour Relations Commission. At this conference the INO gave an undertaking &ldquo;to come off action and to stay off action for the duration of proceedings&rdquo;. Both parties agreed to explore settlement options and another conciliation conference was scheduled for Friday 4 May. Unfortunately, the parties failed to reach agreement at conciliation on 4 May and the Commission agreed to refer the matter to the Labour Court and to request an early hearing. The health board representatives left the talks under the clear impression that the INO commitment to stay off action was still in place and that all parties were committed to resolving their difficulties through the normal industrial relations machinery. Management was thus surprised and disappointed when the INO served notice of their intention to resume their action later that evening. The industrial action began on Friday 11 May at 4.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The lack of on-call cover in theatre has led to restrictions in the provision of accident and emergency services at St. Columcille's Hospital. On-call cover is normally provided from 4:30 p.m. each day. On days when no on-call cover is available, the accident and emergency department is only in a position to accept medical patients. On these days arrangements are in place to divert patients requiring surgical intervention to other hospitals in the area. An ambulance is also on stand-by at all times to ensure the rapid transfer of any patient in the hospital developing a need for surgical intervention.</P>
    <P>St. Columcille's Hospital and the East Coast Area Health Board are very aware of the additional pressures this dispute places on hospital services in south east Dublin and east Wicklow and have been anxious to engage in meaningful discussions with the INO in order to reach agreement and a restoration of full on-call cover to the operating theatres at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that a meeting with the INO has been scheduled for Monday next, 21 May. The health board hopes progress can be made at this meeting and that the INO will agree to call off its industrial action and allow the Labour Court proceed with a hearing on the substantive issues. The Minister encourages all parties to seek a flexible and effective solution to this dispute through the Labour Court's objective arbitration. On behalf of the Minister I call on the INO to call off its industrial action pending the outcome of the Labour Court hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against development but I welcome the construction of a national road network which is sensible and sensitive to those it affects. The network should deliver <Col N="699" /> greater potential for national economic development. However, when purchasing land by compulsory purchase order for this we must be prepared to compensate farmers and landowners based on the market value relative to the price of development land. This land is being used for the greater good and Government policy should be biased towards those from whom we are taking the land. I therefore ask that the price of compulsory purchase orders be related to market value. Also, capital gains tax should be abolished in such cases or a system introduced to make this process fairer for all concerned.</P>
      <P>The compulsory purchase order mechanism must be overhauled and made more user-friendly, with all costs being borne by the State through the local authority or the NRA. In this regard, the ICMSA statement and document, together with the separate IFA document, should be considered in a special forum in order to reach agreement between the Government and the farming organisations on this issue. I ask the Minister, as part of that learning process, to conduct a ministerial inquiry into the Norris case in Kilkenny. A man was forced to fight against the local county council and the NRA for his rights and those of his family. There is a need to establish the real facts in this case, to ensure that the man involved is adequately compensated and that a new home is provided for his family. It was an act of lunacy to build a wall within arm's length of his home and it is grossly unjust that his reasonable request to protect his livelihood and quality of life has not been granted. His case has been taken up by the Ombudsman in a special way. I understand the county council's report contains inaccuracies and misinformation. I have asked locally for this to be corrected and for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to take a special interest in this case as there is a lot be learned. The case could be used as a model to develop better understanding at national level.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why this Parliament keeps the NRA at arm's length as it is a body that spends vast sums of money. I believe Members should be allowed to scrutinise the process of compulsory purchase and that processes of this nature should be generally subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The bypass of Johnstown and Urlingford, along the N9 across north Kilkenny, is a source of deep concern to local communities in counties Carlow and Kilkenny. Before we enter the process of compulsory purchase for the construction of the road, I ask that a protocol be put in place to ensure that communities, landowners and farmers in these areas can avail of a modern mechanism to reach a reasonable price. Accommodation should be reached in terms of what the local community might lose as a result of the construction of this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compulsory order system should include a method of mediation prior to the purchase. Oral hearings, with no costs to farmers or land owners should be held. A modern compulsory purchase <Col N="700" /> order system acknowledging bias towards the rights of farm and land owners should be put in place as a matter of urgency. The standard legal charges should also be examined to reduce the cost to the State and others of employing legal aid or a professional to prove the case of the land owner. There should be an ombudsman for compulsory purchase orders so that if systems fail there is at least another safeguarding mechanism to which farmers and land owners can appeal.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the abolition of capital gains tax, which would be another method of compensating those involved. It should be remembered that the construction of roads under the National Development Plan will benefit not only local and regional economies but the national economy too. The farmers and land owners in question do not put their land up for sale and they do not want to go out of business or to give up their land. Consequently, I believe we should accommodate a new compulsory purchase order system forthwith before any more construction is undertaken on the N9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this matter this evening and for giving me an opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>The legislative code governing the compulsory purchase of land by local authorities covers all such acquisitions relating to any of the authorities' powers and duties including road construction. The procedures are designed to ensure a full and independent assessment of the local authorities' proposal and the views of the affected land owners. Local authorities also acquire land by agreement, but if it cannot be reached with land owners or if there are complications in relation to title for large schemes involving a number of land owners, acquisition usually occurs by compulsory purchase order.</P>
      <P>The scale of the national development plan both in terms of the number and size of infrastructural projects, particularly road construction, has brought the compulsory purchase process to greater public attention. The large number of schemes designed to address national infrastructural deficits means many people are affected. Modern high class roads with interchanges require a large take of land. The compulsory purchase system is designed to secure fair compensation for land owners. The Government is committed to ensuring the system operates efficiently and that decisions are made in a timely manner. The new procedures introduced in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, where the powers of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government were transferred to An Bórd Pleanála will help in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a basic principle that land owners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible. Compensation is composed of a number of elements, but the fundamental point to be borne in mind is that land owners get the <Col N="701" /> market value of the land. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and injurious affection which, in certain circumstances, would exceed the land value element of the total compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are catered for. If a dispute arises about compensation, the matter can be referred to an independent arbitrator for decision.</P>
    <P>The IFA has published proposals for reform of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land. In the context of the commitment in the PPF to the fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders, the proposals have been discussed by the IFA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. As these discussions are ongoing the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate to elaborate at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a fair and equitable compulsory purchase process. The Government also considers that value for money should be obtained and is determined that the national development plan be delivered on time and cost effectively so we can enjoy sustained economic growth and more balanced regional development. I will bring the points raised by Deputy McGuinness to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, for coming in at this late hour. I assure the Minister of State that I do not wish to discuss the strike taking place on two toll bridges in Dublin. I am concerned about issues that may result from the strike and the more general topic of tolling policy. The Minister of State is aware that traffic flow in this city is on a knife edge. The city just about functions in the best of circumstances when the sun shines, the main arteries have not been dug up, traffic signals operate and all other things go well. It may be at a slow pace and at a great cost to our economy and levels of personal stress, but things sometimes function. If any one of the factors I mentioned changes, for example, if a set of traffic lights breaks down, the traffic system collapses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin cannot and should not have to tolerate a diversion rate of 17% of traffic from the M50 to other local roads which are already congested. The diversion of traffic to other routes today and yesterday is a direct result of the warning to expect delays given by the management of national toll roads. Although I understand why such a warning was given, it is not acceptable that there should be any delays or at least no more delays than normal. The warning should be withdrawn and assurances given that if queues reach a certain level, barriers will be lifted to allow a free flow of traffic. I do not believe the fear of <Col N="702" /> the inability of management to collect money fast enough is an excuse to hold up traffic or divert it to other congested roads. This should especially not happen on the M50 which was constructed at enormous public expense and inconvenience.</P>
    <P>The Government receives several million pounds annually from the proceeds of toll bridges and has an obligation to direct national toll roads management to ensure the public does not suffer as a result of an internal industrial relations dispute. The most important point I wish to make to the Minister of State and which is pungently highlighted by this strike is the urgent need for a public debate on national tolling policy. As Deputy McGuinness mentioned, the National Roads Authority has earmarked 11 key national routes for construction through the PPP process from which the operators will recoup their portion of the investment by means of a toll.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to PPPs, the principle of tolling or the work of the NRA, but it is not right that an important issue such as a national tolling policy, particularly the conditions of such public private contracts should be left to an unaccountable body such as the NRA. The Government and all of us in the public sphere have an obligation to protect the public interest and to maintain the integrity of the national road network. To date there has not been any political input nor an opportunity for public scrutiny of the proposed contracts for these tolling contracts. Will the Minister of State arrange Dáil time or at least Dáil committee time to allow this matter to be discussed and for all of us to satisfy ourselves and the public that sufficient safeguards are in place to protect the public interest?</P>
    <P>I do not suggest the Dáil should get involved in contentious route selection processes or even in the principle of tolling. I do not want to delay road construction. I merely want to ensure that where tolling is to take place the public interest is protected. For instance, in many countries toll contracts provide that where queuing at toll barriers reaches a certain level the toll barrier lifts automatically to allow the free flow of traffic through. That was not included in the two tolling contracts we have as motorists find to their cost every morning and evening. That is something that should be included in future contracts.</P>
    <P>We must realise that in handing over control of our key national routes to private hands we are offering hostages to fortune. I do not dispute there may be benefits, but Members have an obligation to ensure future risks and exposure of motorists and the tax payer are minimised in respect of maintenance, operation policy, industrial disputes and costs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure this matter is brought to the Dáil for discussion before any further progress is made on the 11 routes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development. Some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing. In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. These new schemes, together with the pilot projects, will involve total estimated investment of more than £1,000 million with a potential private finance input of some £700 million.</P>
    <P>The national development plan stated clearly that the funding structures for PPP projects would include, where appropriate, road user tolls. The PPP approach based on user tolling, should bring worthwhile economies and innovation to Irish road design and guarantee efficiencies in procurement through the real transfer of risk.</P>
    <P>User tolls are in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are practically favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls, which are sometimes advocated as an alternative, and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls which would involve the State paying tolls on bridges, roads, etc., on the basis of usage, has not been ruled out, road user tolling, on the basis I explained, is more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
    <P>Motorists opting to pay tolls will receive a higher level of road service than those who choose to divert from the new roads. Alternative routes will remain available and choice will, therefore, be maintained.</P>
    <P>Motorists throughout Ireland are currently paying for the provision of road infrastructure regardless of whether they use it. Tolling of major new infrastructural projects will introduce a greater degree of equity into the financing and provision of road projects, as the end user, that is, the motorist who uses the road will pay for the cost of its provision rather than the public at large.</P>
    <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national <Col N="704" /> roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers on the tolling of non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ministerial approval is no longer required for toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters have been brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
    <P>In parallel, under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Roads Act, 1993, has been amended to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they are obliged to comply. Any such policy directives may not relate to particular tolling schemes and must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to the industrial dispute affecting the East and West Link bridges operated by National Toll Roads plc. The resolution of these industrial relations issues is properly a matter for the principal parties concerned, that is, the toll company and its employees. It is not for the Government or the public authorities to become directly involved in this IR process. The road authorities concerned will monitor the situation and take up with the toll company any measures they consider necessary to protect the interest and convenience of motorists.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the East and West Link bridges are public roads and as such must be kept opened to the public. I very much regret any inconvenience caused as a result of the dispute and I strongly appeal to the parties concerned to resolve it quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear in the NDP its plans for considerably greater use of user tolling in the implementation of the current national roads programme. That approach is now being taken forward by the NRA and I am confident it will improve the efficiency and the speed of delivery of the national roads programme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 May 2001.</P>

      <P>Under the protocol on direct payments to farmers, as agreed with the farming bodies, my Department is committed to paying the 2000 extensification premium in June 2001.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the current difficulties being experienced by farmers, it is hoped to commence extensification premium payments within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>In line with EU rules and charter commitments, it is anticipated that payments will be completed in all eligible cases by 30 June 2001.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the changes introduced under Agenda 2000 have implications for the payment of extensification premia. For the first time, farmers had to indicate on a special form that they wished to be considered for the 2000 extensification premium. Producers, who so indicated, had to opt for the simplified system or census system for determining their stocking density.</P>
      <P>All the data from the five census dates in respect of the 64,000 farmers who opted for the census system had to be collated and processed together with data from any ewe premium applications from those farmers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the forage area used for extensification premium purposes also differs from the forage area used for the payment of the suckler cow and special beef premia.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the foregoing, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the complexity of the work involved in the calculation of the 2000 extensification premium and payments cannot issue until all EU checks and controls have been applied.</P>

      <P>The number of producers penalised for irregularities under the 1999 and 2000 ewe premium schemes was 1,599 and 1,804 respectively.</P>
      <P>The 2001 ewe premium applications have not yet been processed. However, given the unacceptable situation highlighted in the detailed assessment of applications in the Cooley area of County Louth my Department is putting in place a range of additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. I will be availing of all mechanisms to tackle head-on any unacceptable practices unearthed in Cooley or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Because of the foot and mouth disease problem it has not been possible to carry out the normal level of on-farm inspections under the scheme this year. Under arrangements agreed with the European Commission, member states affected by the FMD problem must put alternative controls in place. These involve <i>inter alia</i>, cross checks against databases in the case of bovine schemes and, in the case of the ewe premium scheme, documentary checks which may be conducted on the spot or by administrative means. In conducting the control checks for ewe premia, I have asked my officials to pay particular attention to sheep slaughter data in meat plants and to details of movements under the permit arrangements introduced on 3 March last. On the spot follow-up inspections will be carried out in appropriate cases. Payments will not issue under the 2001 ewe premium scheme in advance of satisfactory completion of all of the checking arrangements. Penalties will be applied where irregularities are found and in cases of possible fraud, the gardaí will be involved.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the introduction this month of individual sheep tagging will minimise the risk of fraudulent applications in the future. This is essential if the interests of the vast majority of our farmers and those of Irish and European taxpayers are to be fully assured.</P>

      <P>Commission Decision 2001/145/EC of 21 February 2001 prohibited the exportation of raw and untreated meat from the United Kingdom. My Department, in association with other relevant Departments and agencies, immediately introduced arrangements at ports, airports, Border crossings, etc. to prevent the importation of these and other products. In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland at the request of my Department issued a notice to <Col N="707" /> retailers requesting them to withdraw from their shelves all raw and untreated meat imported from 1 February 2001. I am not aware of any illegal imports of raw meat since 21 February last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>Payments made to sheep farmers in the past 12 months related to entitlements under the 2000 ewe premium and 2000 sheep headage scheme in disadvantaged areas. No payments have been made in respect of the 2001 ewe premium scheme. The sheep headage scheme in disadvantaged areas has been replaced this year with a new area based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The position is that 40,368 sheep producers were paid a total of £77.6 million including rural world premia of £18.2 million under the 2000 ewe premium scheme. In addition 26,209 of those producers in disadvantaged areas were paid a total of £21.7 million under the 2000 sheep headage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the ewe premium scheme sheep farmers are paid a premium for maintaining a flock of ewes. To be paid, producers must hold a quota right for each ewe on which premium is claimed. A farmer may not be paid on more than the allocated quota. The ewes applied on must be in the ownership and possession of the applicant at the time of application and must be maintained at a specified location for a period of 100 days from the closing date for receipt of applications. All applications are subjected to administrative and on-farm controls as required under EU regulations. A minimum of 10% of applications are selected for on-farm inspection each year and these cases are selected using risk analysis. Up to 70% of all on-farm inspections are unannounced. However, in mountain commonage areas a maximum of 48 hours notice is given as provided for in EU regulations because of the difficulties in assembling sheep for inspection in these areas. Producers not selected for on-farm inspection are asked each year to confirm the number of sheep on their holding towards the end of the retention period as well as details of any sheep lost or disposed of since application. All the controls, both administrative and on the spot, are carried out within the retention period. Under EU regulations penalties are applied where it is found that the number of sheep applied on are not maintained for the retention period. There is a sliding <Col N="708" /> penalty scale but if the difference between the number of ewes declared or the quota held, whichever is lesser, and the number found exceeds 20% of the number found no premium is payable for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration through serious negligence are excluded from the scheme for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration intentionally are excluded from the scheme for that year and the following year. The number of producers penalised for irregularities under the 1999 and 2000 ewe premium scheme was 1,599 and 1,804 respectively. Under the sheep headage scheme 1,222 farmers attracted penalties in 1999 while 1,201 farmers were penalised in 2000.</P>
    <P>Given the unacceptable situation highlighted in the detailed assessment of applications in the Cooley area of County Louth my Department is putting in place a range of additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. I will be availing of all mechanisms to tackle head-on any unacceptable practices unearthed in Cooley or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Because of the foot and mouth disease problem it has not been possible to carry out the normal level of on-farm inspections under the scheme this year. Under arrangements agreed with the European Commission, member states affected by the FMD problem must put alternative controls in place. These involve <i>inter alia</i>, cross checks against databases in the case of bovine schemes and, in the case of the ewe premium scheme documentary checks which may be conducted on the spot or by administrative means. Payments will not issue under the 2001 ewe premium scheme in advance of satisfactory completion of all of the checking arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the introduction this month of individual sheep tagging will minimise the risk of fraudulent applications in the future. This is essential if the interests of the vast majority of our farmers and those of Irish and European taxpayers are to be fully assured.</P>

      <P>The first phase of the fallen animal collection scheme was put in place by my Department on 1 December 2000 when the gate fee was removed for ruminant fallen animal material delivered to a dedicated SRM rendering plant and the State undertook the full cost of rendering and destruction of the final product. This has proven to be very successful with large quantities of fallen animal material being delivered to <Col N="709" /> the dedicated rendering plant. In addition, a second plant based in Galway was approved in late March to take and process fallen animals and will contribute to the efficiency of the collection service.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the scheme involving a subsidised collection charge at farm level is currently under negotiation. The aim of this phase of the scheme is to further increase the number of animals being collected and to reduce the number of licensed burials. I am hopeful that this element of the scheme can be implemented at an early stage.</P>

      <P>Cattle breed improvement activities in Ireland have now been centralised under the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which incorporates the functions formerly carried out by my Department, AI organisations, milk recording and breed societies. ICBF was set up on an interim basis in 1997 with the support of funding and other forms of assistance from my Department. A permanent structure for the organisation and of the co-operative was established in July of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception, ICBF has placed a high priority on genetic improvement of the national beef herd. A comprehensive study of breeding objectives and schemes was completed in 1998. Plans for the future of beef cattle breeding were announced in November of last year following <Col N="710" /> widespread consultation with the industry. These plans provide for an enhanced system of performance recording and genetic evaluations in co-operation with its member organisations. Information from a number of sources will be combined through the ICBF database. There are also plans for increased international co-operation in beef cattle breeding to provide the best possible information for Irish herdowners.</P>
    <P>Further to the efforts of ICBF, Teagasc has intensified its efforts to promote the development of quality breeding by producers. Last year, a series of Teagasc road shows provided clear guidance for producers on heifer replacement strategies essential for the production of quality beef. This was further emphasised at the Teagasc exhibition at last year's ploughing championship.</P>
    <P>In addition to genetic improvement, the quality of Irish beef cattle can be upgraded through better feeding, husbandry and general farm management practices. These can all be encouraged through an effective graded pricing system at meat factory level. Some progress is being made in this regard but I would like to see more effective differentials introduced.</P>

      <P>Following the confirmation of the first case of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain on 21 February 2001, I made immediate arrangements to prohibit the importation of live animals of susceptible species and of certain animal based products from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also made immediate arrangements to mobilise Garda and Army resources and to assign Departmental staff to police the new regime along the Border with Northern Ireland and elsewhere. In addition, procedures for disinfection were put in place at Border crossings and elsewhere. On 23 February I announced that limited imports of live animals and animal based products allowed under the relevant legislation would be restricted to 30 designated Border crossings, all of which would be manned on a permanent basis, until further notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This regime is still in place and I am satisfied that the system of controls established along the Border, including those relating to disinfection, have worked well, and are continuing to work well. In this regard I understand that automatic spray units have been deployed at almost all approved crossing points at which they can be <Col N="711" /> safely accommodated, and that two additional units are on order at present. These arrangements are likely to remain in place for so long as the situation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland poses a threat.</P>

      <P>As regards the milk sector, the regime required in milk processing establishments under the provisions of Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996, is not a formal HACCP system.</P>
      <P>In practice, however, most establishments &ndash; and certainly all of the larger ones &ndash; have implemented a formal HACCP. All milk processing establishments are inspected at regular intervals by my Department, based on risk assessment and in accordance with the terms of the FSAI contract. During 2000 a total of 743 inspections were carried out. Some six major and 357 minor non-compliances were identified. It is not the practice to categorise non-compliances as between those involving the HACCP and those involving other aspects of the establishment's operations.</P>
      <P>In relation to the meat sector, the HACCP system applies in the meat products, minced meat and meat preparations plants. The inspection system in the export approved abattoirs under the control of my Department is based on permanent presence of veterinary inspectors employed directly or contracted to my Department, backed up by Department technical officers. The overall number of meat plants which apply HACCP comes to 72. In these plants, the number of non-compliance incidents during 2000 came to 185 in all. These were assessed on the basis of risk assessment and varied from minor incidents where timeframes for corrective action were given by the inspecting veterinary officer to more serious matters which resulted in total suspension or closure of certain parts of the plant for whatever period was required to put the matter right.</P>

      <P>The overall food safety standards governing the production of food, including the requirements for inspection of food production processes, are set in EU legislation and have been transposed into national law. Additionally, in relation to quality standards, there are various schemes, many operated on a voluntary basis, which offer consumers standards above the minimum legally required.</P>

    <P>Ireland, together with the other EU member states, is currently considering proposals published by the EU Commission to revise and consolidate Community legislation in relation to food hygiene along with the production, control and marketing of products of animal origin and animal health issues in relation to the production of those products. Among the objectives of the Commission for these proposals is to ensure that there is a legal basis for official controls throughout the food sector. In all, 17 directives dating back to 1964 will be revised in four proposed new regulations that will provide for hygiene of foodstuffs, hygiene of food of animal origin, animal health rules governing the production, marketing <Col N="713" /> and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption and controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to launch this report at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2000.</P>
      <P>Since the report was published my Department commissioned ESRI to produce more up to date figures on poverty in farm, rural non-farm and urban households. Details of the results of this research were published recently in the Department's annual review and outlook for 2000-01. They show that farm households have a lower risk of poverty than rural non-farm and urban households for almost all of the measures of relative and consistent poverty which are normally used. The core national poverty target is stated in terms of consistent poverty at the 60% relative income line. On this measure, farmers have a 4.8% risk of poverty compared with 8.1% for non-farm rural households and 8.2% for urban households.</P>
      <P>In relation to considering the restructuring of direct payments in light of the report's findings, the premia in the cattle and sheep sectors are agreed at EU level and are designed to compensate producers for low prices and I believe are suitable to the farming structure in this country.

      <P>Some legal restric<Col N="714" /> tions on exports of live cattle within the EU were lifted on 19 April in respect of Ireland and on 30 April in respect of the 10 kilometre exclusion zone in County Louth. There are other issues relating to the transport of animals through member states and to the specific guarantees required by importing veterinary authorities which remain to be resolved. With regard to livestock exports to third countries and while the import requirements are a matter strictly for the country in question, the situation generally is subject to OIE guidelines. These stipulate, as a minimum, a three month period free of foot and mouth disease before disease free status can be restored. Assuming that no further outbreaks occur in Ireland, we will recover our disease free OIE status on 22 June next.</P>
      <P>My Department is in contact with our various markets with a view to the earliest possible resumption of the live trade.</P>
      <P>On pigmeat, important markets in the United States and Japan were lost due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. While every effort is being made to reopen those markets, and contacts have already taken place, much will depend on Ireland recovering its international disease free status towards the end of June. As regards milk products, my Department together with the Department of Foreign Affairs has succeeded in having export restrictions lifted in all key export markets. Any outstanding bans on Irish dairy products will be tackled in a similar manner to ensure normal trade flows are resumed.</P>
      <P>The only beef export market affected by the recent FMD crisis was Russia. The majority of our non-European markets had been closed to Irish beef exports as a result of the BSE crisis in Europe late last year. The task of recovering those markets is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product and, with that in mind, my Department has been in ongoing contact or in correspondence with the relevant authorities in those countries which have been significant markets for Irish beef to point out to them the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Egypt is our largest market for beef and much of our effort in recovering export markets has been focused on Egypt. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year, the most recent being at the end of April and I also took the opportunity earlier this month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation. Another important market is Saudi Arabia and a senior veterinary official of my Department travelled last January to Riyadh to brief the authorities there on our BSE controls. I am satisfied that the Egyptian and Saudi authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, <Col N="715" /> the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases last year.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to Russia is that Ireland had been banned as a source of supply following our FMD outbreak. Prior to this I had invited the Russian Minister for Agriculture and the Chief Veterinary Officer, both of whom were newly appointed to their posts late last year, to visit Ireland to see for themselves the level and effectiveness of the BSE controls in place. This invitation still stands. The Irish Embassy in Moscow and An Bord Bia are maintaining close contact with the Russian authorities on the earliest possible resumption of trade in beef.</P>
    <P>In the case of Lebanon, the situation is that contact has been ongoing with the authorities there on reopening the live trade. A proposed veterinary health certificate has now been submitted to the Lebanese authorities which, if acceptable, should open the way for the resumption of this important trade.</P>
    <P>While every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to reopen third country markets to Irish beef and livestock, it is, however, clear that a restoration of exports to those markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <P>The expert group <Col N="716" /> which I established to advise me on FMD measures has indicated that a resumption of farm visits by officers of my Department in connection with the on-farm investment schemes can be recommenced. However, the need for continued vigilance and inspection at Border crossings with Northern Ireland and at the ports of entry make it necessary to retain a significant number of Departmental officials on this work for some time yet.</P>
      <P>As officers are released from FMD work they are being reassigned new duties on the basis of priority assessment.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the case of on-farm investment schemes including investment aid for farm waste management some 1,000 applications are awaiting pre-approval. Some 500 pre-payment inspections for on-farm investment schemes are also being held up. I am fully conscious of the economic effect the delays in necessary inspections are having on individual farmers and I am keeping the re-assignment programme under constant review.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise to stand down the full Department inspectorate from Border and port FMD duties at this time given the extensive and successful efforts that have been made to prevent spread of FMD in Ireland in recent months. The re-assignment of staff must be done on the basis of best risk management practice while bearing in mind the need to resume normal Departmental activity in the various EU and national farming schemes as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I have received a submission from the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland entitled Food for the Future. One proposal in that submission is the establishment of a task force to examine the small abattoir sector. That proposal, along with the other issues raised in the submission, is currently being examined within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to abattoirs generally is that, under EU regulations, those slaughtering more than 1,000 livestock units per annum must comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1997. Smaller abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are licensed by my Department under the Abattoirs Act, 1988. They are derogated from certain structural provisions of the EU directives. They are, however, required to achieve a range of standards regard<Col N="717" /> ing hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. These are minimum standards required by EU legislation.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector. However, given the absolute priority of food safety and the protection of the consumer, my Department must ensure that the regulations designed to achieve these objectives are fully complied with, irrespective of the size of the establishment. Once licensed by my Department, the operation of day-to-day controls in domestic abattoirs is a matter for the relevant local authority under the overall control of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Applications for second-year or subsequent annual REPS payments are processed in accordance with my Department's commitments under the protocol on direct payments to farmers. Compliance inspections are no longer related to these applications and consequently the annual payments were not affected by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>A proportion of new applications for REPS are subject to pre-payment inspection, however. This involves a farm check. My Department was obviously very much aware of the difficulties the foot and mouth restrictions placed on the farming community. However, this had to be balanced against the controls needed to maintain the integrity of the scheme and protect my Department's accreditation as a paying agency. My Department had made proposals to the EU Commission, and special measures were approved by the Commission in a regulation published on 3 May applying to all member states affected by foot and mouth disease. Relaxation or removal of controls would not have been possible without such prior EU approval.</P>
      <P>In the event, I am happy to say that thanks to the national effort to contain the disease my Department is now in a position to carry out on-farm visits again. I understand that some delays in payments may occur in a small number of cases, but with the resumption of on-farm visits these are now being dealt with as a high priority and payments will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Legislation on food safety is determined at EU level. On 12 January 2000 the European Commission published a White Paper on Food Safety which proposed a strategy to achieve the highest possible standards of protection for the EU consumer. The proposed strategy involves two elements: a draft regulation establishing an independent European Food Authority and setting out the general principles of food law, and legislative programme of over 80 separate measures to be introduced over a period of three years or so.</P>
      <P>This programme includes measures in relation to food hygiene along with the production, control and marketing of products of animal origin and animal health issues in relation to the production of those products. In all, 17 directives dating back to 1964 will be revised in four proposed new regulations that will provide for: hygiene of foodstuffs, hygiene of food of animal origin, animal health rules governing the production, marketing and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption, and controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.</P>
      <P>My intention in negotiating these proposals is to ensure that the highest possible levels of public health protection in relation to all food production will apply.</P>
      <P>Work is proceeding at EU level on the proposed strategy with the aim, in particular, of establishing the European Food Authority by early 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> Over the last three months I have had a number of meetings with the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms. Bríd Rodgers, both within the North-South Ministerial Council and outside at which animal health issues were discussed. At a special meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held on 6 April to discuss the foot and mouth crisis, we agreed that officials of the two departments would develop a strategy for the control of animal movements on the island of Ireland drawing on work done in both jurisdictions, and in the light of the experience gained from the current foot and mouth disease outbreaks, consider the means of prevention, containment and eradication of future epizootic disease outbreaks on the island.</P>
    <P>An expert group was established by my Department to review quality assurance schemes in the food area and to make recommendations on how greater coherence and clarity might be achieved in this whole area for the ultimate benefit of the consumer and the food industry. The group has finalised its report and I will be making a public announcement on this matter very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already signalled, in the House and elsewhere, my intention to introduce without delay a comprehensive identification system for sheep, based on the individual identification of all sheep by tagging. This system will be called the National Sheep identification System, NSIS. My Department has virtually completed all the required preparatory work on this project and NSIS will go live and be operational nationally within the next few weeks. A full information pack on the detailed operation of NSIS will issue to farmers within the next week or so. I anticipate all elements of NSIS being in place within the current month, with a date in early June being specified as the date after which it will be illegal to trade in untagged sheep.</P>
      <P>Eight companies have been approved to supply tags to farmers. The process of ordering tags will be a very simple one for farmers and will involve a computer-based interaction between each supplier and the Department, whereby herd or flock numbers will be validated, numerical sequences of tags assigned and data on individual orders captured for monitoring purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under NSIS, sheep imported into the State from the UK including Northern Ireland or any <Col N="720" /> other member state and which are going onto a holding must be tagged with and retain a red import tag and must also retain the tag of origin. Imported sheep which are going direct to slaughter must retain the tags inserted in their ears in the member state from which they have been imported. Slaughter plants will be required, as part of NSIS, to read the tag of each sheep they accept for slaughter and to link in each case the tag number to the carcass number assigned to that animal.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of NSIS, Ireland will for the first time have a system capable of providing full traceability for all sheep, on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing, adherence to current and prospective EU requirements and the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum which reported in October 1999. I consider the introduction of NSIS to be a most important step and one on which we can build further advances as we move forward.</P>

      <P>Given the unacceptable situation highlighted in the detailed assessment of applications in the Cooley area of County Louth, my Department is putting in place a range of additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. I will be availing of all mechanisms to tackle head-on any unacceptable practices unearthed in Cooley or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Because of the foot and mouth disease problem it has not been possible to carry out the normal level of on-farm inspections under the scheme this year. Under arrangements agreed with the European Commission member states affected by the FMD problem must put alternative controls in place. These involve, <i>inter alia</i>, cross checks against databases in the case of bovine schemes and in the case of the ewe premium scheme documentary checks which may be conducted on the spot or by administrative means. The controls will also focus on sheep slaughter data in meat plants and on details of sheep movements under the permit arrangements introduced on 3 March 2001. On the spot follow-up inspections will be carried out in appropriate cases. Payments will not issue under the 2001 ewe premium scheme in advance of satisfactory completion of all of the checking arrangements. Penalties will be applied where irregularities are found and, in cases of possible fraud, the gardaí will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The task of recovering markets for Irish beef is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product. With that in mind, I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year, the most recent being at the end of April and I also took the opportunity earlier this month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Gulf States, a senior veterinary official of my Department visited Saudi Arabia in January to assure the Saudi authorities on the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland. Both the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, in the course of recent official visits to Oman and Bahrain availed of the opportunity to brief officials in those countries on the BSE situation in Ireland. I am satisfied that the Egyptian and Saudi authorities, being the major markets in the region, have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland and of the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to Russia is that while there are county restrictions in place, Ireland had been free to trade in beef up until our FMD outbreak which led to the imposition of a ban. I had invited the Russian Minister for Agriculture and the Russian Chief Veterinary Officer, both of whom were newly appointed to their posts late last year, to visit Ireland to satisfy themselves as to the level and effectiveness of the BSE controls in place in Ireland. These invitations still stand. The Irish Embassy in Moscow <Col N="722" /> and An Bord Bia are maintaining close contact with the Russian authorities with a view to re-opening trade at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>While every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to re-open third country markets to Irish beef and livestock, it is, however, clear that a restoration of exports to those markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <P>In view of the quota difficulties arising for many producers from the foot and mouth disease restrictions I am now adopting a prudent approach on the definitive allocation of the 11.5 million gallons.

Strict criteria will apply to these allocations.</P>
      <P>I have, however, decided to proceed with a permanent allocation of 1,300 gallons of quota to younger farmers from the Agenda 2000 quota.

      <P>Since 1988 my Department has operated a salmonella monitoring programme in poultry breeding flocks, table egg layers and poultry meat carcasses. The programme was set up as a voluntary code of practice with the co-operation of the various elements of industry. The programme sets out approved guidelines for the control of salmonella typhimurium &ndash; S.t. &ndash; and salmonella enteritidis &ndash; S.e. My information is that to date there has been very low incidence of salmonella typhimurium DT 104 in poultry.</P>
      <P>Both the Department and producers co-operate to ensure that a determination of the salmonella situation in cases of suspect flocks is made as quickly as possible. The owner of the flock is responsible for arranging slaughter of the flock. Once the house in question has been emptied of birds, effective cleaning and disinfection is carried out, including safe disposal of manure and litter and effective vermin control, as directed by a Department official. Restocking may take place only after official clearance has been granted and may only be sourced from flocks that are shown to be free of salmonella on the basis of a recognised monitoring programme.</P>

      <P>Since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, I have made numerous <Col N="727" /> public statements on the actual and potential market impacts of the disease. In particular, I and my officials have regularly provided detailed information on the reaction of foreign markets as events have unfolded. My objective throughout the period has been to ensure trade continued to be possible whether by means of the adoption where possible of a regionalised approach to the outbreak or by the provision of appropriate certification. In that context my Department has worked in close collaboration with the industry.</P>
      <P>In terms of more general market trends, I have previously said that the advice available to me at this point indicates that the impact of FMD on the beef sector has been limited, due in large part to the fact that many foreign markets were already closed due to concerns about BSE and that the market is being supported by the purchase for destruction scheme. The interruption of normal slaughterings in the UK and Netherlands have created additional market opportunities for Irish beef in these countries. For sheepmeat there have also been some positive market impacts, because of the export ban on sheepmeat from the UK, and this has led to a significant rise in prices for Irish product. While the dairy sector was initially affected by some restrictions, most markets are accepting product based on suitable certification from my Department as to the origin, production process and heat treatment. Pig prices have now stabilised throughout the EU at quite a high level with good margins being obtained. While the FMD crisis has resulted in the banning of exports of Irish pigmeat to both Japan and USA, every effort will be made to restore our exports to these valuable third country destinations.</P>
      <P>As the crisis eases, the situation should broadly return to its pre-FMD trend.</P>

      <P>It has always been my policy to ensure unrestricted access to as many markets as possible for Irish beef and live cattle. Market possibilities are constantly explored and followed up by my Department, in conjunction with An Bord Bia. In the case of Lebanon, the situation is that contact has been ongoing with the authorities there on re-opening the live trade. A proposed veterinary health certificate has now been submitted to the Lebanese authorities which, if acceptable, should open the way for the resumption of this important trade.</P>
      <P>As regards trade in live animals within the EU, the situation is that some legal restrictions on exports of live cattle within the EU were lifted on 19 April in respect of Ireland and on 30 April in respect of the 10 km exclusion zone in County Louth. There are other issues relating to the transport of animals through member states and to the specific guarantees required by importing veterinary authorities which remain to be resolved. With regard to livestock exports to third countries and while the import requirements are a matter strictly for the country in question, the situation generally is subject to OIE guidelines. These stipulate, as a minimum, a three month period free of foot and mouth disease before disease free status can be restored. Assuming that no further outbreaks occur in Ireland, we will recover our disease free OIE status on 22 June next.</P>
      <P>My Department is in contact with our various markets with a view to the earliest possible resumption of the live trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef market in Ireland is satisfactory at present and has been since the beginning of the year. The main reason for this is the operation of the purchase for destruction scheme which has underpinned prices for over 30 month cattle. A more recent factor has been the foot and mouth situation in Britain and the Netherlands which has disrupted slaughtering in these countries and given rise to market opportunities for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme will be replaced from 1 July by a special purchase scheme which will not apply to steers. In this situation, the steer beef market will be supported through intervention and export refunds. I will be seeking to have these supports operate in a manner that will ensure a satisfactory return to our producers. I will be pressing this point strongly at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as price developments in the second half of the year are concerned, beef prices are due to <Col N="730" /> be reduced by 6.7% from 1 July under the Agenda 2000 agreement. However, premiums have been increased substantially to compensate producers for this reduction in prices. These premiums will be worth an additional £175 million or 20p/lb. to Irish producers this year compared to 1999.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the availability of third country markets will have a major influence on price developments in the second half of the year. In view of this, I will be using all of the diplomatic and other resources available to me to secure the re-opening of these third country markets which are currently closed because of BSE or FMD reasons. Egypt is particularly important in view of the size of that market for Irish beef. Senior officials of my Department have recently visited there to brief their counterparts on the range of controls that has been put in place to deal with BSE and foot and mouth disease both at EU and national level. Follow-up action is being taken by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>I am also targeting every other potential market opening and will do whatever is required to regain the position of Irish beef and cattle on any of our export markets which are closed to us.  </P>

      <P>I am not aware of any cases of equine viral arteritis in this country. The importation of horses is governed by Community legislation which establishes the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of equidae for breeding purposes from other members states and third countries. Under these conditions, the veterinary inspectorate in the competent authority of the country of departure has to certify that EVA has not been officially recorded in the animal during the last six months.</P>
      <P>Stallions used for mating in this country are tested for their EVA status prior to mating and, if found positive, they are not allowed to mate. In addition, only EVA-free stallions are registered with the Irish Horse Board. A common code of practice for the control of venereal diseases, including EVA, has been put in place in use by the breeding industry. These codes aim to help breeders minimise the risk of venereal disease in the horse population by making recommendations for disease prevention and control during the breeding season.</P>

The examination for approval has progressed through a number of the Commission procedural stages. My Department has provided additional information sought and is in ongoing negotiation with the Commission with a view to finalisation and obtaining approval of the operational programme within the next number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of selecting local rural development groups to deliver the programme is proceeding in parallel. The independent consultant contracted to assess the business plans submitted by groups by way of application to be considered for delivery of the programme is concluding the work and will make recommendations which will be taken into account by my Department's selection committee. It is expected that the selection committee will arrive at conclusions within a short time frame, having regard to the terms of the Commission's formal approval when received. I will then make a report to Govern<Col N="732" /> ment and the formal appointment of the appropriate number of groups will be decided by Government.</P>

      <P>Under the ewe premium scheme, sheep farmers are paid a premium for maintaining a flock of ewes. In order to be paid, producers must hold a quota right for each ewe on which premium is claimed. A farmer may not be paid on more than the allocated quota. The ewes applied on must be in the ownership and possession of the applicant at the time of application and must be maintained at a specified location for a period of 100 days from the closing date for receipt of applications. All applications are subjected to administrative and on-farm controls as required under EU regulations. A minimum of 10% of applications are selected for on-farm inspection each year and these cases are selected using risk analysis. Up to 70% of all on-farm inspections are unannounced. However, in mountain commonage areas, a maximum of 48 hours notice is given as provided for in EU regulations because of the difficulties in assembling sheep for inspection in these areas.  </P>
      <P>Producers not selected for on-farm inspection are asked each year to confirm the number of sheep on their holding towards the end of the retention period as well as details of any sheep lost or disposed of since application. All of the controls, both administrative and on-the-spot are carried out within the retention period. Under EU regulations, penalties are applied where it is found that the number of sheep applied on are not maintained for the retention period. There is a sliding penalty scale but if the difference between the number of ewes declared or the quota held, whichever is lesser, and the number found exceeds 20% of the number found no premium is payable for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration through serious negligence are excluded from the scheme for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration intentionally are excluded from the scheme for that year and the following year.</P>

      <P>Given the unacceptable situation highlighted in the detailed assessment of applications in the Cooley area of County Louth, my Department is putting in place a range of additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. I will be availing of all mechanisms to tackle head-on any unacceptable practices unearthed in Cooley or elsewhere. Due to the foot and mouth disease problem, it has not been possible to carry out the normal level of on-farm inspections under the scheme this year.  </P>
      <P>Under arrangements agreed with the European Commission, member states affected by the FMD problem must put alternative controls in place. These involve,<i> inter alia</i>, cross checks against databases in the case of bovine schemes and, in the case of the ewe premium scheme, documentary checks which may be conducted on-the-spot or by administrative means. Payments will not issue under the 2001 ewe premium scheme in advance of satisfactory completion of all of the checking arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the introduction this month of individual sheep tagging will minimise the risk of fraudulent applications in the future. This is essential if the interests of the vast majority of our farmers and those of Irish and European taxpayers are to be fully assured.</P>

      <P>The 2001 suckler premium scheme will remain open for applications until Friday, 29 June. This year for the first time, the scheme opened on 2 January and will remain open for the full six month period allowed under the regulations. In addition, applications will be accepted from producers for 25 days after the closing date but claims lodged after 29 June will be subject to a 1% penalty for each working day late.</P>
      <P>The foot and mouth disease restrictions are being gradually relaxed to allow a level of livestock trading. Following a recommendation from the expert group farm to farm sales are permitted under permit from Monday last. Producers should, therefore, be in a position to take the steps necessary to maintain their suckler cow herd.</P>
      <P>In addition, producers should note that they are permitted to apply for the suckler cow premium on heifers over eight months old. These animals may qualify for premium and can be used to fill the suckler cow quota usage requirements. The number of heifers allowed is limited to 20% of the overall number of animals declared.</P>
      <P>At this point, I do not consider it is necessary to extend the closing date for the suckler cow premium scheme. However, I intend to monitor matters on a weekly basis and the question of a closing date extension will be considered if matters deteriorate between now and 29 June. Any such extension of the closing date would require European Commission approval.</P>

      <P>Agriculture is one of the areas of co-operation with Northern Ireland identified under the Good Friday Agreement. The issues for discussion include animal health policy. The programme of work on animal health adopted by the North-South Ministerial Council in its agriculture sector format involved the formalisation of liaison arrangements at official level on animal health matters including the establishment of a strategic steering group which will co-ordinate animal health policy on the island and make regular reports on co-operation on animal health matters together with recommendations for policy and/or operational decisions to the NSMC. Policy working groups are also to be established which will initially explore eight areas of animal health which apply to the whole island. These groups will be stood down or new ones formed, as required.</P>
      <P>Over the last three months, I have had a number of meetings with Minister Bríd Rodgers, both within the North-South Ministerial Council and outside, and animal health issues were discussed at these meetings. At a special meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held on 6 April to discuss the foot and mouth crisis, we agreed that officials of our two Departments would develop a strategy for the control of animal movements on the island of Ireland drawing on work done in both jurisdictions; and, in the light of the experience gained from the current foot and mouth disease outbreaks, consider the means of prevention, containment and eradication of future epizootic disease outbreaks on the island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When my Department became aware of allegations in December 1997 that sheep from Northern Ireland and Great Britain were being slaughtered illegally in meat factories in Ireland, it immediately advised its veterinary staff at meat plants of the allegations and <Col N="736" /> asked them to review inspection procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that at the time the issue was raised, the entire island of Ireland had the same veterinary status which meant that, under EU regulations, sheep from Northern Ireland could be imported freely into Ireland without certification. In other words, from a veterinary point of view, the island as a whole was a single and free market for sheep. The position now is, of course, quite different in that there is a ban on imports from the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland because of the FMD situation there.</P>
      <P>My Department was aware, however, of possible VAT fraud and wrote to the Revenue Commissioners on 17 December 1997 asking them to undertake an investigation into the situation. This letter was followed up by further letters in February 1998. Later that year, the Department was informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they had uncovered VAT irregularities at two meat plants and that substantial settlements had been reached at those two plants.</P>
      <P>Following further representations from the IFA to my Department on 16 November 1998 about imports of sheep, my Department again issued a circular to its veterinary staff at all meat plants reminding them both of the import requirements and the need for vigilance in relation to sheep imported from Northern Ireland or Great Britain. My Department had already been in touch with the Revenue Commissioners in August 1998 on the VAT refund issue and had been informed that they intended to investigate all meat plants on an ongoing basis. The issue was also discussed in the sheep forum in December 1998. While the forum recognised the free movement of sheep on the island and also acknowledged the importance of the wider internal EU market, the introduction of a tagging and traceability system was suggested as a solution to the problem of illegal imports. However it proved impossible until recently to secure the agreement of producers and processors to the introduction of a sheep tagging system.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that my Department has endeavoured over the years, and well before the current FMD situation, to prevent illegal trade in cattle or sheep. However, in view of the fact that there is free trade in sheep between Ireland and Northern Ireland and against the backdrop until now of widespread resistance among producers and processors to the introduction of a sheep tagging system, the detection of illegal activity has been severely hampered.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is worth pointing out that the authorities responsible for implementing the law in this area &ndash; the Department, the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; are, as in all cases, highly dependent on the co-operation of the law abiding farmers to bring to their attention any illegal activities of which they are aware.</P>

      <P>I have already signalled, in the House and elsewhere, my intention to introduce without delay a comprehensive identification system for sheep, based on the individual identification of all sheep by tagging. This system will be called the national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS. My Department has virtually completed all the required preparatory work on this project and NSIS will go &ldquo;live&rdquo; and be operational nationally within the next few weeks. A full information pack on the detailed operation of NSIS will issue to farmers within the next week or so. I anticipate all elements of NSIS being in place within the current month, with a date in early June being specified as the date after which it will be illegal to trade in untagged sheep.</P>
      <P>Eight companies have been approved to supply tags to farmers. The process of ordering tags will be a very simple one for farmers and will involve a computer-based interaction between each supplier and the Department, whereby herd-flock numbers will be validated, numerical sequences of tags assigned and data on individual orders captured for monitoring purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of NSIS, Ireland will for the first time have a system capable of providing full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing, adherence to current and prospective EU requirements and the implementation of the rel<Col N="739" /> evant recommendations of the Sheepmeat Forum which reported in October 1999. I consider the introduction of NSIS to be a most important step and one on which I believe we can build further advances as we move forward.</P>

      <P>All area aid applications are processed by reference to herd numbers. When lodged in the Department, area aid applications are first scanned on to a document retrieval system. They are then data captured and registered. When farmers lodge an area aid application for the first time it is necessary, for control purposes, that the applicant's holding be inspected prior to the issue of a new herd number. These arrangements involve the area aid inspectorate and the local district livestock office which is responsible for issuing herd numbers. While it takes some time for all inspections to be completed, the timing is designed to facilitate the issue of payments to cereal farmers on 16 November. This year, as an emergency measure, it <Col N="740" /> has been necessary for my Department to redeploy staff to foot and mouth duties and, as a consequence, it is difficult to state precisely when inspections will be completed. Nevertheless, I will keep the matter under continuous review so that herd numbers can be issued as quickly as possible. It is also my intention to ensure that all payments, except, for problem cases, are made on time in accordance with the protocol on direct payments to farmers.</P>

      <P>There are no sanctions open under the insolvency payments scheme or the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991, in regard to the non-payment of wages, holiday pay or overtime owed to <Col N="741" /> employees when a company merely ceases to trade. To come within the provisions of those Acts and scheme, under which it is possible for eligible employees to claim certain amounts of outstanding pay-related entitlements of the type mentioned &ndash; wages, overtime, holiday pay, the company would have to be in liquidation or receivership or be covered by any of the other proceedings which define insolvency for the purposes of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991 and the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the event of the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991, not applying, it would be open to individual employees to pursue entitlements under the terms of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, and the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. The Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides a right of complaint to a rights commissioner for any employee who has had an unlawful deduction made from wages and this includes non-payment of wages. A complaint must be presented to a rights commissioner within six months of the non-payment, which gave rise to the complaint. Under section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, an employee is entitled to annual leave calculated as follows: four working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours &ndash; unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment; or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works 117 hours; or 8% of the hours he or she works in a leave year, subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks. If an employer refuses to grant an employee his/her annual leave entitlement the employee may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner for redress.</P>

      <P>As outlined in my reply to Priority Questions No. 84 and No. 85 of 30 January, there has been consensus among all EU member states on the need to respond to public concern regarding the use of depleted uranium. I am happy to confirm that it was in this context that the depleted uranium issue arose for discussion at the meeting to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The meeting in question took place in early January of this year and saw a number of EU partners, including Ireland, underline the importance of rapidly and clearly establishing the factual basis and parameters of the issue. Reference was also made to relevant international studies on the issue, including that by the UN environment programme, and it was agreed that matters should be kept under close review.</P>
      <P>Since then, my Department, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have actively monitored developments on this issue, including via the<i> ad hoc</i> special committee on depleted uranium which was established within the Partnership for Peace framework. The Deputy will doubtless be aware by now that a further report by the UN environment programme &ndash; UNEP &ndash; and a related World Health Organisation &ndash; WHO &ndash; report were published in March. In addition, a EURATOM expert opinion on the potential health effects of radiation from depleted uranium was issued under the aegis of the Commission. These studies found no detectable widespread contamination of the ground surface in Kosovo by depleted uranium. Likewise, no scientific evidence was found to link the use of depleted uranium to illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These findings were noted by EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting in April. In addition to encouraging the Commission to take these and other health or environmental issues into account in the context of <Col N="743" /> ongoing assistance to the Western Balkans region, it was agreed that the Council should remain committed to following possible further investigations closely and re-examining the issue if appropriate at a future stage.</P>
    <P>The EU is engaged in developing capabilities for the Petersberg tasks, that is peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. I can confirm that the issue of depleted uranium munitions has not arisen in that context.</P>

      <P>When the agreement with the Commission was implemented in 1999 as supplementary measure A of REPS  &ndash; now measure A in the new scheme &ndash; eligibility of commonage for payment was initially restricted to owned commonage declared for area aid in 1997.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were approximately 29,000 farmers involved in milk production during the 2000-01 milk quota year. I have emphasised on many occasions that the main focus of my policy in relation to the operation of the milk quota regime in Ireland is to provide additional quota to small and medium size producers on permanent basis and at a reasonable cost. My objectives are to improve the structure of milk production at producer level in Ireland and to make dairying a more efficient enterprise.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve these objectives, I introduced revised milk quota regulations with effect from April 2000. I also allocated the 20.5 million gallons of additional quota, available to Ireland as part of the 32 million gallons of additional quota which I successfully negotiated under the Agenda 2000 agreement, to small and medium size producers, including younger dairy farmers. The new provisions have already had a significant impact, in that the vast bulk of the 120 million gallons of milk quota, which was available for allocation on a temporary or permanent basis, was granted to small and medium size producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> Almost 60 million gallons was reallocated permanently under the 2000 restructuring scheme while a further 39 million gallons was leased under the temporary leasing scheme. Category I producers with a quota entitlement up to approximately 35,000 gallons benefited to the extent of 51 million gallons &ndash; or 52% of the total available &ndash; under these two schemes. Category II with a quota entitlement between 35,000 and 56,000 gallons, approximately, took up over 34 million gallons or 35% of quota under the schemes.</P>
    <P>The successful operation of these schemes, together with the allocation of additional quota from the 20.5 million gallon reserve, has had a significant impact on the structure of milk production in Ireland. The number of category II producers increased by 24% between 1999 and 2000 while the number of category I producers decreased by 21% during the same period.</P>
    <P>The new provisions also have provided the framework for the reduction of the price of restructured quota and temporary leased quota. The maximum price of restructured quota has been reduced by 23% from £1.60 per gallon in 1998 to approximately £1.23 per gallon &ndash; £0.27 per litre &ndash; in respect of the current year. Over the same period, the cost of temporary leased quota has been reduced by 36% to approximately £0.16 per gallon &ndash; £0.035 per litre.</P>
    <P>In addition to introducing a restructuring scheme and temporary leasing scheme with lower maximum prices and continued priority for small and medium size producers. I have recently announced that the small scale younger dairy farmers, who benefited from the additional quota under the five million gallon reserve will be granted a further 1,300 gallons effective from this quota year.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to give priority to small and medium size producers in the operation of the quota regime in Ireland in the future, in a way which also ensures the continued competitiveness of milk production by means of lower quota prices and leasing costs.</P>

      <P>The task of recovering markets for Irish beef is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product. With that in mind, I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in an effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke with President Mubarak on this matter. Further visits to Egypt were undertaken by officials of my Department this year, the most recent being at the end of April and I also took the opportunity earlier this month to raise the matter with a visiting Egyptian ministerial delegation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the Egyptian authorities have a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland and of the way in which it is dealt with and of the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. However, in many of our non-EU markets, and Egypt is a good example, the situation has been exacerbated by adverse public opinion as a result of sensationalised media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on the BSE developments in those EU countries which encountered their first cases last year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that every effort, both directly and through diplomatic channels, is being made to re-open the Egyptian market to Irish beef. It is, however, clear that a restoration of exports to markets such as Egypt is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <P>Payments made to sheep farmers in the last 12 months related to entitlements under the 2000 ewe premium and 2000 sheep headage scheme in disadvantaged areas. No payments have been made in respect of the 2001 ewe premium scheme. The sheep headage scheme in disadvantaged areas has been replaced this year with a new area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The position is that 40,368 sheep producers were paid a total of £77.6 million under the 2000 ewe premium scheme. In addition, 26,209 of those producers in disadvantaged areas were paid a total of £21.7 million under the 2000 sheep headage scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the ewe premium scheme, sheep farmers are paid a premium for maintaining a flock of ewes. In order to be paid, producers must hold a quota right for each ewe on which premium is claimed. A farmer may not be paid on more than the allocated quota. The ewes applied on must be in the ownership and possession of the applicant at the time of application and must be maintained at a specified location for a period of 100 days from the closing date for receipt of applications. All applications are subject to administrative and on-farm controls as required under EU regulations. A minimum of 10% of applications are selected for on-farm inspection each year and these cases are selected using risk analysis. Up to 70% of all on-farm inspections are unannounced. However, in mountain commonage areas a maximum of 48 hours notice is given as provided for in EU regulations because of the difficulties in assembling sheep for inspection in these areas. Producers not selected for on-farm inspection are asked each year to confirm the number of sheep on their holding towards the end of the retention period as well as details of any sheep lost or disposed of since application. All of the controls, both administrative and on-the-spot, are carried out within the retention period.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulations, penalties are applied where it is found that the number of sheep applied on are not maintained for the retention period. There is a sliding penalty scale but if the difference between the number of ewes declared or the quota held, whichever is lesser, and the number found exceeds 20% of the number found no premium is payable for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration through serious negligence are excluded from the scheme for that year. Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration intentionally are excluded from the scheme for that year and the following year. The number of producers penalised for irregularities under the 1999 and 2000 ewe premium schemes was 1,599 and 1,804 respectively. Under the sheep headage scheme, <Col N="750" /> 1,222 farmers attracted penalties in 1999 while 1,201 farmers were penalised in 2000.</P>
    <P>Given the unacceptable situation highlighted in the detailed assessment of applications in the Cooley area of County Louth, my Department is putting in place a range of additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. I will be availing of all mechanisms to tackle head-on any unacceptable practices unearthed in Cooley or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Due to the foot and mouth disease problem, it has not been possible to carry out the normal level of on-farm inspections under the scheme this year. Under arrangements agreed with the European Commission, member states affected by the FMD problem must put alternative controls in place. These involve, <i>inter alia</i>, cross checks against databases in the case of bovine schemes and, in the case of the ewe premium scheme, documentary checks which may be conducted on-the-spot or by administrative means. Payments will not issue under the 2001 ewe premium scheme in advance of satisfactory completion of all of the checking arrangements. I am satisfied that the introduction this month of individual sheep tagging will minimise the risk of fraudulent applications in the future. This is essential if the interests of the vast majority of our farmers and those of Irish and European taxpayers are to be fully assured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to generally forecast price developments with any degree of accuracy because of the considerable number of variables involved &ndash; markets, price supports, levels of export refunds etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following is the position regarding specific commodities: The market situation in the beef sector in Ireland in the second half of the year will be substantially dependent on the availability of third country markets and the market supports operated by the European Commission. Virtually all third country markets are closed at present to Irish cattle and beef and, in the months ahead, I will be using all of the diplomatic resources available to me to secure their re-opening. Egypt is of particular importance in view of the size of that market for Irish beef. Senior officials of my Department have recently visited Egypt to brief their counterparts on the range of controls that have been put in place to deal with BSE and foot and mouth disease both at EU and national level. Follow-up action is being taken by my Depart<Col N="751" /> ment in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>As far as market supports are concerned, the purchase for destruction scheme will be replaced, from 1 July, by a special purchase scheme which will not apply to steers. In this situation, the steer and beef market will be supported through intervention and export refunds. I will be seeking to have these supports operate at a level that will ensure a satisfactory return to our producers. As far as price developments in the second half of the year are concerned, beef intervention prices are due to be reduced by 6.7% from 1 July under the Agenda 2000 agreement. However, premiums have been increased substantially to compensate producers for this reduction in prices. These premiums will be worth an additional £175 million or 20p/lb. to Irish producers this year compared to 1999.</P>
    <P>Sheep prices in Ireland so far this year are on average, approximately 25% higher than in 2000 largely because of the export ban imposed on sheep and sheepmeat from the United Kingdom as a result of the foot and mouth disease situation there. In view of the very substantial number of sheep which have been slaughtered in the UK because of FMD and the likelihood that the export ban on sheep and sheepmeat from the UK is likely to remain in place until the end of this year, the prospects are for sheep prices to remain well above last year's levels for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>Dairy markets have remained stable during the first five months of this year. Going forward there may be some pressure on the market as peak output during April to September seeks outlets in third country markets and within the EU. Given these uncertainties it is not possible to predict producer prices for the latter half of the year at this stage. The outlook, however, is generally favourable and I am confident that Irish exporters will continue to maintain existing markets and seek new market opportunities for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards sugar, the COM in the sugar sector is currently under review, however, it is expected that about 1.38 million tonnes of contracted sugar beet will be produced in 2001 i.e. sufficient to manufacture the national sugar quota. The price paid for sugar beet is as specified in EU regulations for standard quality beet with specified sugar content. The price can be adjusted to take account of sugar content above or below the standard. Any additional payment is a matter for negotiation between the growers and the sugar manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The EU price forecasting group has predicted a price of £125 per 100 kgs &ndash; grade E pig carcases &ndash; for Ireland for the third quarter of 2001 and £128 for the fourth quarter. These prices represent increases of about 18% on the same period in 2000. It should be borne in mind, however, that these estimates do not take into account the effects of measures and market forces arising <Col N="752" /> from foot and mouth disease and BSE. The possible impact of these effects is as yet unknown and may result in deviation of actual prices from these estimates.</P>
    <P>In so far as it is possible to predict, poultry and egg prices are expected to remain at around current prices for the remainder of the year. The price of meat imported from third countries is of course an important influence on poultry meat prices in the EU. China will be eligible to join the list of third countries exporting to the EU in the second half of the year and the consequences for price levels remain to be seen.</P>
    <P>There is no common organisation of the market in potatoes, nor, any form of intervention mechanisms such as market withdrawals, production quotas or export support. The sector is consequently dominated by market forces which can lead to large fluctuations in producer prices from year to year, affected directly by production levels and prices prevailing elsewhere in the EU. Under these circumstances, it is impossible at this time to predict potato prices for the latter half of 2001.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate the market trends for cereals in the second half of 2001. This will depend on the harvest in this country and other EU member states. The intervention price for cereals in 2001, resulting from CAP reform negotiations under Agenda 2000, was reduced by 7.5% and the price for the 2001/2002 marketing year will be £79.79-101.31  per tonne.</P>

      <P>The REP scheme specification under which this application was lodged includes the following provision. The planner should be satisfied that the applicant has available for inspection, by an authorized person, any of the following ownership/leasing documentation: Registered land &ndash; a copy of Land Registry folio showing applicant(s) or partner(s) as owner(s) or certified copy of stamped deed of transfer where transfer has taken place and registration is not completed.</P>
      <P>An issue arose in this case with regard to reclamation work on lands purchased by the applicant that included the removal of boundary fences and the burning of uprooted trees. Where there is evidence of deliberate removal of habitats prior to application to join REPS, such applicants are rendered ineligible. The reason the documentation was sought in this case was to establish if and when the applicant was in possession of these lands and thus to make a determination on the application.</P>
      <P>My Department has an obligation as an accredited paying agency of the European Union to ensure that all applications are eligible for participation in the scheme. This will occasionally, as in this case, require the submission by the applicant of additional information.

The file is now at my Department's REPS headquarters in Wexford and a decision will be made as soon as possible on the eligibility of the application.</P>

      <P>Under the early retirement 2000 scheme &ndash; ERS2 &ndash; certain income criteria apply for both the transferor and the transferee. The transferor must derive at least 25% of his or her income from farming and the total income from farming and non-farming sources must not exceed 200 income units, except in the case of a definitive transfer to a family member where there is no upper limit. The transferee must prove his or her viability by having an income of at least 50 income units of which 20 income units are derived from farming. An upper non-farm income limit of 100 income units applies to the transferee. In cash terms, an income unit is £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of non-farm income under the scheme includes unemployment benefit as well as <Col N="755" /> a number of other social welfare payments. The primary purpose of this is to enable potential transferees who may not be in remunerative employment, or may be temporarily unemployed, to achieve the minimum level of income which determines viability. Therefore, rather than being discriminatory, this definition is intended to make the scheme more widely available by increasing the number of potential transferees.</P>

      <P>It was necessary in the context of the overall management of the foot and mouth disease situation that sheep grazing on the Curragh be moved at an early stage of the crisis. With a few exceptions, the co-operation of the flock owners was readily forthcoming. Those who had initially resisted the Department's request, made in the overall national interest of ensuring that everything possible was done to minimise the risk of the spread of foot and mouth disease, eventually took the responsible course of action.</P>
      <P>On the advice of the expert advisory group which has reviewed our foot and mouth disease controls on an ongoing basis, measures were put in place some time ago to facilitate the movement under permit of susceptible animals on welfare grounds. These arrangements, which entail a veterinary inspection, apply nationally. If any flockowner is experiencing welfare problems, it is open to him or her to make an application for the relevant permit.</P>
      <P>The point has not yet been reached where I consider it appropriate to allow normal movement of sheep to resume. I will keep this matter under review on the basis of advice from the expert group and taking account of prevailing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 155 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Under EU legislation, third countries wishing to export animal products to the EU must satisfy the European Commission that their legislative frameworks and control regimes offer equivalent guarantees to those in place in the EU. In particular, third countries must furnish to the Commission on an annual basis detailed residue monitoring plans, together with results of testing under such programmes. The Commission also carries out inspection missions in third countries to verify implementation of control measures. Where the Commission is not satisfied with the regime in place in a third country, its authorisation to export to the EU may be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>As regards imports into Ireland, it must be borne in mind, however, that in the case of imports from other member states, particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. At the points of entry into Ireland officials of my Department spot check consignments of goods being imported from other member states and from third countries to ensure compliance with the necessary legislation. Goods which are not in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and, if necessary, destroyed.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent outbreaks of diseases in the Community, I have already raised the issue of the appropriate standards for imports from third countries and their enforcement at recent meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I will continue to pursue this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland imports an extensive range of agricultural goods and food products, including beverages, from other member states and from approximately 134 third countries. This import trend and Ireland's export performance reflect the ever increasing globalisation of the food sector. In recognition of this development and the need to standardise public health safeguards with <Col N="758" /> regard to food production, the European Commission has in place a legislative framework and control regime in respect of agricultural food production.</P>
    <P>The main conditions for imports into Ireland are advance notification to my Department of consignments; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department. Imports of meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product.</P>
    <P>However, it must be borne in mind that, in the case of imports from other member states, particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and, if necessary, destroyed.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent outbreaks of diseases in the Community, I have already raised the issue of the appropriate standards for imports from third countries and their enforcement at recent meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I will continue to pursue this matter.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Durkan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>if, in the case of all imported meat and food products, he is satisfied that such products are entirely free from growth promoters or antibiotic residues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14319/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Common legislation is in place at EU level which regulates the area of growth promoters and antibiotics. Accordingly, animal products imported here from countries within the EU have been subject to the aforementioned legislation which, in broad terms, provides that while hormonal growth promoters are entirely banned, use of four specific antibiotics for growth promotion purposes is allowed. In addition, all member states are required to have approved residue surveillance plans in place to detect the presence of any banned substances or the presence above legal limits, that is, maximum residue limits, of authorised products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third countries wishing to export products to the EU are required to satisfy the European Commission that they have measures in place to provide equivalent guarantees to those provided <Col N="759" /> for under EU residues legislation. Third countries are also subjected to missions by inspectors from the Commission's food and veterinary office for the purpose of verifying implementation of their control measures.</P>
    <P>In the context of concerns about antibiotic resistance, my Department, in the latter part of 1999 and in conjunction with the FSAI, commenced a major programme of testing of poultry meat which includes testing of imported poultry meat both for the presence of antibiotics and for the incidence of antibiotic resistant camplobacter and salmonella. Of 330 samples of imported poultry meat taken in 1999 under this programme, none tested positive for antibiotic residues. Results in respect of 2000 will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>Since the foot and mouth disease crisis began in February last, my Department has been engaged in a range of investigations involving both persons and premises as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. These investigations, many of which have been undertaken in conjunction with the Garda, have encompassed traceback operations linked to suspect or illegally imported animals, follow-up inquiries to information obtained by the Department from a variety of sources or given to it in confidence and probes undertaken by the Department where it has identified concerns which have warranted further scrutiny. Many of these investigations are ongoing and may result in prosecutions being initiated. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this juncture.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, it is my intention that my Department in due course generally review the foot and mouth disease experience with a view to identifying and putting in place the measures which doubtless will be necessary in several areas where particular concerns have come to light.</P>

      <P>The fact that we have had only one case of foot and mouth disease in the State and that almost two months have elapsed since that case was confirmed give grounds for optimism that we may shortly be in a position to make the relevant declaration under OIE &ndash; Office International des Epizooties &ndash; rules to the effect that the State is once again foot and mouth disease free. However, there remains an overhang of risk from foot and mouth disease in Great Britain and a degree of uncertainty in relation to the situation in Northern Ireland. It must remain a priority to ensure that we protect ourselves against risk from these quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have arrived at the point where no further concerns remain in relation to foot and mouth disease in Britain and Northern Ireland, I intend that my Department should generally review the experience of the last few months in relation to foot and mouth disease. There is no doubt that lessons can be learned and it is also clear that action will be needed in several areas where particular concerns have come to light. Certain actions have already been taken. New <Col N="762" /> rules governing dealers have been introduced, a national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; is being introduced in coming weeks and legislation which significantly strengthens the Department's ability to effectively tackle a number of areas of particular concern has been enacted in the form of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>In many senses the foot and mouth disease crisis has been a watershed for Irish agriculture and in certain respects things can never be the same again. If we maintain the current positive trend of developments and suffer no further case of foot and mouth disease, the experience which the entire community has undergone over recent months can be turned to real advantage and can generate changes in our approach to a number of aspects of agriculture which will be of considerable benefit in the longer term.</P>

      <P>While the bovine tuberculosis eradication programme operated by my Department is extremely comprehensive, progress towards final eradication has been disappointing. It is now accepted by veterinary experts that the primary constraint on containing and eradicating bovine tuberculosis is the existence of a significant reservoir of infection among the wildlife population.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has agreed to commit specific staff resources in each district veterinary office &ndash; DVO &ndash; to carry out investigative work into the causes of breakdowns. In addition, a research programme involving disciplines in zoology, microbiology, immunology and pathology is in place. A wildlife removal project and a vaccine development project are among the scientific work being carried out. The veterinary epidemiology and tuberculosis investigation unit, based in the veterinary college, investigates the factors which militate against the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle at national or regional levels and identifies means of improving the current rate of eradication.</P>
      <P>Due to the recent foot and mouth disease situation, the annual round test of each herd in the State was postponed in line with decisions taken to allow only essential farm visits. However, consequential testing, such as reactor retests, contiguous tests, etc, were allowed to continue. The annual round test is now being relaunched and it is expected that, with the co-operation of all concerned, a full programme will be completed this year.</P>
      <P>In other member states, the bovine TB eradication programmes that are co-financed by the EU are approved each year by the standing veterinary committee and monitored by the EU Commission. These and other programmes are governed by the level of disease in the area and the requirement to comply with the relevant EU trading directives. It is worth noting that the occurrence of TB in certain areas of the UK is also associated with a wildlife reservoir of infection.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the bovine brucellosis eradication programme conducted by my Department is proving to be successful. There are a number of positive factors emerging to indicate that the incidence of the disease is declining and it is hoped that this trend will continue. However, the current level of testing and other control measures must be maintained until such time as total eradication is achieved. The monitoring for brucellosis in the national herd is conducted mainly by way of annual blood testing of all eligible animals in every herd. This is supplemented by a number of other measures to identify occurrence of the disease and to curb its spread.</P>
      <P>Due to the recent foot and mouth disease situation the annual round test of each herd in the State was postponed in line with decisions taken to allow only essential farm visits.

A brucellosis subgroup, on which Ireland is represented, was created in April 2000 to support member states in developing and implementing optimal disease eradication measures.</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the position in so far as the transfer of lands and property within families is concerned arising from changes made in the Finance Act, 2001, particularly in relation to the abolition of probate tax; if any duties are payable to the State on the transfer of small land holdings between family members; if a valuation or income threshold applies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, transfers of land and property within families are liable to stamp duty on the market value of the property. However, there is a 50% reduction on the standard stamp duty rates on transfers between specified close relatives. In addition, such transfers would be liable to CGT also based on the market value of the site.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, I introduced a relief whereby neither stamp duty nor CGT will apply on the transfer of a site from a parent to a child on or after 6 December 2000 provided it is for the construction of the child's principal private residence and the market value of the site does not exceed £200,000. It will also be a condition that a parent can only transfer one site to each child for the purposes of this exemption. If such a site is subsequently sold by the child without the principal private residence having being constructed and lived in for three years, there will be a clawback of the CGT relief allowed on the transfer from the parent to the child except in the case of the death of the child or where he or she transfers his or her interest or part of the interest in the land to his or her spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this relief is to encourage parents to transfer a site to their children during the parent's lifetime, thereby helping to increase housing supply. Where such a transfer takes place on death, it has always been the position that there is no charge to stamp duty and CGT. There is no exemption from capital acquisitions tax &ndash; CAT &ndash; on such transfers. However, the exemption threshold currently applying for gifts/ inheritances from a parent to a child is £316,800. Consequently, such transfers would in most, if not <Col N="766" /> all, cases be exempt from CAT as the market value of the site must not exceed £200,000. A charge to CAT may only arise if the child had received previous gifts from the parent since 2 December 1988. Under the CAT aggregation rules, the value of such previous benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current, if any, liability, to tax. A threshold of £31,680 applies to gifts/inheritances where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendent of the disponer.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are various reliefs applying under the CAT legislation including agricultural relief and business relief. Agricultural relief operates by allowing the value of agricultural land, buildings, livestock and machinery to be reduced by 90% for the purposes of calculating the value for CAT. This 90% relief applies to agricultural assets received both by inheritance and gift. Agricultural relief applies only where the beneficiary's agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance are 80% or more of total assets. Business relief operates by allowing the value of certain businesses or the value of shares in certain companies to be reduced by 90% subject to a minimum period of ownership by the transferor prior to the gift or inheritance in question. Gifts and inheritances of the &ldquo;family home&rdquo; taken on or after 1 December 1999 are also exempt from CAT subject to certain conditions regardless of the nature of the relationship between the disponer and the recipient.</P>
    <P>At present, there is also full stamp duty relief for qualified young trained farmers on transfers of any type of agricultural land subject to certain conditions. The aim of this relief is to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming. No other sector can avail of such a generous relief.</P>
    <P>In relation to probate tax, I abolished this tax in budget 2001 in respect of deaths occurring on or after budget day, 6 December 2000. In the case of probate tax arising on estates where the death occurred before 6 December 2000, the tax is charged at a rate of 2% on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased whether the assets passed under will or intestacy. Estates with a taxable value of £40,000 or less are exempt from the tax. A total exemption from probate tax is available where property passes to a spouse and where jointly-owned property passes automatically from one joint owner to another joint owner. In addition, the share of the family home passing to dependent children or dependent relatives of the deceased is exempt subject to certain conditions. There are other exemptions for pension benefits, charitable bequests, heritage property and the proceeds of section 60 insurance policies, which are used to pay inheritance tax/probate tax. Agricultural land and buildings may also be reduced in value by 30% for probate tax purposes. There is also provision in the legislation for deferral of the tax by the Revenue <Col N="767" /> Commissioners in cases of hardship or where the estate is illiquid.</P>

While decisions in relation to the selection of suitable locations will be influenced by many wide ranging factors such as the encouragement of economic activity, infrastructural capacity and the efficient and effective delivery of public services, I do not consider it helpful to set out an exhaustive list of such criteria.

      <P>Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate, to individuals <Col N="768" /> for rent paid for private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence. The level of rent qualifying for relief under section 473 depends on an individual's martial status and age.

      <P>Prior to this year's Finance Act, the amount of rent paid on which relief could be claimed depended on whether an individual was single, widowed or married. However, in this year's Finance Act, those individuals who are widowed will be entitled to claim tax relief on the same amount of rent paid as married individuals.

    <P>In relation to the provision of speech and language therapy services, the board and the voluntary agencies have taken a flexible and innovative approach to the development of the service with a view to ensuring effective recruitment and retention of staff. The speech and language therapy services at St. Mary's school currently provide a service 2.25 days per week. The proposed developments in the service in 2001 will increase service provision to five days.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational psychological ser<Col N="770" /> vices for schools is the responsibility in the first instance of the Department of Education and Science.

      <P>As I mentioned in my previous reply, I am aware of the situation regarding staff shortages in the grades of occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. I have taken steps to deal with the problem. These include the commissioning of the study by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, which will be published shortly, increasing the number of student places in the therapy schools and implementing the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions. As an interim measure, following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, the number of student places for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy was increased by five and eight respectively, from October 2000. The capacity of the colleges does <Col N="771" /> not allow for any further expansion in the number of places.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have implemented the recommendations of the expert group concerning the pay of therapists and career structures for the therapy grades have been significantly enhanced. They have been designed to make the therapy professions more attractive and aid the recruitment and retention of staff. On the question of the extent of the actual shortages, my Department does not have any figures and I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he is proposing a pilot project for the proposed primary care cardio-vascular scheme in view of the fact that the general opinion of general practitioners is that living in a population of fewer than four million people would in itself be a pilot project in other countries and that one third of the resources that were meant to go into primary care had not yet been achieved.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first phase of the programme of structured care in general practice is scheduled to commence this year. A total of £2 million has been set aside nationally for this purpose in 2001. The initial 12 months of the programme is being called the first phase, as opposed to a pilot programme, to indicate that it is intended to further develop the programme in the years to come following an evaluation of the first phase. However, this is a large and complex undertaking and it will be important to learn as many lessons as possible from this first phase which can then be applied as the programme is expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients to be included in the scheme as a priority in the first phase are patients who have had a myocardial infarction, a coronary artery angioplasty &ndash; medical &ndash; procedure or coronary artery bypass surgery. The evaluation of the first phase of the programme of structured care in general practice of patients with cardio-vascular disease will permit more accurate quantification of the workload involved and of the resources required to deliver the service. In addition, the process evaluation will collect the views of all those involved, especially patients, GPs and practice nurses, as to how the system can be improved before it is further expanded. Given that this is the first programme of its kind in general practice in Ireland, it would not be prudent to implement the programme at full capacity without first examining in more detail its clinical aspects, the resources required and the best structures for delivering it. The evaluation of structure and process which will be carried out as part of the first phase will permit the implementation of a more <Col N="772" /> effective and efficient service to patients as the programme is further expanded.</P>

      <P>The national GP IT group was set up in 1997. Its philosophy was to pragmatically engage with all the relevant stakeholders to progress IT and electronic communications in primary care and between GPs and hospitals. My Department is committed to developing and supporting information technology initiatives in the general practice area.</P>
      <P>A recent survey undertaken by the ICGP showed that the level of computer usage by general practitioners is low, but that there were a variety of reasons for this. The area of training of the GPs was one that was viewed as crucial. A decision to undertake a national training programme was piloted in 1999 in two health boards and extended nationwide on a pilot basis in 2000. A total of 270 GPs participated.</P>
      <P>A major problem in the use of electronic messaging between the general practitioner and the hospital is that a range of systems is being used. They are not compatible with each other and, therefore, electronic transmission of data is not possible. A consultant has been engaged to accredit the software systems available. She is consulting with GPs, health boards, hospitals and software suppliers during the course of her contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pilot electronic messaging project is under way at the Mater Hospital. Healthline links 25 general practitioners in the north Dublin area with the Mater Hospital and plans to extend it to Beaumount Hospital are well advanced. Progress is also being made in relation to its extension to <Col N="774" /> Limerick Regional Hospital. The system allows for electronic transmission of pathology and radiology results, accident and emergency admissions details, waiting list and discharge notifications. The software used is supplied by Healthlink and installed, if necessary, by it at participating practices. There is a vigorous data protection system in place in order to safeguard patient information at Healthlink.</P>
    <P>The computerisation in general practice and its links to other primary care services and to hospitals is considered crucial to the development of an integrated health service. It is one of the areas highlighted in the major review of general practice undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards which I hope to address in my consultations with the representative bodies such as the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry is responsible for collating data on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in Ireland. As part of the NCI All-Ireland cancer initiative, support was given to the cancer registries in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to collate and publish All-Ireland cancer statistics. The first report relates to 1994-96. I co-launched this report together with Ms Bairbre de Brún, Minister for Health and Social Services, Northern Ireland, on 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to oesophageal cancer, the report shows that Ireland has a higher than average EU rate for females. However, the report goes on to recommend that further investigation is needed <Col N="775" /> into the possible factors accounting for disproportionately high rates of oesophageal cancer among women in some parts of Europe including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The risk of oesophageal cancer is greatly increased by lifestyles such as tobacco smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. In this context, it is vital that our focus is both on the prevention of cancer where possible, and an early and appropriate intervention for those who develop cancer. The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include national mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
    <P>My Department is implementing the National Cancer Strategy and other strategies which have arisen from it such as the symptomatic breast disease services report, which provides for high quality services through centres of excellence for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</P>
    <P>I am committed to providing the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have cancer.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. There are waiting lists caused by staff shortages in the occupational therapy and speech and language therapy grades within the public health service. To address these shortages my Department engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a work force planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The study is expected to be published shortly. Once the study has been published, my Department will be discussing, with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, the number of additional student places required.</P>
      <P>ENT is one of the specialities identified by my Department for targeted funding under the waiting list initiative. Waiting list figures for ENT procedures, as reported to the Department by health agencies, show a reduction of 24% in the numbers waiting for the period December 1999 to December 2000. This year £34.5 million is being made available to health agencies to continue to tackle public hospital waiting lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In the budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons age 70 and over to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 upwards, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

I am informed by the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board that on average the waiting time for orthodontic assessment was previously three to six months. It recently increased because the board's consultant orthodontist is undertaking sessions to carry out the board's waiting list initiative scheme where patients are either treated in-house or contracted out to private specialists in orthodontics. This has increased the amount of time allocated to the provision of treatment. The chief executive officer of the board has recently advised me that the number of children awaiting assessment at the end of March 2001 is 606.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of maternity services at Dundalk County Hospital is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. The report of the review group on maternity services in the North-Eastern Health Board which was completed in November last recommended that consultant-led maternity <Col N="780" /> services at Monaghan and Dundalk should cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services should be established in Dundalk; and a consultant-led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan. I have been advised that the health board decided not to accept in full the recommendations in the review group's report and that it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit. This further review will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning as anticipated in the national development plan. The review group has been established and is scheduled to report by 7 September to the board.</P>
      <P>At the request of the board, I met the chairman and members of the board on 30 January 2001. I wrote to the chairman on 5 February and I expressed my firm view that the way forward for maternity services is to put in place services which comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice. I also stated that it was imperative that the board establish and finalise a clear view on what services will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services requiring to be developed and the enhancement of existing services in the light of the £160 million NDP funding which has been notified to the board.</P>
      <P>I have also been advised that at a special meeting on 5 February the board further considered the question of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk. The board mandated the chief executive officer to seek, as a matter of urgency, approval for the appointment of temporary consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath Hospital groups to facilitate the continuation of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk and to seek, in addition, approval for the immediate appointment of on-site paediatric cover at both hospitals. The approval of any such posts is a matter for An Chomhairle, which is the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 13 February the board sought the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal to the appointment of five temporary consultant staff, including one temporary consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist and a temporary consultant paediatrician for the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital group to be based at Monaghan Hospital. Comhairle na nOspidéal recently established a North-Eastern Health Board maternity services committee to review obstetric &ndash; maternity &ndash; and related paediatric, anaesthetic and gynaecological services for the population of the NEHB area, with particular reference to consultant staffing in the context of current best practice in order to facilitate high quality and safe services to women and children. This committee is considering the NEHB request for five temporary consultants and will report to the <Col N="781" /> applications committee of An Chomhairle when its work programme is completed.</P>
    <P>Pending a response from An Chomhairle to the application for the five temporary consultant posts the chief executive officer of the health board established a working group to prepare an action plan to ensure that all necessary appropriate actions were taken to provide for the safety of patients and staff having regard to the special needs and wishes of the patients concerned. Arising from this, in-patient obstetric services for Cavan-Monaghan are being provided at Cavan General Hospital. Discussions with consultant medical staff with a view to providing ante-natal and post-natal clinics at Monaghan General Hospital are ongoing. In this regard, I am advised by the board that it has a designated project office, based at the Monaghan site, who will respond to expectant mothers experiencing any difficulties with appointments etc. I am satisfied that the interim measures which have been introduced by the board, pending a response from An Chomhairle to the application for the additional temporary consultant posts, are providing an appropriate response to address the specific needs of maternity patients at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

Work on compiling the register is currently under way in the Office of Public Works. Once the register is completed it will enable the Government to determine whether there are lands or buildings in the ownership of the State, which can be used for housing, education, recreation or other functions for which the State has responsibility and to decide on the most appropriate use for such lands. Agreement has already been reached separately with the Department of Defence for prior consultations with the relevant local authorities when the sale of surplus Defence lands is being contemplated and these arrangements are working satisfactorily.</P>

Section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, provides power to make regulations, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, requiring works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have felt for some time that the original school meals scheme falls a long way short of what is required to properly address this issue. I do not consider that a simple expansion of that scheme would meet the needs of today's school going children in an efficient or effective manner. Accordingly, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the existing scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision.</P>
      <P>As part of the review, my officials engaged in a wide ranging consultation exercise. This included meeting with and visiting some of those involved in new school meals initiatives at local level, known as breakfast or lunch clubs. Many of the projects have given very positive feedback, children's punctuality and attendance levels at school have improved and teachers have noticed that their attention levels have also improved. The breakfast/lunch clubs provide a forum where children can meet and network with their friends in a calm relaxed atmosphere and then proceed to class in a more positive frame of mind.</P>
      <P>The overwhelming area of concern identified by these projects was the lack of State funding for them. I agree with the Deputy that the excellent work done by voluntary and community groups is laudable and I decided last year that an immediate response was required. Pending completion of the review I provided £100,000 interim funding under a new scheme that I introduced in 2000 &ndash; the school meals community programme. Given the success of that initiative, I have increased the funding in 2001 to £300,000. This funding is intended to meet the food costs of the voluntary and community based groups that are currently operating innovative school meals projects outside the scope of the original statutory scheme. It supports existing initiatives that are targeting areas of disadvantage or children with special needs and it is available on a nation-wide basis to both primary and secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the funding has been allocated to 62 projects and will benefit almost 5,000 children. In addition, a further seven applications are currently on hand and decisions in relation to these will be made shortly. As I have stated, these measures were taken as an interim measure to <Col N="788" /> provide immediate practical support pending the completion of the review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the longer term, it is clear that State wide coverage with full Government support, including substantial funding, is required. However, the question of how best to organise schools meals provision into the future, and specifically whether a State wide Government organised school meals service is required, has yet to be finalised. The primary consideration will be how to maximise the benefit to disadvantaged children but regard will also be had to the wider social gain that can flow from the direct involvement of local communities in school meal provision. I expect to receive the working group's report in the summer, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of social welfare credits is to secure the PRSI entitlements of insured workers, who are temporarily outside the paid workforce for reasons such as unemployment, illness etc., in a manner which is consistent with the continued viability of the social insurance fund. Where a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for more than two full contribution years, they are not allowed to claim credits until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the award of credits can give entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits, provided that a certain number of paid contributions have been made, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to have some limitations on such award. In addition, abolition of the two year limitation would have significant cost implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that a separate arrangement exists to protect the long-term social insurance pensions of people &ndash; mainly women &ndash; who give up paid employment for periods of caring. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment caring either for children aged up to 12 years or incapacitated people are disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years. An examination of the homemaker's scheme is being undertaken as part of the review of eligibility conditions for old age contributory pensions and I expect to <Col N="789" /> have a report later this year, which I will examine in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>As regards the labour market situation of women returning to the workforce, in line with a commitment in the last national programme, Partnership 2000, a working group, chaired by my Department, was set up to examine women's access to labour market opportunities. The group included representatives of the main social partners, relevant Departments, State agencies and other interested groups. The group's report was published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>On the question of the live register as a gateway to labour market programmes, the group concluded that the best approach did not lie in widening access to the live register itself but rather in the consideration of alternative direct access routes to education, training and employment programmes for the women concerned.</P>
    <P>The group also considered that different categories of women had different needs and faced access barriers particular to their individual circumstances. In view of this, the group identified three priority target groups and made specific recommendations with regard to their eligibility to participate in labour market programmes. Category one includes the qualified adults of persons who are eligible to participate in labour market programmes; category two includes spouses in low income households and category three includes returners and entrants to the labour market who have been primarily engaged in domestic and caring duties in the home.</P>
    <P>The two principal labour market schemes administered by my Department are the back to work allowance and the back to education allowance. Both of these are available to people in category one above, that is, spouses/partners of people who are eligible to participate in the programmes. The working group did not recommend the extension of the schemes to other categories. Decisions on access to VTOS and employment training schemes are matters for the Minister for Education and Science and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

Late last year I announced details of a major £100 million capital investment programme in national monuments and historic properties in State care as part of the national development plan.

The Double Tower will be conserved following the completion of the works at Reginald's Tower. These works commenced in 2000 and will continue into 2002.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 703 members, all ranks, from Garda divisions other than Border divisions have been allocated to Border duty to deal with the foot and mouth crisis. I should add that this number would have varied from time to time in the light of operational requirements and also excludes members who were assigned to investigations arising from the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>Of the 703 members referred to above, a total of 269 members have returned to normal duties and 434 have remained on Border duty to deal with the foot and mouth crisis. Again, these figures do not include Garda personnel permanently allocated to Border divisions &ndash; all of whom have a responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with the foot and mouth crisis &ndash; or members assigned to investigations arising from the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the total expenditure incurred by the Garda Síochána in policing the foot and mouth disease outbreak for the 11 week period ending 6 May 2001 is approximately £18.1 million, of which £17.9 million was paid to Garda members in respect of overtime and subsistence allowances, etc.</P>

      <P>The RIA currently has a portfolio of 74 accommodation/reception centres in the State. The nature of the contracts entered into with accommodation providers is such that small additional numbers of asylum seekers may be accommodated in individual centres on an occasional basis to cater for particular unforeseen circumstances. On the latest date for which figures are available, 7 May, a total of three persons in two centres in Tipperary and Longford were accommodated in this fashion.</P>

      <P>The report of the Victims' Commission, A Place and a Name, did not specifically recommend an independent inquiry into the Castleblayney bombing of 1976, in contrast to the Dublin/Monaghan bombings of 1974, where it recommended that a retired Supreme Court judge should be appointed to conduct privately an independent inquiry. The report did, however, recommend that procedures should be introduced to allow families to request reports on investigations of murders, arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland over the last 30 years, where no one has been made amenable. I am now finalising a detailed plan for the implementation of the report's recommendations based on consultations which have taken place with other relevant Departments and agencies, and I intend to submit this to Government very shortly for approval.</P>

Her subsequent appeal was refused by the appeals authority on 5 March 2001. In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the person in question was informed on 27 April 2001 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children. She was given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the order was made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Her reply is still awaited and I expect the file to be submitted to me for consideration shortly.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to self-employed/private providers of child care and not community based/not for profit groups. It is open to self-employed/private providers to apply for a capital grant under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006, which is operated by my Department. A sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. The funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital grants currently available under the equal opportunities child care programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care estab<Col N="794" /> lished under Partnership 2000. Under the programme, capital grants of up to £40,000 were made available in April 2000 for the first time for self-employed/private child care providers for building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of permanently based child care equipment. Budget 2000 also provided improvements to the capital allowances in relation to the costs of construction, refurbishment or extension of premises. I would like to assure the Deputy that the scheme is kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £40 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme in the form of capital and staffing grants alone to child care services on the ground. To date, over 14,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which will include the creation of almost 6000 new child care places. The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. A sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006, and is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The <Col N="795" /> overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>Schemes for capital and staffing grants for community based/not for profit group(s) who provide child care services are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006. Applications for funding under these measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. Completed applications are assessed initially, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Limited. This is followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision. As outlined in the general guidelines for funding measures, copies of which are available from my Department, applications are assessed according to the following five criteria, namely, the social economic profile of the area relating to the application, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project, the level of integration/co-ordination, and the costings/value for money of the proposal.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £40 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme in the form of capital and staffing grants alone to child care services on the ground. To date, over 14,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which will include the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda. Further details of all child care funding schemes are available from the equal opportunities child care section of my Department, lo-call 1890 20 90 30.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Garda Síochána, a Garda CCTV system is in operation in Grafton Street and the surrounding area since the year 2000 at a cost of approximately £285,000. A Garda CCTV system is planned for Dún Laoghaire. It is envisaged that the system will comprise eight cameras and will be operational by the end of 2001. The Deputy will appreciate that a detailed costing for the project is not included as this could prejudice tenders.</P>
      <P>With regard to child care, funding is currently available under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 &ndash; 2006. In the time available for answering parliamentary questions it has not been possible to compile the information in relation to child care as the list is quite extensive. The information is being compiled at present and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's request for a projection of the number of capital projects in the South Dublin area for 2001, funding under the pro<Col N="797" /> gramme is demand led and as a result it would be quite difficult to estimate the number of future applications for 2001. I understand that much work is being done to facilitate groups with the development of strategic child care plans for their areas.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that since Friday, 2 March 2001, Garda investigations into the illegal importation of animals into the Republic of Ireland have been co-ordinated by a detective chief superintendent in charge of the Garda national bureau of criminal investigations. Incident rooms were set up at a number of locations around the country and a Garda liaison office was set up in the Ballymacscanlon Hotel to liaise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>As a result of this investigation, a number of persons suspected of involvement in the illegal importation of animals into the country were identified and are currently the subject of investigation. I understand that six arrests have been made and one person has been charged. Also, a number of files are currently being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. This aspect of the investigation involves approximately 900 sheep. Substantive figures concerning other aspects of the sheep trade may be available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the statistics sought by the Deputy are not readily available and could only be obtained with the expenditure of an inordinate amount of Garda time and resources. The Garda authorities have, however, informed me that during the years 1999-2000 a small number of persons were charged with a variety of offences relating to illegal importation of animals into the country and have been convicted in the courts.</P>

      <P>A request for tender for the provision of a fully managed facility &ndash; that is, site, buildings, full management and catering facilities &ndash; to accommodate up to 400 asylum seekers, including infants and children, on the tenderer's own site and within a ten mile radius of Dublin Airport was published in the national print media in November 2000. Arising from that competition, a number of companies have submitted proposals and, following detailed evaluation of these, the Office of Public Works together with the reception and integration agency of my Department are currently finalising arrangements for the placing of a contract to the successful tenderer.</P>
      <P>The facility in question, as well as being a low rise accommodation centre modelled on similar facilities used extensively throughout Europe, will also contain full medical, welfare and recreation facilities on site. In line with Government policy on this matter, a number of other such facilities are planned on sites adjacent to major cities and towns throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Following the Labour Court recommendations and subsequent clarification, I became aware, through correspondence from and direct contact with individual teachers, that many teachers were not fully aware of the Labour Court's proposals and other recent developments. In particular, teachers seemed to be getting erroneous and misleading information on such issues as the operation of the public service benchmarking body and the benefits available to teachers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In these circumstances I considered it necessary to issue a factual leaflet to teachers on these issues. Senior Department officials and I prepared the leaflet, the full text of which is as follows:</P>
      <P>The total cost of printing and design of the leaflet was £2,850.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <b>Appendix 1. Charting the Future of Education in Ireland</b>
      </P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <b>Programme for Prosperity and Fairness: benefits for teachers</b>
      </P>
      <P Just="Center">The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in common with the national programmes which went before it, provides a coherent and sustainable approach to improving the economy and living standards while addressing wider social issues on an agreed basis of consensus.</P>
      <P Just="Center">What will teachers get under the PPF?</P>
      <P Just="Center">A cumulative total of some 22% including: 3% &ldquo;Early Settlers&rdquo; from 1 October 2000; 5.5% from 1 October 2000; further 2% from 1 April 2001; 5.5% from 1 October 2001; a once-off lump sum of 1% of basic pay on 1 April 2002; 4% from 1 October 2002.</P>
      <P Just="Center">The pay of teachers will be further increased by tax concessions of up to 10% over the period of the PPF. With effect from December 1 next, all teachers will benefit by 25% of an increase from the public service benchmarking body</P>

        <b>Teaching Council</b>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">The Teaching Council, which will include a majority of teachers (22) in its membership, will provide teachers with a high degree of pro<Col N="812" /> fessional autonomy and self-regulation. The council will enhance the professional status of teaching and the quality of Irish education. It will also give teachers an important input into policy development.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Teaching Council will: set the appropriate education, training and qualifications required for the purposes of registration as a teacher; promote the continuing education and training of teachers and review and accredit programmes of in-service training; promote teaching as a profession; establish, publish and maintain codes of professional conduct; regulate the registration, induction and probation of teachers; advise on standards of entry and teacher supply; address disciplinary problems within the profession.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>The Labour Court Recommendation</b>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">The Labour Court concluded that:teachers have a <b>sustainable case</b> in relation to their claim that they have fallen behind other professionals in recent years and the court upholds part (iii) of their claim; the benchmarking process being used by other teacher and public service unions to measure the value of jobs and responsibilities can deal with the ASTI case that they have fallen behind other professionals; the issues in relation to parts (i) and (ii) of the ASTI claim have been addressed in national agreements by pay increases, tax concessions and by a number of special awards to teachers over the years; the court considered that the ASTI arguments in relation to their contribution to the success of the economy can be made by many other groups also.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Labour Court recommended that: ASTI process their claim through the benchmarking process, noting, in particular, that: the benchmarking body will not be recommending on the introduction of performance related pay; it is a totally independent body presided over by a High Court Judge; it has a substantial budget and secretariat and independent research element and will be able to evaluate each case on its merits and on the basis of its research findings; 25% of any increase arising from benchmarking will now be paid with effect from 1 December 2001; the claim for an up-front payment should not be accepted as ASTI members have benefited from the PPF and &ldquo;Early Settlers&rdquo; increases amounting to 10.5% to date and increasing to almost 22% by 1 October 2002; the court's view is that these payments can be viewed as up-front payments; an expert review of education be undertaken involving all the partners in education and covering a wide range of areas including legal and management structures, developments in education, role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation and support systems in schools and the terms of reference to be agreed between the partners and the review body to be in place by 1 June 2001; as a gesture of goodwill, pay should not be deducted for the five &ldquo;days of action&rdquo;, that is, the days during which teachers withdrew from <Col N="813" /> supervision and substitution, on acceptance of the court recommendation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Following further discussions, the Labour Court clarified various aspects of its recommendation: <i>Benchmarking</i>: The Government has confirmed that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;payment of one quarter of any increases recommended by the benchmarking body, due to be paid with effect from 1 December, 2001, will be made immediately on receipt of the body's report which is due in June 2002;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;negotiations on the balance will begin immediately the report is available with a view to agreeing the phasing of the further payments and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;issues in relation to past productivity could be addressed as part of the benchmarking process.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Review Body</i>: The court recommends that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the body should report within six months of its establishment in June 2001 and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;as an immediate step, in recognition of the contribution which information technology can make to education, annual payments of up to £350 should be made to individual teachers towards the cost of vouched personal computer hardware and/or software relevant to their teaching responsibilities.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Supervision and Substitution:</i>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>
      </i>&ndash;The parties propose to commence discussions immediately within the framework of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme in order to have these matters resolved this summer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Completion of this year's school programme: The court recommends that:</i>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>
      </i>&ndash;appropriate arrangements be made to ensure that the current year's school programmes are completed for all students so that students affected by the dispute are not put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other students and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;teachers who are certified by the school as having contributed to the completion of the school programme be paid a sum of £1,750, with appropriate <i>pro rata</i> payments for part-time teachers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>Proposed Education Review Body</b>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">In line with the recent Labour Court recommendation, the Government proposes to establish a high level expert education review body to carry out a wide ranging review of both primary and post-primary education, examining issues of relevance to the provision of education in Ireland today.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="814" /> The Review Body will consider issues such as: the legal framework and management structures within which schools must operate; the support services available to schools and teachers; the role of the teacher, both in school and in a wider community context; the implications of developments in education and teaching for the professional development and ongoing training needs of teachers; issues surrounding the training and accreditation of teachers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Proposals in relation to the terms of reference and membership of the review body or commission are currently being developed by the Department of Education and Science with a view to circulating and agreeing them with the relevant partners in education. It is envisaged that the review body will be established by June.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Minister will be consulting in relation to its composition over the coming weeks. The commission will chart the future course of education in Ireland for the next generation.</P>

      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>

      <P>The task force which I established in October 2000 to examine provision for children with dyslexia has now completed its deliberations and I look forward to receiving a report from it in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, I announced a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. A total of 31 schools around the country are participating in the pilot project which is costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia is being provided with a laptop computer for school and home use. A grant of £2,700 per student is being paid for the purchase of laptops and software for those second year students identified as eligible for the project. Each school has received £3,000 in grant aid to purchase back-up equipment for the project teachers. Dedicated teacher training is also being provided and the national centre for technology in education, NCTE, is co-ordinating the project. The project will explore innovative ways of using information and communications technology, ICT, to assist students' learning. Assistive technology can help students to work more independently within mainstream classes or in small groups and allow for flexibility in time and place of learning.</P>
      <P>In addition to this targeted pilot project, my Department also operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties, including severe dyslexia. The purpose of the scheme is to provide these pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them, including computer equipment and software. It is open to all second level schools to submit an application under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has provided annual funding of £50,000 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, formerly know as ACLD, since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, this funding has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some chil<Col N="818" /> dren from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.</P>
    <P>As regards additional teaching resources, remedial teaching posts are allocated to each second level school to help meet the needs of pupils who require learning support. Additional teaching hours are also allocated in respect of pupils with assessed special educational needs on the recommendation of the psychological service.</P>

      <P>I recently announced the provision of a new second level school on a green field site in Ratoath, County Meath. The school will be a community college under the aegis of County Meath VEC. A number of steps now need to be taken to progress the development of the facility, including the determination of school size and catchment area and the identification and acquisition of a site. In this regard, the planning and building unit of my Department will be in contact with County Meath VEC to authorise the committee to commence the search for a site. A meeting with the committee's chief executive officer has also been arranged.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the planning and building unit of my Department received an application from the school referred to by the Deputy for the con<Col N="819" /> version of an existing handball court to a handball court /GP area.</P>
      <P>The school initially had planned to convert a handball alley on the school site. However, this was deemed to be impracticable from an architectural perspective. At that time, my Department suggested that the provision of an independent GP facility might be a more appropriate solution to the school's accommodation difficulties. However, the criteria outlined in existing planning guidelines state clearly that, in order to qualify for an independent GP facility of 111 M2, the school should retain sufficient pupil numbers to maintain a three classroom school in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Following an in-depth examination of the case, which involved consultations with the local inspector, it has been concluded that the school concerned will fulfil the required criteria for a separate GP facility. My Department will be in contact with the school authorities in the matter as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I am aware of the results of an audit of all second level schools, conducted on behalf of my Department by the National Centre for Guidance in Education. It is clear from the audit that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them by my Department for guidance and that, in many schools, the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of education early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils which would reflect both Government priorities and their pupils' needs.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to meeting the national anti-poverty strategy aims of reducing the incidence of early school leaving. Major preventative strategies and programmes have been introduced, comprising both special targeted initiatives and legislative measures, to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving and to promote and facilitate the retention of young people in education to completion of upper second level.</P>
      <P>The school completion programme incorporates a comprehensive package of measures to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. These include: the 8-15 year old early school leaver initiative introduced in 1998; the stay in school retention initiative at second level which was launched in June 1999 &ndash; projects and schools involved in the initiatives are required to operate on a multi-agency basis establishing, where appropriate, cross community links; the expansion of the home-school community liaison scheme to all schools designated as disadvantaged; the expansion of the national educational psychological service set up in 1999 on a phased basis with a view to providing a comprehensive service for all first and second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other programmes in place which support the direct initiatives aimed at reducing early school leaving. These include the early start pilot project, the support teacher pilot project and the breaking the cycle project in primary schools. I also announced in January of this year, the new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children an Even Break&rdquo;, to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, which provides a range of early <Col N="821" /> intervention and preventative measures to support participation in school by young people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service and the establishment of a national educational welfare board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>
    <P>Each of the interventions outlined is, or will be, monitored by my Department's inspectorate to ensure that they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils being targeted and, where modifications in programme content or mode of delivery are required, the necessary changes are made to incorporate these.</P>

      <P>Children on the autistic spectrum have access to a range of models of educational provision. In many cases, such children attend special dedicated classes attached to special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. A total of approximately 80 such classes have been established to date. All these classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of two special needs assistants. Children attending these facilities also attract special rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>Children on the autistic spectrum may also attend ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis, where they can be supported by the resource teacher and special needs assistants services. Apart from the range of school based models referred to above, some children on the autistic spectrum are availing of a variety of other models of response. In addition to the CABAS project to which the Deputy refers, a number of children are attending the ICANDO facility which uses an applied behavioural analysis model of response. There are also a number of cases where children are receiving a home tuition service based on the applied behavioural analysis approach.</P>
      <P>I have established a special task force on autism. The remit of the task force is to review the adequacy of the current range of educational responses to children on the autistic spectrum, including responses based on the applied behavioural analysis approach, and to make recommendations on the future development of services in this area. I expect to receive the report of the task force shortly.</P>

      <Col N="823" /> The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has engaged the UK based National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out an independent evaluation of all current State funded models of response to children with autism.

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children an Even Break&rdquo;, to tackle educational disadvantage which was launched by me in January of this year.</P>
      <P>The new programme has both an urban and rural dimension. Under the urban dimension, I am committed to supporting selected schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class, over the three year period. Based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in a school as identified in the independent survey conducted by the Educational Research Centre last year, schools were considered for additional teaching staff under the urban dimension of the programme. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of schools supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period.</P>
      <P>The retention of the additional teacher posts under the new programme is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three year period of the programme and the implementation of the maximum class sizes within the schools concerned. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the programme in respect of the current school year are also determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September in the previous school year.</P>
      <P>Some schools which were also included in the new programme were due to have teaching posts allocated under that programme withdrawn at the end of the current school year owing to falling enrolments. In view of the special nature of the scheme, I have authorised the retention of existing levels of staffing up until the 2002/2003 school year pending experience of the enrolments in September 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006 aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities in third level education. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and to improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries, whilst improving their long-term employability.</P>
      <P>Last September I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have recently received the report of the action group and I am at present considering its recommendations.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced last September the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The action group's report contains recommendations on the eligibility criteria governing the category of students who should qualify for the special rate of grant and on the appropriate rates to be paid. My Department is finalising the administrative arrangements necessary to ensure that the special rates of maintenance grant will be made available as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The special rates of maintenance grant will be applied to qualifying grant holders with effect from the 2000-2001 academic year.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The individual third level colleges operate special admission arrangements for mature students, disadvantaged students and students with disabilities, outside of the general admissions procedure through the Central Applications Office. Many of the colleges reserve a number of places each year for students coming from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>In the area of educational disadvantage, there is a range of initiatives spanning the first and second level systems and the transition from second to third level as well as at third level itself. As the Deputy will appreciate, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>Most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring. There are two aspects to these programmes. One involves assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins my approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups &ndash; students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Last September I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have recently received the report of the action group and I am considering its recommendations.</P>

      <P>Every year, my Department receives for examination more than 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products. It is not logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates and, in the interests of fairness and equity, I could not return metalwork projects and retain material from art, engineering and other examinations. The examination material is removed from the Department each year for confidential disposal.</P>
      <P>The optimum solution to the issues raised by the Deputy lies in realigning the assessment arrangements in subjects such as metalwork which generate artefacts. At present, the practical pieces in a number of subjects are examined in individual schools and consequently there are no logistical difficulties involved in returning the material. There are, however, short-term storage issues for the schools which make it difficult to expand the number of subjects where the schools retain the material to include subjects like metalwork.</P>
