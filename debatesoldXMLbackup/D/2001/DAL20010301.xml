      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Penrose, Joe Higgins, Naughten and Sargent. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the implications for Irish agriculture and the economy generally of the reported confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in south Armagh, the first case on this island since 1941; the need for the Government to outline, in detail, the steps it intends to take to deal with this potentially disastrous situation and in particular the steps it now proposes to take to determine whether the disease has spread to locations within this jurisdiction; and what additional legislative or administrative measures it intends to take to protect Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of this matter and the worrying developments overnight since I submitted my request, I hope the House will agree to this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of critical importance, namely, the state of readiness of all relevant agencies to meet the looming catastrophe of a serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease especially in view of the apparent conflict between Government assertions and the actual situation on the ground and the implications of an outbreak on the economic situation, the farming community, the rural community and all those whose jobs depend on or are related to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter <Col N="1210" /> of urgent national importance, namely, following the probable outbreak of foot and mouth disease in south Armagh and the transportation of sheep from this farm to Athleague, County Roscommon, the measures being taken in Roscommon and east Galway to restrict the movement of people and animals; the measures being taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to trace the 22 sheep which form part of the consignment from the UK and which remain unaccounted for by Department officials and why the Department only yesterday formed an exclusion zone in the Republic adjoining the farm in south Armagh when it was aware for a week of a suspected case of foot and mouth disease on that farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the evidence that foot and mouth disease is likely to be present on the island of Ireland and could even be present south of the Border; to ensure emergency measures are put in place to restrict further movement of people and animals; and that the Government answer the criticism that its response to date has been too little too late.</P>

      <P>I consider the matter to be one contemplated by Standing Order 31 and accordingly to be in order. I propose to take Deputy Penrose's motion as it was received first in my office. I now ask Deputies who support his request to rise in their places.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the urgency and importance of this matter, the Government is prepared to take the motion after the Order of Business. As that time slot had been allocated to Private Members' Time, it is a matter for the Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very urgent matter and a time slot of 3.30 p.m. this afternoon is probably too late. I would like the Whips to discuss the possibility of taking the motion following the Order of Business and to continue the debate following Question Time, if necessary. We may also need additional time this evening and I will not, therefore, be agreeing to the Dáil adjourning at the usual time today. Many Members wish to participate in this debate. It is a matter of grave concern. I will also raise this matter during leader's questions because there are matters which require immediate answer.</P>

      <P>I have one final comment. There is a yawning gap between the theory and the regulatory regime announced. This morning, a farmer within the exclusion zone south of the Border said, on a well known radio programme, that he has not yet had a visit from anyone from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for exercising your judgment in this respect. Its unanimous endorsement is a vindication of your judgment.</P>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for making time immediately available but for that to be effective we need the Taoiseach to be here. This is a crisis. Your spontaneous response to it is a vindication of that crisis. The Taoiseach should not be out of the country but should be here for part of that debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for exercising your rights under this Standing Order. Can the issue be fully dealt with today? I agree with Deputy Quinn that the Taoiseach should be present given that perhaps next week the Dáil may not be able to meet. In the event, where possible, of people not travelling from various parts of Ireland, the example may have to be set by this Parliament. We will have to extend today's business to the greatest extent possible with that possibility in mind.</P>

        <b>:</b> There should perhaps be a period of about one hour for the Government to prepare a statement to begin proceedings as opposed to a Minister standing up and making off-the-cuff remarks, which we subsequently learn are not in accordance with what is happening.

      <P>Standing Order 31 is a motion to adjourn and it must be taken as the last item of business. The Whips should meet to discuss an alternative format. There is no point in continuing a discussion as we are merely using time. A separate, alternative format must be decided upon.</P>

Wearing her hat as Minister in charge of the consumer interests, if all movement of animals is cancelled what provisions are being made in the interests of the consumer to ensure an adequate supply of meat is available for purchase in the coming weeks? I put it to her there is widespread public concern that the regulations and the announcements being made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Minister of State are not being implemented in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I specifically state that a farm in the exclusion zone south of the Border has not yet been visited by officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or any veterinary personnel to explain the obligations of the restriction to that particular farmer? I put it to the Tánaiste that the major radio programmes this morning have been inundated with 'phone calls from persons who have stated they have <Col N="1216" /> come through the ports and Dublin Airport where there is no visible evidence of any restriction and many of them are travelling to farms in rural Ireland. When we take into account that there is now a possible outbreak in Armagh and that there are 299 Border crossings, only 29 of which are manned by the Garda, Army or Department personnel, this would suggest that instead of having a ring of steel on the Border we have a sieve or a strainer which has no possibility of inhibiting the spread of the disease.</P>

      <P>In view of the large gap between what the House has been assured is happening and the practice on the ground, will the Tánaiste indicate whether the Government will rethink its response and convene a Cabinet task force comprised of the Ministers directly responsible in addition to the officials to address this crisis?</P>

      <P>I appreciate what has been said by the Opposition. The country faces an external threat and it behoves us all to act in a spirit of co-operation rather than confrontation. The Taoiseach has curtailed his visit to Wales. Last night he met with the British Prime Minister and one of the issues discussed was our common interest in foot and mouth disease. A committee is in place. This morning the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I met with the chief veterinary officer and others. That committee met at 8 a.m. The Minister and I have been assured that all Border crossings are sealed and are patrolled&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told they are. This is what I was told before I came to the Order of Business. There are 450 gardaí involved, 200 Army personnel and an extra 13 patrols have been placed overnight in the new exclusion zone. That order was signed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development last night so that it would not have been possible, since 10 p.m. yesterday, to visit every farm in the area. What is important is that there is no movement of animals in the entire area. In relation to the employment aspects, if there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here it will have a catastrophic effect on employment and the economy generally. Given that this is a £9 million industry it will have serious implications for the entire economy and not only those who work in this industry. I have had a number of discussions with officials and agencies of my Department in relation to certain matters.  The approach to be adopted will be the precautionary approach. We have not made any arrangements for meat to be supplied in the event of foot and mouth disease being detected here. That is a useful suggestion which I will certainly consider.</P>

We are not inventing this. The Tánaiste's officials are also listening to this information. We want to help the Government on this issue but it must provide leadership. Does the Tánaiste realise that the level of information coming from the Department and Government agencies is woefully behind that provided by their British counterparts. I heard on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; this morning that the website put up by the UK Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, on how to respond to this crisis is infinitely more substantial in relation to detail. Given that we have a modern communications system in this country, will the Tánaiste ensure, in addition to the mobilisation of State agencies, many of which are under her direct control, that everyone plays their part? However, in order to do so, they must be aware of what part to play and how to play it, and that is a communications exercise. While the Tánaiste may be assured by what she is being told, the reality on the ground is quite different. We must match reality with fact, therefore, we need the communications system to be under the control of the Tánaiste and the Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste accept that in responding to this crisis, the responsibility does not fall exclusively on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or, indeed, the Minister of State? The Ministers for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Public Enterprise, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence have a role to play, together with any other Department which has the resources or ability to ensure movement of people, which could add to the contagion, is reduced if not stopped. This should not be exclusively the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, although he is clearly in the front line. That is why the Labour Party is calling for a Government-led task force of Cabinet Ministers to ensure maximum inter-departmental co-operation between the various Departments. The Tánaiste knows that this will not be the case if officials are merely talking to other officials. The authority of Cabinet Ministers is required from a Cabinet sub-committee.</P>

The original proposals for statements on Iraq allocated ten minutes per spokesperson. That is totally unsatisfactory. The proposal to schedule the debate on human rights for next Thursday afternoon is equally unacceptable. After examining previous proposed work schedules it is clear that foreign affairs and human rights have been dumped into the second half of Thursday afternoon, which is unacceptable. As soon as the Minister for Foreign Affairs returns there should be a comprehensive debate on Iraq and it and the issue of human rights, on the Order Paper since 1997, should be properly accommodated for appropriate debate by the House.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Nice was signed in France on 26 February and the text is now available. The Government has given signals but no clear commitment that a referendum will be held. Will the Tánaiste indicate if a formal decision has been made? When will the legislation necessary to provide for the referendum be published and when will the referendum be held? When will the Government publish a definitive statement on the treaty to allow for the debate that must be conducted within the framework of the law, bearing in mind that the maximum participation by all citizens is required and necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>1.&ndash;The Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 56:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>56A.&ndash;In making an order pursuant to section 57 (as amended by the <i>Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Act, 2001</i>) the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of making provision in such order for persons who have for a substantial period been customers of a bank which is the <Col N="1234" /> subject of an order to receive a recognition of their loyalty to that bank.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the Government should consider the possibility of giving a loyalty bonus, in effect, to long-term customers of the TSB in disposing of its interest in the TSB. The amendment is phrased in this way because I am advised that any more specific provision would be a charge on the Exchequer and would not be admissible. The intention of the amendment is, I hope, fairly clear.</P>
    <P>The background is that what is now known as the TSB has been, in one form or other, in existence for about 200 years. It was originally set up by groups of people coming together and, effectively, providing a facility which would allow them to save. It has gone through a number of different mutations over a period of 200 years, since the start of the 19th century. The background is important because it is undeniable that customers of the TSB have a greater sense of loyalty and belonging to the TSB than customers of AIB or Bank of Ireland, for example. I have been contacted by a number of people, particularly from the Munster region, in the Limerick and Cork areas, who feel their loyalty should be in some way reflected in the manner of the disposal of the bank.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said he strongly believes &ndash; I have no reason to doubt this &ndash; that there is no legal obligation on Government to make a gesture of this kind. That, in a sense, misses the point. What I am talking about is, in effect, an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which would acknowledge that people have deliberately chosen to save and place their money in the TSB and to support what they regard as a community-based bank going back, in many cases, over some decades.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, there is a provision to set up an ESOT as part of the rather complicated process of disposing or selling of the TSB to Irish Life. We have acknowledged in this House &ndash; the precedent is now well established &ndash; that the workforce is entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale. It seems it is only one further step from that to acknowledge that customers of a particular State enterprise are also entitled to, in some way, share in the proceeds of the sale. I understand that both the banks involved, the TSB and Irish Life, acknowledge that it is entirely a matter for the Minister to decide, that is, how he disposes of the proceeds of sale and, therefore, the matter falls to be decided by him.</P>
    <P>I apologise that I missed Committee Stage. Unfortunately, I was not there to participate in the discussion at that stage. The Minister will recall that the Order of Business on that day went on for about an hour and a half longer than it normally does and Committee Stage was postponed on at least two occasions, as a result of which I unfortunately missed it. I record my apology in that regard.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that a precedent has <Col N="1235" /> been set with, for example, mutual societies when demutualised and that their members have shared in the proceeds of sale. Again, we are not talking about anything more than a gesture. The amount of money concerned, in most cases, was not huge and amounted to a few hundred pounds. The precedent is established and many TSB customers looking at what happened in Irish Permanent and what is now First Active will feel that they too are entitled to share in a similar way. I appreciate, of course, that there is a different legal structure but, nonetheless, we cannot expect that most customers of TSB will be as sensitive as perhaps people in this House might be to the legal niceties of the matter. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will give some consideration to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I support the proposal made by Deputy McDowell. I hope the Minister will take on board at least the substance or thrust of the suggestion made by Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment which I did not support on Committee Stage seeks to require me to consider the desirability of giving some of the proceeds from the sale of the TSB to its customers, who have been loyal to the bank for a substantial period, in recognition of their loyalty. As I said on Second and Committee Stages, there are two issues here, a legal issue, that is, who owns TSB, and a second issue, irrespective of the legal entitlements, whether the customers receive a payment as a reward for being customers.</P>
      <P>The legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to the ownership issue is that Trustee Savings Banks do not have members, that they are not owned by their depositors and that the relationship between the TSB and its customers is the same as the relationship between any bank and its customers. The conclusion of this advice was that the Oireachtas had the power to dispose of the assets and this is the position under the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>The customers of other State companies are not shareholders either and such public assets are held by the State on behalf of all the citizens of the country. It is not open to me to arbitrarily allocate generally publicly owned assets to a small group of citizens. The only way I can discharge my overall duty is to take the proceeds of the disposal into general public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pointed out on Second and Committee Stages that there are fundamental differences between TSBs and building societies. Customers opening a share account in a building society are told that they become an owner of the society with the right to vote at annual general meetings. It is the customers of a building society who run the society, elect the board of directors, decide to wind up the business or decide to demutualise. In the case of the TSB, the customers have no <Col N="1236" /> ownership stake. There are no annual general meetings of depositors, the customers do not elect the trustees and have no role in the running of the bank or in deciding to sell. It is the trustees who have taken the decision to request a reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Customers opening accounts in the TSB do so in accordance with the rules of the TSB, which clearly state that they have the right to their deposit and the interest thereon. They are not given any indication or impression that their accounts confer ownership interest on them.</P>
    <P>The question of whether TSB customers should receive some payment from the sale proceeds was raised. The argument made in favour is that the loyalty of long-standing customers built up the bank and gave it a unique status. I indicated on previous Stages that until 1989 the TSB had kept at least 18% of its customers' funds on deposit with the Exchequer which paid both the interest on customer accounts and an additional margin of 1.65% to TSB branches to cover their administration costs. Under those arrangements customers effectively benefited from State support on their deposits by receiving an attractive rate of interest. Since 1989 the TSB was allowed to operate on the same terms as any other bank until it was exempted from corporation tax in 1992 in recognition of the fact that its reserves effectively belonged to the public. In 1993 the TSB started to pay corporation tax at a reduced rate and has payed the full rate since 1996. Much of the value built up in the bank during the years resulted from the bank's special relationship with the State.</P>
    <P>In arriving at a conclusion I must take precedent into account. In the case of Irish Life, Telecom Éireann and ICC Bank no free shares were provided for customers. The proceeds which I and my predecessors received were paid into the Exchequer. I am bound by these precedents. I am, therefore, unable to accept the proposed amendment. TSB customers do not have an ownership stake in the bank, as is the case with all State companies. I must discharge my responsibilities to all citizens by taking the proceeds into State funds.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, I am aware of TSB customers' feelings, particularly those from the Munster region, specifically Cork, on this matter. Many Munster people are of the view that the bank is a Cork bank as it was originally established there. While I appreciate the depth of feeling about this matter, I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons outlined. I am not willing to create a precedent in regard to the bank. The bank is not the same as a mutual or building society and, if I were to set a precedent, it would be difficult to decide on the customers who should receive free shares. Should it be the customers who started out with the bank in 1965? Should it be those who were customers in 1995? How long should people be customers of the bank to qualify for free shares? Should one differentiate between big and small customers? The <Col N="1237" /> most equitable way to proceed is to take the sale proceeds into State ownership.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act is unusual &ndash; I do not use the word &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; in any derogatory sense &ndash; in regard to the TSB's structure. This proposal was made by the trustees and although I have the power of veto in the bank's reorganisation, I cannot compel the trustees to take a particular course of action. The trustees have concluded that this is the best way for the bank to proceed. I concur, having had my own analysis undertaken. My advisers agree that this is the best deal which could possibly be done. I am not in a position to accept Deputy McDowell's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that legal process appears to have been followed to the letter in this matter and that the Minister acted on foot of the trustees' proposal, but that is not the point. The point is what will happen to the proceeds of the sale. There is no dispute about the fact that the Minister has 100% discretion in this area. I might take a different view if the Exchequer were in a different position, but it is clear that it does not need these funds at this time and can afford to make the sort of gesture I am seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; on this and previous occasions when speaking about this issue. I am not convinced that there would be anything arbitrary about giving a particular reward, bonus or acknowledgement to customers. Without its customers the bank would not exist. <Col N="1238" /> There would not be anything arbitrary about deciding that the bank's customers and staff should be entitled to some sort of benefit from the proceeds of the sale.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he would be setting a precedent in regard to other State companies, but how many other State companies does he intend to privatise? It would not necessarily have set a bad precedent to allocate a certain number of free shares to Telecom Éireann customers. That could have alleviated some of the political heat which I suspect still surrounds the issue and which may become more evident to the Government in the coming six months from frustrated Eircom shareholders. The Minister speaks about setting a precedent as if that would be a terrible thing. Such a gesture would certainly be appreciated by TSB customers.</P>
    <P>It would not prove too difficult to decide who should qualify for free shares. If loyalty is to be rewarded, someone who opened an account in the past year should not be included. It would be necessary to draw the line somewhere and it would not be difficult to do this if there was the necessary political will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for agreeing to take this important matter which permeates through the economy. This signifies the importance attached to the debate.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party acknowledges and appreciates the difficulties the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Department officials face. We wish to support the Government in its efforts to ensure the disease does not reach this jurisdiction. We do so in the national interest, as outlined on previous occasions. We wish to support the Government which must show leadership which it has been slow to do to date. We are disappointed at the level of leadership shown.</P>
      <P>The Government's actions have been characterised by statements such as &ldquo;there is no crisis, yet&rdquo;. When we reach that point, it will too late. There was no political pointscoring in my contribution and that of my colleague, Deputy Upton, on this important matter in the past week. We indicated on Tuesday, prior to the confirmation which emanated from Bríd Rogers's office yesterday, that it represents a national emergency. We sought to have put in place a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach to ensure a co-ordinated strategic response from the various Departments involved. An effort of sorts has been to do this, but we are still not satisfied that it encompasses all the relevant Departments involved. If we do not get it right at the top, it will be extremely difficult for people throughout the country to react in the positive way the nation needs them to act. That is the reason we wanted the Taoiseach to chair a sub-committee comprising the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Public Enterprise, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Foreign Affairs and sought to make its response the focal point of our defence strategy to ensure this dreaded scourge of food and mouth disease does not reach this jurisdiction. As the Minister acknowledged, we were eager that the matter be tackled on an all-island basis. Such a mechanism would ensure difficulties regarding the transportation and interchanging of animals throughout the country would be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confirmation last night by the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Ms Bríd Rodgers, that she believed sheep in south Armagh had been infected by foot and mouth disease has sent shock waves reverberating around the island. It is extremely worrying because almost all the consignment of sheep sourced at the Carlisle market that entered the island were transferred to this State. People at the centre of the movement of <Col N="1242" /> these sheep have serious questions to answer. That one of the people the authorities wish to question has effectively gone missing is an indication of the seriousness of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the IFA President Tom Parlon who said today that the full rigours of the law should be used to root out any dealer, farmer or factory owner who failed to comply with the regulations on the movement of farm animals.</P>
      <P>The issue concerning us now is how to put in place provisions that will ensure any case of foot and mouth disease is contained and eliminated. A single case of foot and mouth disease in this State would have potentially devastating effects on the economy generally and for rural society in particular. This is why we must all act responsibly and play whatever role is necessary to prevent the spread of this terrible virus if a case is confirmed on the island.</P>
      <P>It is worth illustrating the importance of the agri-industry to Ireland. Most Members of the House are acutely aware of its importance. Last week, because of the measures that were put in place, workers in some bacon factories were put on a three day week. Others were about to be notified that they would be put on a three day week next week. This has had a huge impact in the midlands and I am sure that is echoed throughout the country. Approximately 45,000 members of SIPTU are directly involved in the food and allied industries. There are 200,000 jobs in the agri-food sector in general. The recent household survey indicated that 123,000 people were employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, while others are employed in ancillary industries in the agri-food sector, such as transport and haulage.</P>
      <P>The food industry is still the cornerstone of the economy and is worth approximately £6 billion. Anything that impacts on that has an effect on every other area. If ever an issue welded together the interests of rural and urban Ireland, this is it because it will have an impact on all strands of society. If it has an impact in rural Ireland, it will have a major knock-on effect in urban Ireland. Therefore, a united stand in relation to this important industry is required. Workers in factories, transport and haulage and exporters are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I illustrated previously, the industry is disproportionately important in Ireland in comparison to Britain in terms of our dependency on it and the ratio between livestock head per head of population. There are 8 million sheep and 8 million cattle in Ireland for a population of between 3.5 million and 4 million people. In Britain, there are 12 million cattle for a population of between 55 million and 56 million people. This demonstrates the importance of the industry in Ireland. As the Minister said, it is more than three times more important to our economy compared to any <Col N="1243" /> other EU member state. This is why we must fight to protect the industry and ensure nothing impacts on it. The biggest companies in Ireland, including the Kerry Group, Dairygold, AIBP, Glanbia and Kepak, are all major employers and, as I stated, there are more than 200,000 workers in the agri-food industry.</P>
    <P>Nobody, with the possible exception of veterinary surgeons, has had any experience of or exposure to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. I called on the Minister yesterday to ensure that every vet dealing with the problem has an opportunity to retrain in this area. I accept the Minister's assurance that arrangements are in place in this regard, but it is an important aspect, as Deputy Dukes said, in terms of the identification of the disease. They must ensure it is not confused with other diseases, such as orf, which has similar symptoms. The food industry is worth £6 billion per annum and, as the Minister said, 80% of our produce is exported. Ireland is highly dependent on the export market and this is where the impact will be felt most.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given calm assurances to the House since this problem was first raised last week and he outlined the measures that have been put in place. I appreciate and acknowledge that his officials are working flat out. It is important not to detain officials during this debate because their prime duty is dealing with the issues on the ground. However, this debate is important and we appreciate the Minister's presence. I acknowledge the work of the officials, but there is a gap between the official statements made by the Minister and the practices on the ground. This is the feedback Deputies have received and there also appears to be a slowness to appreciate the gravity of the situation. There was also a tardiness about putting in place the task force we recommended on Tuesday. That group should have been the first step.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must take a lead in this area. I am not trying to score political points in this and I was disappointed with the comments of some Deputies earlier. However, it is important the Taoiseach leads by example. I suggested he make a broadcast after the main news bulletins at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on television to ensure that every citizen appreciates the seriousness of the problem. All other matters should take second place. The Taoiseach could have easily cancelled his Welsh visit and been present today to deal with this important matter and support his Ministers.</P>
    <P>Another element of the feedback we have received is that there is poor access to information and advice. This is demonstrated in today's media reports. Yesterday, some people went to the Minister's Department on Kildare Street, but there were no mats or disinfecting processes in place. The Government must give a lead. That may appear to be a trivial matter, but an example must be given at every agriculture and Teagasc office throughout the State. They must show a lead and every veterinary officer <Col N="1244" /> must be notified in that regard. As we said last week, that should have been one of the first measures taken.</P>
    <P>The public must be made fully aware of what they can do to minimise the risk of spreading foot and mouth disease to farms in Ireland. Communication of the message and putting in place the appropriate policing and decontamination measures are the Government's responsibility. This is why it must take the lead on this matter. However, it is clear from the feedback we have received from the public that there are still huge gaps in the measures being undertaken in the State to reduce the risk of infection from foot and mouth disease. The ring of steel in the Border counties clearly has holes. It would be foolish not to accept that the task of making the Border watertight is difficult. However, the economic and social consequences of leaving gaps in Border inspections would be so huge that every resource must be put in place to prevent traffic passing through without inspection.</P>
    <P>Sporting organisations throughout the State have acted responsibly and cancelled all sporting events. These organisations have shown great leadership. However, as I said previously, I regret the decision by the Taoiseach to pursue his visit to Wales today. I received communications from many rugby followers who cancelled their trips and who may not get refunds. They said that if they cannot travel, they have no come back. In the light of the Taoiseach's decision to travel to Wales, they feel that maybe they should travel also. They are not going to farms; they are obviously travelling for recreational purposes. Therefore, the example of the Taoiseach is important.</P>
    <P>For those who insist on travelling outside the State, it is vital that upon re-entry each person would go through the disinfection procedure. Information leaflets should be handed out to every air and sea passenger travelling to Ireland, informing them of the devastating consequences of foot and mouth disease and of the need for them to go through the disinfected ports. Any footwear in their luggage should also be treated. Those who have been in contact with farm animals during their trip outside the State should be encouraged to act responsibly and not to return until the crisis has passed.</P>
    <P>Yesterday my aunt, who was to travel home at the weekend, rang me and I told her to cancel her trip. That is what people must do. One must tell people not to travel. This is why the Minister should issue mandatory directions to people and why I said it was unfortunate that the Minister was adopting a softly, softly approach.</P>
    <P>As a school child in 1967, I remember that Masses were called off and people did not have to attend the churches. This is an opportunity before the weekend for the Minister to contact the heads of every denomination in Ireland to ensure that a special message is put out from the pulpits about how important it is that at this stage every farmer should have a disinfection bath at <Col N="1245" /> the farm gate. Every farmer, irrespective of where the farm is based, at least should have a disinfection bath.</P>
    <P>My own people are involved in farming. The time may have come when farmers must register to produce food, that there must be a registration mechanism in place in order to engage in food production. Anybody who breaks the rules regarding farm production should be treated like a company director under section 150 of the Company Law Act, 1963, and disallowed from pursuing that livelihood. The livelihoods of too many good farmers who obey the rules are at stake. All you need is one bad apple to spoil the whole basket. If company directors can be disqualified from holding directorships for a number of years, why should a similar penalty not apply to any farmer who purposely injects an animal in order to gain compensation? These people should be taken out of the equation altogether. They should not be allowed farm again. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>This is a national issue and it permeates everything. It is beyond politics. We are protecting our green gold, the only equivalent to oil in this country. The Minister should take whatever emergency measures are necessary. If it takes tagging, registration or other measures in order that every farmer can be identified, so be it.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the House I received a telephone call from a business person who thought that all the measures were in place because we introduced the CMMS scheme. He said that it would be very easy to identify the 20 sheep which have gone missing because they are tagged, but I told him they were not. He said that he had got the impression a few weeks ago that they were. That is why this outbreak must lead to a fundamental sea change in the attitude governing the way we produce food. If it takes such a move, farmers are prepared to play their role if the views of the farmers I spoke to this morning are anything to go by. Every one of them wants to ensure that they can continue to produce wholesome food. They do not want anybody in their midst who acts in any way which spoils that image and undermines that process.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another practical issue which is not meant as a criticism. According to the media this morning, it seems that the Department does not have a website comparable to that of the British Ministry. This is an important issue and it is critical because an increasing number of people use this new method of absorbing and disseminating information. The Department must use every conceivable method of ensuring that people are aware of the particular problems and my colleague, Deputy Upton, will address this later. It is critical that the Department updates and expands its website in line with that available to British farmers. Every time we log on to the British website, the Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Nick Brown, has added something extra. The farmer's union also adds something to it every day, exhorting and encouraging British <Col N="1246" /> farmers to act in a particular way and to obey the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Those are the issues I would draw to the attention of the Minister. I am trying to be as constructive as possible. Yesterday we asked if there was enough disinfectant to cater for the increased number of disinfection posts in the areas at risk. I have been led to believe that there is a shortage of this product and I understand that companies have been in contact with the Department offering products which might be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Citric acid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Department examines such offers rigorously to make sure they are effective products which deal adequately with the problem. Although I do not want to go into the technical aspects of it, there is a pH range in that regard, as the Minister will be aware. It is crucial that this shortage is addressed without delay.</P>
      <P>I want to renew my call to the Minister to put in place disinfection posts at all offices of the Department because many farmers must drop into their local office of the Department or, indeed, the Department office on Kildare Street on a regular basis to hand in forms or seek advice on filling out forms. In the current situation call upon the Minister to show some degree of leniency in the processing of payments to farmers. Farmers may not be in a position to communicate with the Department and therefore I ask him to show a degree of leniency to those farmers who have upheld the law through thick and thin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to give a further update to the House on this very serious matter. Yesterday I answered Private Notice Questions here for up to two hours and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, did so the previous day for about an hour and a half.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the constructive nature of Deputy Penrose's contribution. He made a number of suggestions which I will seek to take up, but I appreciate the fact that he made no attempt to score political points.</P>
      <P>At this point we do not have foot and mouth disease in the Republic of Ireland. There have been no symptoms and there has not been a clinical case of the disease but we are treating the situation as if that were the case. It is most unhelpful and treasonous for the media to have headlines like &ldquo;It is here&rdquo;, considering the amount of time the chief veterinary officer and other senior people spent this morning alone in contact with our customers worldwide. Over 60 countries were wanting to ban our products because of extremely negative headlines. It does not help the situation whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Deputy said regarding people who break the rules. They should be prosecuted. In fact, in my part of the country there <Col N="1247" /> are people I know who are in jail for breaking the rules. There are some serious problems in this country regarding animal health and people nearly forget that we have a major BSE problem also. There is a person in jail for infecting his own herd by illegally bringing in cattle from outside the jurisdiction. It is hard to believe but it is true. In other cases, people were prosecuted for fiddling with testing procedures for brucellosis and tuberculosis to gain compensation but, as the Deputy stated correctly, there is a very small number of such people. Although their number is minute, nonetheless such people do exist.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a suggestion regarding the registration of farmers. The House enacted the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill which would provide for such registration. In fact, we encountered a great deal of resistance from the farming organisations, especially the main one, the IFA, because it wanted the general public to pay for the cost of it. I think that is quite unreasonable. Similarly, it is quite true that there is no sheep tagging system in this country at present. My Department has sought to introduce such a system and there have been discussions with the social partners over the last year. There has been resistance to sheep tagging, even though its introduction is long overdue. I fully support what Deputies have said on the matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputies should access the Department's website to judge it for themselves. It is as comprehensive as any website that I know of and is updated at least twice daily. All relevant information is available there, including details of symptoms of the disease, clinical signs and the notification procedure.</P>
    <P>From the outset, I have said that we are all in this situation together. Certain aspects of the problem can be dealt with by senior officials and veterinary officers of my Department but the situation demands the co-operation of many agencies and a wide range of people. Indeed, every citizen has a part to play. If people find problems or gaps in the system, we welcome being informed so that the necessary improvements can be made. Just as people exercise their own discretion about calling in their GP on a human health matter, any farmer who sees an animal showing any unusual symptoms should contact his local veterinary officer and the Department. Five help lines were operated in the Department from day one.</P>
    <P>We responded promptly to the constructive suggestion for an inter-agency task force to be set up. The first meeting was chaired by the Taoiseach and I have chaired subsequent meetings, which are held every day at 8 a.m. Due to my involvement in this morning's meeting, I have been criticised by some people for not being on the RTE radio &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme at the same time.</P>
    <P>There is a management dimension to this situation. At this moment, my Department's chief vet<Col N="1248" /> erinary officer and senior officials are present in this House, and rightly so, because this is the national Parliament, but there is also a great deal of other work to be done.</P>
    <P>On the matter of disinfectants, 43 approved products are listed on the website. The Department is maintaining contact on the supply situation with the industry and with the co-op societies whose boards of directors are mostly farmers, including multinational companies such as Glanbia and Kerry. The onus and responsibility lies with them to co-operate together in the interests of their own farmer clients. Surely they cannot expect some official in my Department to go out and buy supplies of disinfectant for them? My latest information, within the past hour, is that there is an adequate supply of disinfectant in the country. There may be some logistical problems in some areas but it is up to all parties concerned to make their very best efforts in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that some consideration should be given to payments to farmers. Thankfully, there are no signs of foot and mouth disease in the Republic of Ireland at present. If it were to happen, it is not possible to say how long the situation might continue. If it went on for three months or six months, then farmers would obviously need to have some income during that time. I will see what can be done, subject to national and EU audit requirements.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline briefly the background to this difficult situation and to review developments of the past week. The first outbreak of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in Essex on the Tuesday of last week, 20 February. The disease has now been confirmed in 33 other cases, on our latest figures. Unfortunately, it is not just localised. There is a wide geographical spread of these outbreaks with the disease now rampant across Great Britain in areas such as Northumbria, Wiltshire, Essex, Anglesea and Devon.</P>
    <P>Suspect cases are under investigation at several other locations, including most recently in Armagh yesterday, 28 February. Yesterday at 7.30 p.m., I asked the chief veterinary officer of my Department to contact his counterpart in Northern Ireland to check the status of that suspect case. At that stage the reply was that a sample had been sent for laboratory analysis in Britain and they were awaiting the outcome. Regrettably, I have just now learned from my officials that the case in Northern Ireland has been confirmed as positive. This indicates just how fast the situation develops.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday morning, on a BBC television programme, the British Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Nick Brown, was quite confident that the situation had been localised in Britain, as there had not been any outbreaks since the previous Friday. Yet, by next day, Monday, all those other outbreaks had occurred, demonstrating how very quickly it happens. On that Monday, I attended a Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels at which the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Ms Bríd Rodgers, was also <Col N="1249" /> present. She was confident enough, at that stage, to seek a derogation to exclude Northern Ireland from the restrictions applicable to Great Britain, on the basis that the problem did not then affect Northern Ireland. Yet, by last night they were treating the case in Armagh as if it was an outbreak and now, unfortunately, it has been confirmed. That is how quickly events move with this virulent disease.</P>
    <P>Following the confirmation of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain, the EU imposed a temporary ban on the exportation from the United Kingdom of susceptible animals, including cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and some other species, and of various milk and other animal products with effect from Wednesday, 21 February. Subsequently, the authorities in Britain imposed a ban on the movement of a range of animals and this has recently been extended for a further two weeks.</P>
    <P>In the context of addressing the major threat posed by foot and mouth disease in Britain, Ireland took a range of measures in the days immediately following the UK ban. That included a ban on imports from Britain and Northern Ireland of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer and a range of animal products from such animals. This measure was already in place before the announcement by the EU Commission of its ban on UK exports.</P>
    <P>Staff of my Department throughout the country and at key access points, such as ports and airports, were put on alert on the same day. Arrangements were made with the Gárda Síochána and the Army for appropriate resources to be sent to the Border area immediately. Advice notices were issued last Thursday to the industry, both directly and<i> via</i> the Food Safety Authority and the Department's own website, on the practical implications of the ban. On Friday, a voluntary ban was imposed on livestock marts in Border counties and on hunting.</P>
    <P>Advice to the general public on the disease and its implications was included in extensive media advertising which went out on Thursday and was carried throughout last weekend, including the Sunday newspapers. I take the point made by Deputy Dukes that much of the advertising material related to various technical aspects of the disease. For the coming weekend, we have booked space for more reader friendly, or &ldquo;in-the-face&rdquo; material, in modern parlance. We did, of course, install telephone help lines from day one. Five lines were operated right through the weekend and every day since, answering calls full-time from the general public.</P>
    <P>Imports of live sheep from Great Britain since 1 February have been monitored and these will now be slaughtered. In the situation which has occurred in County Wexford, the animals concerned have been under surveillance since their importation. They are being slaughtered today as a precautionary measure, even though, thankfully, the laboratory tests have proved negative. The EU veterinary authorities advised all mem<Col N="1250" /> ber states on Tuesday of this week that all sheep imported live from the UK should be slaughtered. I am aware of the understandable concern to which this decision has given rise in County Wexford. It was a precautionary measure only and has no other significance since the tests were negative.</P>
    <P>I gave the House all information available to me yesterday and I have also consulted with Deputy Naughten about another consignment of sheep which came in <i>via </i>Northern Ireland and were slaughtered in a meat processing plant in Athleague, County Roscommon. As far as we know, though we have no proof at this stage, the importation came <i>via</i> the farm in Northern Ireland on which the outbreak of foot and mouth disease has occurred. Those sheep were slaughtered before the ban came into operation and before the outbreak in Great Britain itself. The entire plant at Athleague was placed under veterinary supervision, sanitised and fumigated. All the staff were interviewed individually, as a precautionary measure and, in the case of 12 of them, their farms are now restricted. The surveillance of those farms has not indicated any problems. The matter is being pursued by the RUC, the special branch of the Garda and police in the United Kingdom because of its criminal implications.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made from the outset to ensure the disinfection of vehicles and individuals at entry points. These were enhanced over the weekend. Significant additional resources have been diverted to ensure the arrangements are properly enforced. Anyone travelling to and from Ireland will hear announcements that, because of foot and mouth regulations, they should visit the Department's offices at each of the points of entry. This arrangement, among others, has been enhanced through the erection of additional signs. I have said repeatedly that there is a primary duty on everyone to avail of these facilities. Their co-operation is needed. There is a drugs problem in Dublin not because someone did not do his or her job, but because someone broke the rules and imported illegal drugs. There would not have been armed conflict for many years if people had not been able to smuggle in weapons as large as rocket launchers. As the disinfection arrangements will be difficult to enforce comprehensively, the co-operation of every citizen is needed.</P>
    <P>I do not have difficulty with criticism of weaknesses in the system on which we work when brought to our attention. It was harsh for personnel of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Customs, the Army and the Garda to man checkpoints on the Border in recent days. I take my hat off to them as they have done an outstanding job. That said, Deputies should inform us if there are weaknesses and we will ensure they are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Advice has been given to the public by various means on the measures required to minimise the risk of introducing the disease. This has been done in a range of areas from day one. It was <Col N="1251" /> suggested that local radio should be availed of to spread the message. That has been done. People have become more vigilant as a result and we have received many telephone calls about suspect cases.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth is an unusual disease of which lameness and drooling at the mouth are symptoms. A veterinary officer is sent to all such cases immediately. Six, seven or more cases are under surveillance at any one time. Fortunately, no case of the disease has been identified. Other measures include a ban on sales at livestock marts, controls on the sale of used farm machinery from Great Britain and a ban on the importation of horses from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Irish Rugby Football Union was requested by the Department to cancel the Wales-Ireland rugby match. Following a meeting it agreed to do so. This is at variance with a distortion of truth in a newspaper in my part of the country. Such distortions are of no assistance in dealing with the problem. The Irish Kennel Club was requested to cancel its dog classes at the forthcoming St. Patrick's Day dog show. The Office of Public Works has suspended all arterial drainage works and is closing Dublin Zoo. While much can be done in a mandatory way, the IRFU, the GAA and Dúchas have responded magnificently voluntarily.</P>
    <P>I contacted my counterpart in Wales in an effort to have the Welsh Rugby Football Union cancel the Wales-Ireland match. It was not until a ban was imposed here that the Welsh decided not to proceed with the game. Despite the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain, games will still be held in Great Britain this weekend. The restrictions, controls and measures in place in many areas here are more rigorous than those in place in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Although not susceptible to the disease, all horse and greyhound race meetings have been cancelled. Bord na gCon and the Irish Horseracing Authority have been co-operative. Racehorse trainers are due to meet today to decide whether they should travel to Cheltenham. We have advised them not to do so. In spite of this people in the United Kingdom are acting as if the Cheltenham racing festival will proceed. That is not right or proper. We have asked racehorse trainers in the strongest possible terms not to travel. This plague can travel through the air and can be carried by susceptible animals which pose the highest risk. Even though the animals do not suffer from the disease, their bedding, various animal products and the trucks which transport them can carry it.</P>

      <P>I compliment sports, cultural and other bodies for their actions. The organisers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin made contact with us. Our strong advice to them was that, even though the event is considered to pose a low risk, it was best to avoid large gatherings unless absolutely necessary. As one can imagine, they were devastated, given the amount of work that goes into its organisation. It is a huge disappointment given that tens of thousands come to Dublin each year for it. We regret the inconvenience caused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, despite the fact that it will be a source of huge disappointment and inconvenience and cost them dear.</P>
      <P>A major public information campaign is about to get under way, elements of which will be undertaken by Teagasc, a major advisory agency. It will use its network of offices at which helplines will be established. Deputy Penrose asked that a high level task force be appointed. That has been done. It meets at 8 a.m. every day and is chaired by the Taoiseach and me alternately. It includes other Ministers and key officials from agencies such as Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>Since my speech was written the case in Armagh has proved positive. Appropriate measures, including the introduction of an exclusion zone around the premises, are being taken. According to the media the farm straddles the Border. That is untrue. It is a few miles from it. However, the exclusion zone, the order for which I signed last night, extends to north County Louth. All animal movements into and out of the zone are prohibited. I have copies of the order if anyone wishes to see it. The Garda is supporting the Department in controlling this zone. The suspect case has arisen because sheep imported from Great Britain to a location in Armagh had apparently been at a mart in Carlisle, a location from which other sheep subsequently confirmed as FMD positive were moved. It has emerged that sheep from Great Britain, which may have come through the Armagh farm, may have been illegally imported into Ireland for slaughter at the Athleague plant. This aspect is under intensive investigation and various actions have been taken as a precautionary measure &ndash; such actions relate to the 12 staff who had farm contact.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of the facts at this stage because the matter is subject to RUC and Garda investigation. The full rigours of the law will be brought to bear regarding any criminal activity or illegality involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion zone came into effect last night. By 10.30 a.m. we had sent 15 additional vets to the area to visit every farm. We are asking people to inform the Department of any suspect animals in their area. We will visit suspect animals and <Col N="1253" /> the farmers nearer to the Northern Ireland farm as early as possible.</P>
    <P>As yet, there is no evidence of the presence of foot and mouth disease in the Republic. My Department has checked details regarding the import of sheep since 1 February. I appeal to any farmer who received any such sheep or any processor who has knowledge of such imports to come forward. This is a difficult issue to deal with. We inquired during discussions with the Scottish and Northern Ireland authorities how they knew the number of sheep imported. We were told by the Scottish authorities: &ldquo;We signed for 271&rdquo; and the Northern Ireland authorities told us &ldquo;We weighed them and were then able to assess the number imported&rdquo;. That is unsatisfactory. One cannot do anything about aspects outside one's jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease of all cloven hoofed animals. It is non-lethal in adult animals, although it causes serious production losses. It is characterised by blisters on the tongue and mouth and lameness. There is a great deal of confusion regarding BSE, mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease. It is not a public health matter and there are no safety implications involved.</P>
    <P>The primary method of transmission is by direct contact or via respiratory particles or droplets. However, the disease is often spread by the movement of animals, vehicles, people, equipment, products or animal feed and is believed to have spread from France to the Isle of Wight through the air in 1987. There are no serious health implications although humans in contact with infected animals very occasionally suffer mild respiratory symptoms. Humans do not become infected by eating meat from infected animals.</P>
    <P>An outbreak of foot and mouth disease here would, as has been said, have devastating consequences. In the first instance, there would be a temporary ban on exports of susceptible animals and their products and various controls of animal movements would be imposed. Infected animals as well as in-contact animals would have to be slaughtered and incinerated. The duration of the bans and controls would depend on the scale and range of the outbreak and the success of the controls adopted. However, Ireland would continue to be banned from several markets into the future as a number of importing countries insist on freedom from foot and mouth disease for several years after an outbreak. An outbreak would also significantly impair our capacity in the medium term to market our livestock and livestock products as high quality products because of our white health status.</P>
    <P>The situation is extremely fast-moving and will progress further in the next few days. With everybody's assistance I am hopeful we can avoid an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here and I want to assure the House, as I have done on an almost daily basis for the past week, that this issue is receiving the utmost priority. If there is <Col N="1254" /> any aspect of this matter with which I have not dealt I will do so during Question Time today or I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to deal with them in his contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing us news of confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Armagh the Minister has brought us news that is only one step short of the worst possible news. The disease is now present on this island. It is no longer possible for us to try, on an all-island basis, which is the least difficult one, to keep this disease out. It behoves us to act now as though an outbreak of this disease has been identified in this jurisdiction. I do not say that to run a scare. I think the Minister will agree that if we put in place the kinds of controls that would be enforced if an outbreak were identified, we will be in a much better position, if an outbreak is identified, to contain it. I would like to hear the Minister of State tell this House at the end of this debate that we will act in that manner.</P>
      <P>It would be useful for us to know what we are dealing with. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us how the current outbreak in the UK compares with the outbreak in 1967. It took four months to deal with that outbreak &ndash; 2,300 cases were identified in the UK. In this instance, just over 33 cases, covering a much wider spread of country in the UK than was the case in 1967, have been identified in a little over a week. I would like to see a comparison of how far the 1967 outbreak had gone after eight days compared to the outbreak now facing us.</P>
      <P>I am far from an expert on these matters but looking at the location of outbreaks in the UK, it appears there is an epidemic. A great deal more cases of this disease are likely to be identified in the spaces between the outbreaks which have reached every corner of the UK. I cannot believe they would be so lucky as not to find a great deal more outbreaks in between those areas already identified. There is a pattern and movement of carriage which has given them the current distribution of outbreaks. I am sure these are not the only locations where outbreaks can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked the Tánaiste this morning for her view of what would be the consequences if outbreaks were identified here, and I was astonished that the Tánaiste had so little to say about the matter. The situation would be appalling. If outbreaks of foot and mouth disease are identified here the supply of animals to meat factories and the production of meat and meat products will be affected because animals will not be accepted from identified zones. Similarly the supply of milk to dairy plants will be affected. The more cases identified, the more damage that will be done. We will have exclusion zones where, for all practical purposes, social life will come to an end because of the need to control movement. We will gradually see, starting at the edges and moving in, an erosion of two of our most <Col N="1255" /> important industries, meat and meat products and milk and dairy products.</P>
    <P>The longer the outbreak lasts and the more cases identified, the greater will be the erosion of those industries. The longer it lasts, the greater will be the number of outbreaks identified, the greater will be the number of exclusion zones and the more interference and damage done to the normal social intercourse of rural communities and, depending on where they are located, of towns. We can never be sure where outbreaks will be identified.</P>
    <P>That is what is facing us. If we are to avoid such a situation we have to act now as if that problem has arisen. It was my view, up to yesterday, that the Government was taking more or less the right measures, but too slowly and with not enough vigour. On hearing today's news, the Government is lagging seriously behind what now needs to be done. There are huge deficiencies. I know the impossible cannot be done and there are things that take time to be put in place, but I am baffled that there are still so many deficiencies in the measures put in place.</P>
    <P>One of the newspapers this morning carries a piece by a journalist who travelled from Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire, &ldquo;Just one ferry official and a couple of brown mats represented the national effort to prevent the spread of foot and mouth into Ireland as I stepped off the Jonathan Swift from Holyhead yesterday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down the article we get the good news and the bad news &ndash;&ldquo;The disinfecting of commercial traffic was efficient and thorough, however, camping and other motorised passengers were not being carefully monitored although they, too, had to walk through disinfectant to get to their vehicles on the ship.&rdquo; There was a clear lack of rigour in the application of measures in that case.</P>
    <P>Case after case of deficiencies in the application of these measures have been reported on in recent days. I will list a number of them, some of which have become sufficiently well known as to be notorious. First there was the case of the two young women who came back from an agricultural college in England and, when they &ldquo;made themselves known&rdquo;, as the jargon has it, to officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, their names were taken. They were followed-up afterwards.</P>
    <P>A choir comprising women from a rural area were not even greeted when they arrived back in Shannon from Wales during the past week. There was another case, reported to me also, of someone hill-walking in Northumbria who could not find anyone from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Dublin Airport. There was a case reported on the radio this morning of a passenger on a British Midlands flight from Manchester to Dublin who said there was an indistinct announcement on the aircraft but that she could not find the Department's office in Dublin Airport to present herself for disinfection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> Those are cases that have come to light, cases of people who in two cases of which I have heard said something a Senator colleague said in the other House and other people annoyed enough about the issue to ring one of the radio chat shows. If there are cases such as those we can be sure there are many more cases known by people who are too shy to ring a radio chat show or to talk to a politician.</P>
    <P>We cannot assume that everybody knows about the dangers of foot and mouth disease. We cannot assume that everybody travelling here is aware there is a problem pending. Contrary to what was said in the House yesterday, I am sure that if any of us went out to the street and talked to the first 20 people we met, I would bet any amount of money that one would find four or five of those who would not have a clue what foot and mouth disease was, nor what the implications were or who could not care as they do not know anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that in this city and in every other city and town around the country one will find people who have no idea what foot and mouth disease is, who have no idea how rapidly it can spread and who have no idea that there is any problem in travelling to England. The Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>We can become mesmerised in the House by the fact that we read the newspapers and watch television and listen to the radio. Not everyone does it with the same kind of attention we do. I do not like doing this and am not being personally critical when I say what I am about say about the Taoiseach. I was delighted to find, yesterday, that a suggestion I made to the Minister that the Taoiseach take to the airwaves to speak to the people about this was being taken up. I saw the Taoiseach appear on the television last evening, but he was wasting his time. He did not convey to me any of the urgency of the situation or any of the reality and did not seem to me to give any advice of much worth to anyone. Had I not known much about the problem, he did not leave me with the feeling that I might there and then have decided not to go to see a premiership match in England or not to go to visit a cousin in a rural part of England. That was not the message that came across to me from the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Of the measures that are in place we must wonder how effectively they are being implemented. Like everyone else in the House I have had telephone calls, e-mails and letters by the new time over the past couple of days. People are making simple straightforward points that need to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On disinfection of vehicles, especially at ports, it is not enough to spray the outside of the wheels and the outside of the vehicle. The undersides of the vehicle should also be sprayed as vehicles that come here, especially those that have any connection with farming, carry earth and other material <Col N="1257" /> not only on the wheels and tyres but also on the underside of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>When one brings a car into the local power-jet car wash &ndash; and it has always amused me that they are conscientious enough to do it &ndash; they wash the insides of the wheel arches. The people spraying vehicles coming into the country from England should spray the insides of the wheel arches and the entire underneath surface of the vehicle because that is what is required.</P>
    <P>Another example &ndash; an odd and accidental bit of background seen on television footage the other evening, showed a lorry with a load of turnips in it going to Dundalk coming from Northern Ireland. The wheels and bodywork were being sprayed. These were turnips from Northern Ireland carrying earth from Northern Ireland going to Dundalk. The lorry was sprayed and nobody thought to examine the turnips. How much earth did that lorry bring in and what might it contain? This is an example of adherence to the letter of the law but certainly not to the application of the spirit or the intention of the law. How much more material of that kind is entering the country?</P>
    <P>We must examine how those procedures are carried out and begin to take them seriously. How many people have been told, for example, that disinfectant mats over which vehicles will drive should be long enough to exceed the circumference of the wheel? It is not enough to disinfect a portion of a tyre. That is something people are not being told.</P>
    <P>We will have a situation where, as Deputy Penrose said, we will have disinfectant mats at the entrance to every farm and there will be farms throughout the country where disinfectant mats will not be wide enough to do the job properly unless people are specifically told that that must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister volunteered information yesterday which I was glad to hear, that he would revise and review the manual of procedures to be given to officers of the Department involved in counter measures. I am delighted, and I hope that what is done is done quickly and that it is clear and readily comprehensible.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to ensure that that is given to every vet in the country and to ensure that the information in the British Ministry's website on the symptoms of this disease would be included with that. I have been advised by veterinary practitioners from several parts of the country that the information on the British website about the symptoms of this disease if far clearer and more useful than anything on our current Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development website. I have seen this and it is much clearer and more usable. This should be included with the handbook and information for veterinary officers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister to ensure that this kind of information is made available in places where farmers can have access to it. I suppose one should not advertise in the House, but <Col N="1258" /> if there is not a direct method of communication available through the Department, the Minister will find no better way of getting information of this kind to farmer than through the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>. Given all the paper the Department sends to farmers there should be a way of getting this information to them fairly readily and quickly.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister &ndash; I would like to know if anything has been done about this &ndash; if his Department could give information to local authorities as to what they may do and what they may allow citizens to do. I was told yesterday that a group of farmers in an area of my county wanted to put disinfectant mats at strategic points on three access roads. When they rang the county council to find out what they could do an official told them, &ldquo;I cannot tell you about that; I would have to get sanction from higher up&rdquo;, by which he meant the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that it is made clear to local authorities what they can do and maybe specify the measures people can take without having to ask them for permission. If people want to put mats across a section of a public road clearly they will need authorisation from a local authority. It should be made clear to local authorities what they can do and, preferably, it should be made clear that they can do as much as is required in order to help people to protect themselves in this way.</P>
    <P>Even though there is an apparent outbreak of foot and mouth disease on the island, it is still worthwhile trying to maintain control on the Border. I understand the points made by the Minister about the exclusion zone. One of the difficulties with much of this is how matters are presented. The Minister told us at 4.30 p.m. yesterday that he was setting up an exclusion zone and it was being processed with all haste in the part of the exclusion zone in our jurisdiction. I was told at 7.30 p.m. yesterday that there was no sign of any exclusion zone. The Minister told us he signed the order at 10.30 last night&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At 9.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that an effort was being made to get officials from his Department to visit the farmers in the part of the exclusion zone in this jurisdiction by 10.30 a.m. today. There is at least one farmer in that exclusion zone in our jurisdiction who had not been visited by 10.15 a.m. today. He did not know what was expected of him or what he should do. Although he was under the impression that from approximately 4.30 p.m. yesterday there were things he should be doing, he still did not know what they were this morning. This is not good. Clear information as to what is required and the duties of people in exclusion zones even before there is any question of them being in those zones should be made available quickly by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> If this situation was not so serious many of us on this and the other side of the House, including Deputy Kirk, would have laughed out loud when we were told this morning that 299 Border crossings are being policed by 400 gardaí and 200 soldiers, a total of 600 persons. This means there are two people per crossing for 24 hours. This is not policing Border crossings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is revising the way advertising is carried out. I again ask him, the Taoiseach and the Government to make a specific commitment to getting across publicly and as simply and starkly as they can the message that people should avoid travelling to England or inviting people from England to come here unless it is absolutely necessary and they should avoid going to events here or anywhere else where large numbers of English people will be, for example, dog shows, horticultural shows, boat shows, food fairs, etc. Every gathering at which there will be English people should be avoided not because they are English but because foot and mouth disease is rampant in that country. We should act as if there was already an outbreak here.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister in congratulating those organisations which have already cancelled events. The Government should tell people planning large events &ndash; one of which is on this weekend, while another is on St. Patrick's Day &ndash; to revise their plans and, if possible, to cancel the event because the risks are too high to contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to organisers who have cancelled events and ask those considering cancellation to follow their lead in the national interest. I also pay tribute to members of the security forces, some of whom have been injured, working on the front line. It is important to recognise their efforts. I sympathise with those people who have lost money. This morning on radio a Mr. Walsh from Wexford said he would suffer financial loss without, it seems, any compensation. It now seems as if St. Patrick's Day will be a stay-at-home day. This will bring home to those people not involved in farming the gravity of the crisis and emergency facing all of us.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the foot and mouth disease outbreaks in England in 1967 and in Ireland in 1941. I agree with Deputy Dukes that we must look at these cases to see what lessons can be learned and to remind us of what can happen. One of the reasons for the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England and the threats on our doorstep on this island is the huge increase in the transportation of animals since that time. We must take stock of the necessity for some of these journeys. It has been stated that the same animals were transported back and forth and we need to look at this issue more closely to ensure this practice is minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> Intensification of production has been a feature of the industry since 1967. Regulation has taken hold and this has focused on global free trade. There is huge competition with cheap imports and huge pressures on farming. These are changes which have to be taken into account when looking back at the time when foot and mouth disease was a problem. The Border controls are not as tight throughout continental Europe as they were at that time. There are inconsistencies in a number of EU regulations which need to be looked at because they put enormous pressure of regulation on European farmers, which is only right, for example, the blocking of the BST genetic hormone in the EU while we have allowed the BST genetic hormone from the USA. The pressures on Irish farmers are severe and the regulations have to be consistent. We should look at that as we learn lessons from this crisis. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be familiar with the poultry industry in his constituency. That chickens are imported from Thailand is an issue in areas of Ireland where poultry is an important industry.</P>
    <P>Essentially the policy that has developed since 1967 and the Second World War is one of high yield at low prices. This crisis teaches us that there is no such thing as food at a low price. One pays either at the beginning or at the end. If a crisis such as this grows, prices will probably be higher than any of us could have predicted because of the way our systems are vulnerable to the spread of disease, which appears to be the case.</P>
    <P>I agree with the IFA, and I have been involved in a number of different debates, that our food export business is to Ireland what diamonds are to South Africa or oil is to Arabia. Much of the foot and mouth disease problem is caused by imports rather than exports. We have got to take account of people such as Professor Richard Lacey who in 1988 was pilloried for suggesting that humans could catch CJD from eating meat carrying BSE. He is being direct about it when he writes in the paper to say we can attribute foot and mouth disease directly to our industrialised agriculture and food systems. He said the immediate key to it is centralised production and that we should maximise to whatever extent is economically advantageous and feasible local food and local shops. He said things may go wrong but the disease does not spread in the same way when there is more emphasis on the attitude to food than the increasing globalisation which has put many farmers out of business.</P>
    <P>The immediate work for today is the message that this is a national disaster, an emergency, a crisis, for which 200 troops are hardly an adequate response. I agree with those who said we have to maximise our security at check-points. There have been complaints by a number of farmers along the Border that they have neither been stopped nor have they seen any sign of a crisis in the level of check-points on many of the <Col N="1261" /> minor roads. Those complaints have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There was Operation Matador some years ago. I wonder whether we can convey the level of crisis again by sending out the message that this is Operation Foot and Mouth Disease of a high profile nature. The washing of vehicles in Ireland is an idea that is foreign to many, unlike in other countries where inspectors wipe their hands underneath vehicles to check that they are clean and do not leave mud on roads. We have a little way to go in Ireland but we need that type of compliance and as yet it has not come from leadership in Government.</P>
    <P>Many people are being blamed. Even the IFA was blamed on radio this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for not allowing tags on sheep. The Government has the power and the leadership and should make the decisions rather than follow others who are not in power. This crisis is far worse than in 1967. According to scientists it is a more virulent foot and mouth disease outbreak. It needs to be shown to vets, food producers and the general public exactly what is meant by foot and mouth disease in terms of symptoms. The Minister mentioned unusual symptoms but as the maxim says a picture paints 1,000 words. We have not seen the demonstation pictures in newspapers and on television perhaps because of the fear of frightening people. Shock treatment is needed because that awareness is not as widespread as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    <P>The regulation is dependent on personnel being available, the quantity of disinfectant and prosecution procedures taking their course, all of which are emergencies. I am of the view that the emergency task force is not being given adequate urgency. The Departments of the Taoiseach, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence, Marine and Naatural Resources, Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise and Education and Science have all been mentioned but the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as the custodian of public broadcasting is where action needs to be taken as an emergency. This is the same as a declaration of war. It is as serious as that in terms of the public broadcaster, in particular RTE. RTE has so many advertisements for drink, confectioneries, toys etc., that we are bombarded by them. We have not seen graphic images and hard hitting messages about foot and mouth disease. As I mentioned on the Order of Business this morning the Wildlife (Amendment) Act would limit the cutting of hedges from 1 March but the regulations have not been introduced. I ask the Minister to ensure those regulations are implemented. The law is there but it is not being implemented.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of public consciousness in regard to foot and mouth disease and shock treatment is needed. If one mentions Sellafield, suddenly people waken up and think of images of Chernobyl, Hiroshima and the devastation that causes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> An emergency plan which is in place in the case of a nuclear fallout is the kind of plan needed in this case. It is not about evacuating people but about restricting movement. The same level of urgency needs to apply. In Mexico and the southern states of the US there have been training programmes on foot and mouth disease outbreak in the event of it happening. Where is the actual emergency response where everybody knows his or her role and what he or she should do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As one would have gleaned from the newspapers it has direct relevance to my constituency in County Louth because of the proximity of Meigh to the Louth-Armagh border. We had an opportunity last evening during the question and answer session to make a number of points to the Minister on combating the problem on the ground. We should not underestimate the logistical requirements as far as tackling the problem is concerned. I listened attentively to the points made by Deputy Dukes, many of which were relevant. The matter of greatest urgency is the difficulty with the land border between the Six Counties and the Republic. Given that there has been an outbreak in close proximity to the Border and that a significant number of animals appear to have come to the south, I hope all the animals in Athleague were slaughtered.<i></i>I do not know if the Department is yet in a position to confirm that the 291 imported animals have all been accounted for. It is important to be able to account for these animals from the point of view of the control measures that are in place. If a number of these animals mix with the national live sheep flock, the implications are obvious and very serious.</P>
      <P>The Department's veterinary surgeons throughout the Border areas are doing their best and appreciate the co-operation of the local communities, particularly the farming communities. The farming organisations are being very supportive and co-operating with the efforts of the Department on the ground. However, there is a need for more Army personnel on the ground. Anyone who knows the Border area from Donegal to Omeath, County Louth, will be aware of the multiplicity of Border crossings. This provides many opportunities for livestock to be transported via small crossings, therefore, a crossing could be omitted easily from what should be blanket coverage of these roadways. There are Army barracks in Dundalk and Cavan and as many Army personnel as possible should be deployed to the Border areas to support this effort. A number of my constituents have been in contact with me on this matter. I am sure the veterinary unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has moved as many veterinary personnel as possible to north Louth to bolster the manpower needs in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me, I want to make a few points. I did not hear what the Mini<Col N="1263" /> ster of State, Deputy Davern, said this morning about sheep tagging. I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has been doing his best to convince farming organisations of the necessity to address this issue. Now is the time to push ahead with this issue because the identity of each animal is absolutely essential for traceability purposes and control. While a significant control structure has been put in place for cattle, a similar arrangement is not in place for sheep. It is not insignificant that the current problem has a lot to do with the movement of sheep purchased at the Carlisle market to the North and then on to Athleague in Roscommon. I do not know where other animals may have been moved but I hope the animals on the farm in Meigh have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly unique marketing structure in this country whereby people involved in the cattle and sheep dealing business operate without controls at State level. The time has come to introduce a licensing system for people operating in the industry. Transporting live animals from point A to point B, from one mart to another, from a farm to a mart and back to another farm, without accountability through a licensing system, is not acceptable. While there are more urgent matters to be addressed, this issue needs to be considered very quickly.</P>
    <P>In the Border counties, North and South, a significant number of people are operating in this area. I do not know if veterinary personnel have identified these people and asked for their co-operation in providing as much detailed information as possible in relation to their activities in recent months. This would be invaluable to the veterinary controls which are required urgently. Given the great sense of anxiety on the ground, many of these people would be willing to volunteer the information. I suggest that the Minister should establish on a confidential basis an information line in the local district veterinary office in Drogheda. That would allow people to report livestock movement which could fall into the suspicious category. The availability of this information would be absolutely invaluable to personnel of the Department.  </P>
    <P>I am worried about the mood of hysteria surrounding this debate, which is understandable in many respects. However, the Minister and his officials must step back from the hysteria and decide what are the logistical arrangements which will be effective, provide the necessary reassurance and, more importantly, combat this very serious threat. Deputies Sargent and Dukes suggested drawing a comparison with the 1967 statistics. I do not think such a comparison would be of much benefit at this point given the structural changes that have taken place in the agriculture industry both here and in the UK. The economic reality is that there have been profound changes in the intervening period in the agriculture industry as a result of the significant intensification which has taken place. The position in the industry at present is vastly different from what it was <Col N="1264" /> in 1967. While this comparison might be useful for statistical purposes on a week to week basis, it would be very unwise to take political decisions on that basis alone.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that if we do not succeed in keeping the foot and mouth epidemic out of this country the consequences will be dire &ndash; that is not an over-statement. The agriculture-food industry is worth £9 billion. Despite the developments that have taken place elsewhere in the economy over the past five to ten years, this industry is pivotal to the well-being of the economy. I put it to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, today that, regardless of what it takes, let us put the resources in place to combat this epidemic. There must be consultations on the ground and, if effective changes are needed, let us make them, because the implications of foot and mouth for this country are very dire indeed and would bode serious ill for the future of our food industry.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that there is significant co-operation between veterinary personnel North and South, the sooner we can get one animal health veterinary regime in place on the whole island the better, as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement and the new structures being put in place. The economic benefits of this are obvious. The best barrier of all against disease, particularly foot and mouth, are the seas around our coast. If there was a uniform harmonised veterinary regime on the whole island, the benefit to the food industry from a marketing point of view and to primary production generally would be very significant. If Bord Bia and the other agencies could say to countries around the world that we have an island nation, that we have the finest food in the world and our borders are protected by the sea, we would be able to command a premium price for our produce in the marketplace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing this issue to be addressed in the House today. This is the biggest threatened economic crisis to hit Ireland in living memory. Foot and mouth disease has major implications, not only for farmers but for the food industry, its employees, road hauliers, exporters and the economy as a whole. The food industry in Ireland is more dependent on exports than in any other state within the EU. We export over £5 billion worth of food every year, which equates to nine out of ten cattle, or three quarters of every gallon of milk produced. The sheepmeat sector is the most dependent on exports. There are 130,000 farmers in the country and 200,000 are employed within the agri-business industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly I am the Member of the House at the epicentre of the current concern regarding this disease. The sheep involved were purchased in Carlisle and shipped to Northern Ireland for slaughter. The Scottish authorities certified that 291 sheep were transported to Northern Ireland where Department of Agriculture officials claimed that 271 sheep arrived at the port. This was estimated by weighing the lorry. Some 21 <Col N="1265" /> sheep were destroyed in south County Armagh yesterday. In all probability they had foot and mouth disease. A further 248 were slaughtered at the Kepak plant in Athleague, County Roscommon. Transport and ownership of the sheep is currently under investigation and I wish the Department every success with that. The Minister informed me that two other sheep involved in this consignment had died. This brings the total to 271, the figure the Northern Ireland authorities estimate arrived at port. There still remains a discrepancy between the Scottish permit of 291 and the Northern Ireland figure of 271. What action is the Department taking to resolve this? Twenty sheep are unaccounted for. In all probability they have, or are carrying, foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>What route did the transport of the sheep take from Northern Ireland? Why is the driver involved gone missing? Why were the sheep booked into the Kepak plant in the name of another farmer? Where were the sheep between the time they entered Northern Ireland and slaughtered at the plant? Anyone implicated in this issue should be dealt with severely by the full rigour of the law for facilitating the import and slaughter of these animals. It must be acknowledged we are fortunate to the extent that 248 sheep were slaughtered, because had they been distributed among the flock herds south of the Border the impact would have been catastrophic. The Minister said that the sheep appear to have been illegally imported into Ireland. It is difficult for him to be any more definitive because a court case may be pending.</P>
    <P>When I questioned the Minister in the House yesterday as to when the Department was informed that the farm in south County Armagh was under suspicion he replied: &ldquo;That happened a day or so after the ban was imposed &ndash; the ban was imposed last Wednesday after which it was placed under surveillance.&rdquo; Why has it taken a week for an exclusion zone to be imposed on the southern side of the Border?</P>
    <P>There is currently an eight mile exclusion zone around the farm in south County Armagh. However, Mr. P. J. Quinn, Professor of Veterinary Microbiology and Parasitology at UCD, has stated that there must be an absolute embargo on the movement of all animals within a 29 kilometre radius of the outbreak. Will the exclusion zone be extended because the outbreak has been confirmed? What measures have been put in place to extend it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes told the Minster that we must treat the present situation as if foot and mouth disease is already in Ireland. What measures are being taken on the farms in County Roscommon and east County Galway? While the threat is remote, there is a possibility that the disease has taken hold. What measure have been taken to restrict the movement of people and animals in both these counties? Are the bridges over the River Shannon and the River Suck being policed to ensure there is no movement? Are additional resources being given to the Army or the gardaí <Col N="1266" /> to ensure that no movement is taking place in the areas specified by the Department? A fortnight ago the Garda Síochána used resources at its disposal to mount checkpoints throughout Connacht. Similar steps should be taken immediately in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>There are 299 Border crossings, which are manned by 600 Garda and Army personnel. The Minister should ensure that every person available to the Garda and the Army, no matter where they are located in the country, should be asked to man the Border crossings. Not even God would be able to block sheep being moved south of the Border if, after confirmation of this case in Northern Ireland, a ban is imposed on exports of livestock and carcases. Economic realities dictate that sheep will be brought across the Border for slaughter. Greedy individuals will use such a ban to exploit the system and Irish farming. It is fundamentally important that proper policing measures are put in place along the Border to ensure its integrity is maintained.</P>
    <P>Yesterday every road in and out of Cornwall were covered with disinfectant mats because the farmers are so concerned about an outbreak of the disease. We should consider similar measures in this country. They should initially be laid along the Border crossings and around the suspected areas in Counties Wexford, Kerry, Roscommon and east Galway. I urge the Minister to ensure that is done.</P>
    <P>What measures have been taken to deal with milk collections and to ensure that milk collection lorries are disinfected? A number of parents have expressed concern about schools. Should they be closed or restricted? What is being done in this area? Deputy Penrose expressed concern about mass attendance over the weekend.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there is much concern in County Roscommon about the latest developments. The Department must issue instructions specific to the area under investigation. They should be announced on the local radio this afternoon, not tomorrow. I know the Garda has received numerous queries in relation to this concern.</P>
    <P>On the shipment of these sheep across the Border, as the Minister said, the Garda and the RUC are involved. It is obvious that it is a case of fraud. The Minister has the full support of this House in applying the full rigours of the law and in ensuring strict measures are taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact the Minister is here today and has facilitated this debate. I also acknowledge the very hard work and commitment of Department officials in the last week or two because I have no doubt it has been very traumatic and difficult for them as well. I also recognise the fact that voluntary organisations have been very supportive and on side. It is important that these facts are recognised and acknowledged here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease is a most contagious and devastating animal disease. We now know that it is on this island and we have to accept the <Col N="1267" /> fact the virus is here and that we are in a crisis. I know it has been said many times already but it bears repeating that the foot and mouth virus is of no significance to the food chain in terms of food safety or public health. That is based on the best scientific knowledge on that at present and it should be repeated over and over again. Unfortunately, I continue to get queries about this and I am asked about the significance. We may have failed to transmit that message effectively.</P>
    <P>This is a most devastating animal disease and the economy of this country will be wrecked if foot and mouth gets a hold here. The first victims will be the farming community and the food industry but the casualties will be much wider than that. That is something of which we have to take account. Deputy Kirk mentioned that there was an air of hysteria in relation to foot and mouth disease but I must disagree with him on that. To some extent, the opposite is the case. In certain quarters, there has been an air of complacency. For instance, the fact people are still considering going to Wales, although the rugby match has been cancelled, and continue to have such a mindset does not smack of hysteria but of total complacency. We have failed to get through to these people that there is a very significant economic issue at stake here and that any movement that is non-essential should be curtailed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that the virus affects all cloven hoofed animals but it also affects vermin &ndash; rats and hedgehogs. I mention this in the context of vermin, no more than the virus, having no respect for borders. I would like the Minister to take some account of how that issue might be addressed and whether it is considered to be of any significance. The rat population in this country has increased quite significantly. How does one contain that? What does one put in place to even look at that issue which is very important? </P>
    <P>The incident in Roscommon raises very serious questions about traceability. This has been mentioned by practically everybody who spoke. Last week I was concerned about the traceability of food in relation to BSE but today the implications of the lack of traceability of animals has surely been brought home to us all in terms of the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a certain air of confusion and, to some extent, a lack of clarity about the measures which have been put in place. Up to this morning, having listened to the news headlines and the chat shows, reports that were quite worrying continued to come in. I know the Minister has addressed some of these but I still think there is an air of complacency in relation to airports and ports and the actions that are being taken. These are the only check-points we have in terms of the import of the virus into the country. We need to look very carefully at the operational procedures that are in place.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier this week that the disinfection programme was largely cosmetic. There is a very real difficulty in providing an effective <Col N="1268" /> disinfection programme. Matters such as the presence of organic matter, soil, for example, and vegetable material, will simply mop up the disinfectant and render it inactive. The fine detail of how the disinfectant is applied and the renewal of the disinfectant on a regular basis is absolutely essential if the disinfection programme is to be anything more than a cosmetic exercise. I emphasise again that we cannot take it for granted that the disinfection procedure is working. We have to look at the implications of the residue of organic material on tyres, clothing and materials. This will simply mop up the disinfectant and render it ineffective.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I asked about the training programmes in place for vets, farmers and for the personnel operating at the various Border posts, the airports and the ports. No farmer would ever have seen a case of foot and mouth disease and only a very limited number of veterinarians would have. We need to be very proactive in keeping them informed and up to speed in relation to all the developments.</P>
    <P>We are in the middle of a crisis and are developing an emergency plan as we go along. I do not think this should have been the case. We have in place a national emergency plan in the event of a nuclear accident, for instance. The probability of serious outbreak of an animal disease was always much greater than the risk of a nuclear accident so I do not think it is being very proactive to say that we are now effectively putting in place an emergency plan on a daily basis. There are various models available. One will find a model that is available in Canada on the Internet. Canada does not have foot and mouth disease but it has an emergency plan in the event of the disease occurring there. There is an important lesson to be learned from this, that is, that we need to plan for the unlikely and the unexpected.</P>
    <P>A number of Members mentioned the need for the licensing of farmers. I emphasise that the licence to practise one's profession is the norm in most professions. We should now stringently apply this to the farming profession as well. We have to have in place a system where we can remove the right to practise one's profession &ndash; the right to remove a licence if that should arise. This is the only effective way we will be able to impose controls. Financial penalties have had little or no effect in the past. The removal of the right to practise one's profession is the ultimate sanction.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to spell out the details of the contingency plan. It is clear that the disease has reached epidemic proportions in the UK. Again, it raises the need for expertise in epidemiology in this country. What kind of emergency plan is in place and what are the epidemiological implications of the outbreak and spread of the disease in the country? Who will co-ordinate the plan and put it in place? Who will be in charge <Col N="1269" /> of the operational day to day procedures if we have an outbreak?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised on a number of occasions in the Dáil, most recently on 7 February, and I have always <Col N="1270" /> endeavoured to provide as much information as possible. In doing so again, I must emphasise that I am constrained by a number of factors. I ask Deputies to be equally mindful of these factors as they have been on any occasion this matter has been raised.</P>
      <P>This is a complex matter and a number of issues have yet to be resolved. A number of civil actions have been initiated: the Director of Public Prosecutions is examining the question of criminal proceedings in a number of cases; complaints have been lodged with the Garda Síochána Complaints Board; and the question of possible disciplinary action against members of the Garda Síochána may have to be considered by the commissioner.</P>
      <P>All these factors place an onus on us to be careful in what we may say about the matter in hand. It is essential that the truth of the matter is determined and that, in this process, the rights of all concerned are upheld and vindicated. We must be careful not to prejudice proceedings which may arise from the matter in question.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the question of criminal prosecutions is a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions and that I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no role in the prosecution of individuals for criminal offences. It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment in this regard and, accordingly, I do not propose to do so.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that this matter has been the subject of ongoing speculation and that various reports appeared in the media over the weekend. For the reasons advanced, this speculation is not helpful. For our part, as Members of this House, we should be careful not to add to the speculation about the case and, accordingly, I do not intend to make any further comment in this respect except to say that, as the matter is still being considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions, nobody has been charged to date arising from the investigation in question.</P>
      <P>In addition to the investigation conducted by Assistant Commissioner Carty, two other investigations relating to County Donegal were initiated. One, conducted by Assistant Commissioner Murphy, relates to matters raised by the then Opposition spokesmen on justice and the other investigation, conducted by a chief superintendent relates to a matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in County Donegal concerning the original investigation. The results of these investigations are still awaited.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if any member of the Garda Síochána has been suspended in relation to the investigation. I am informed by the Garda authorities that one member was suspended in 1999 and remains on suspension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might have been implicated in wrongdoing. It is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members are investigated thoroughly <Col N="1271" /> and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is in both the public interest and the interest of gardaí that the ongoing investigations be brought to a conclusion and that whatever steps are required as a consequence be taken without delay? Does the Minister acknowledge that the uncertainty surrounding these matters has cast a cloud over the integrity of members of the force in the Donegal area and that this is unfair to the vast majority of the force who do their jobs in a proper manner? When will the two outstanding investigations be completed? Does the Minister acknowledge that it is time those investigations yielded some kind of result or report?</P>

The allegations have left a cloud hanging over certain members of the Garda in County Donegal. We hope to resolve that matter at the earliest possible opportunity. I concur with the Deputy's statement that the vast majority of gardaí go about their business with the greatest integrity. I am still awaiting the two final reports which I hope to receive in the near future.</P>

That speculation is damaging members of the force and undermining public confidence in the Garda. Does the Minister agree that it is in the public interest to ensure that if anyone is found guilty of wrongdoing, it will be speedily addressed? Although I acknowledge that it is not the Minister's responsibility, it is time decisions were made as to whether people should be prosecuted. Have any internal Garda disciplinary procedures commenced with regard to any of the allegations? Will the Minister explain the reason his Department, having decided to release papers under the Freedom of Information Act to the McBrierty family on the tragic death of Richard Barron subsequently had a change of mind, failed to release the papers, but was subsequently required by the Information Commissioner to implement its original decision? Will the Minister explain the rationale behind his Department's approach to this particular aspect of the County Donegal investigation? </P>

    <P>Prisoners have succeeded in escaping by using a variety of means, including pulling out syringes in the course of an escort and demanding that their handcuffs be removed, breaking through windows in the holding cells of courthouses, climbing out of hospital windows and, in one recent incident, armed intervention by associates.</P>
    <P>When an escape occurs from a prison escort, the Garda Síochána is immediately notified and takes whatever steps possible to apprehend the prisoner. An investigation into the circumstances <Col N="1273" /> surrounding the incident is conducted by the prison governor. Where appropriate, operational procedures are reviewed and enhanced. It should be noted that the vast majority of these escapees have since been recaptured and returned to prison to complete their sentences. A few have returned voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The most recent incident occurred on Sunday, 18 February 2001. A prisoner escaped during the course of an escort to a neutral venue to meet his mother who was unable to visit him in the prison for health reasons. The prisoner was serving a nine year sentence for a most serious sexual offence and he was due for release on 19 September 2002. The prisoner was escorted from the prison to the venue in the company of three prison officers. A number of similar outings had taken place previously to the same venue without incident. The standard procedure in this type of escort is that the area in which the meeting was to take place would be examined to ensure the staff were satisfied with the security arrangements. The officers were deployed around the venue. Under the pretence of going to the toilet, the offender escaped through a back door. Staff conducted a search of the area and contacted the prison which, in turn, notified the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Garda was provided with details on the prisoner, including a recent photograph, last known address, physical description and details on his victim. It would be an operational decision for the Garda whether to notify the general public about the escape, but I can confirm that the victim's family was notified at the earliest possible time. I express my personal regret at the additional distress this episode has undoubtedly caused to the victim.</P>
    <P>The prisoner returned voluntarily to Arbour Hill on Monday, 26 February 2001 at approximately 9 p.m. The Governor of Arbour Hill has conducted an investigation into the incident, including the circumstances of his release under escort from the prison and the events leading up to his escape. His report was forwarded to the Director General of the Prison Service and me yesterday. The report contains a number of issues of concern which the director is addressing as a matter of urgency. For security reasons, it would be appropriate for me to go into further detail on this aspect. I fully understand that such incidents cause public concern. In order to safeguard both the prison staff and the general public, every precaution must be taken to prevent their recurrence. I was shocked that a prisoner who was convicted of such a serious offence was able to escape.</P>
    <P>Following the spate of recent escapes the director general of the prisons service set up an expert review group to examine the circumstances of each escape, to review escorting procedures and the equipment used in such escorts. The areas being examined include transport arrangements, staff training, the profiling of prisoners, searching procedures, the use of handcuffs and batons and the situation in relation to key-holders. This <Col N="1274" /> group, whose members include the head of operations in the Irish Prisons Service and two senior prison governors, made significant progress. I cannot provide exact details, on security grounds, but I am informed by the director general that this group has identified areas where immediate improvement is possible. New guidelines will shortly issue to all prison governors. The review group continues to examine other issues which require longer-term actions and may involve other agencies, including the Courts Service and the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is the nature of prison escorts that there is always an element of risk in transporting prisoners outside a prison. It is, however, estimated that less than one in every thousand escorts result in an escape bid by a prisoner. The vast majority of escorts effected by prison officers are completed without incident. There have been many occasions, usually unreported, where prison staff, by their vigilance and professionalism, have prevented the escape of prisoners, often when faced with considerable threat.</P>

      <P>Why was the most recent escape kept secret from the public from Sunday until Thursday, and only released following a media inquiry? If there had not been an inquiry, would we never have known about the escape? When was his Department informed of the escape? What is the Minister's personal opinion of the community's right to know of the escape of a convicted and dangerous rapist? Is it the Minister's view that the community into which the prisoner escaped has a right to be informed immediately? Was the temporary release to visit a relative sanctioned by his Department?</P>

      <P>Decisions on requests for escorted outings are generally made by senior officials. Some cases are submitted for recommendation to me. The standard procedure was not followed in this case. This will be examined by the director general of the prison service. It must be examined in greater detail and that is being done.</P>
      <P>On the question of informing the public, the Garda were notified of the escape immediately. As in all such cases, my Department was informed as early as possible and the victim's family the following morning. The question of making an announcement arising from the risk to the public is a Garda operational matter. It is not an issue for me as Minister. The staff conducted a search of the area and then notified the prison, which contacted the Garda. They were provided with details of the prisoner &ndash; a recent photograph, physical description, last known address and details of the victim.</P>
      <P>The investigation is continuing and should be completed soon. I received a preliminary report yesterday evening which was unsatisfactory. I await a further report.</P>

Will he acknowledge that he cannot abdicate his responsibility to the Garda Síochána? As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responsible for running the prison service, does he not have a duty to ensure that the public is forewarned? Would the Minister accept that four prisoners escaping in five weeks is unacceptable, that it indicates a breakdown in the prison service's procedures to transport prisoners? Is he aware that an assurance was given to the House, only three days before this escape, by a Minister of State on his behalf, that the level of security on escorts would be appropriate to the offence committed by the prisoner and steps would be taken to prevent further escapes? What assurance can the Minister now give that there will be no other escapes in the coming weeks? What new procedures have been put in place to deal with the difficulties?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the progress made to date in the preparation of the disabilities Bill; if any consideration has been given to possible constitutional change in order to strengthen the Bill; when the Bill will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>A commitment has been given in the Government's legislative programme to publish the disabilities Bill in 2001. Preparatory work is under way in our Department and a broad-ranging consultative process was undertaken late last year. It is our intention that the disabilities Bill will be a positive action measure to advance and underpin the participation of people with disabilities in society. The measure we propose will be broad in scope and ground-breaking in nature. The Deputy will appreciate that the qualitative approach we propose will require an input of time and expertise from several quarters and any lesser commitment on my part would be to short-sell people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The disabilities Bill will be the fourth legislative measure in the area of disability equality sponsored by this Government and has been progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructural framework for equality which the Government has put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000 prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including the ground of disability in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. The Equality Authority and Director of Equality Investigations, established to implement this legislation, are now fully operational. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency dedicated to disability policy and practice. The disabilities Bill will build on and complete this framework for equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the constitutional review group has recommended that the following amendment to Article 40.1 of the Con<Col N="1277" /> stitution be proposed in the next tranche of amendments to be put to the electorate:</P>
    <P>All persons shall be held equal before the law and that no person shall be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on any ground such as sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, colour, language, culture, religion, political or other opinion, national, social or ethnic origin, membership of the travelling community, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is fully in line with a proposal in this area by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. It is my understanding that the current constitutional position will allow provision to be made in the disabilities Bill for the range of proactive measures envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation was promised by Fianna Fáil in 1997 before the last election and in the programme for Government, yet it is not now promised until the end of the year. People with disabilities are being misled, as it is unlikely the legislation will be fully proceeded with in the lifetime of this Government. The Minister of State referred to the Equal Status Act, which was dealt with by the Oireachtas in April 2000, nearly a year ago. The timescale in this regard is unacceptable. Promises were made that disability legislation would be before the House much sooner than now appears to be the intention. Can the Minister clarify the intention to amend the Constitution in accordance with the proposals she outlined? A number of cases concerning the educational rights of people with disabilities are before the courts. Will this issue be addressed in the legislation? Can the Minister tell me how many such cases are before the courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Returning to promises in the programme for Government, I remind the Deputy that everybody thought the previous Government's Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill would be passed. As she will recall, they were found to be unconstitutional and when this Government took office none of this legislation was on the Statute Book. The Bills had to be redrafted and brought through the Oireachtas again. It was a huge achievement of this Government to put the two anti-discrimination measures on the Statute Book, considering the constitutional difficulties encountered by the previous Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that Deputy O'Sullivan recognises the work had to be done again. The National Disability Authority Act was passed which set up the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority and the office of the <Col N="1278" /> Director of Equality Investigations, which was a huge body of work. The Deputy mentioned the Equal Status Act was passed in April 2000. The National Disability Authority was in place by June, as were ground breaking measures such as incorporating the training and employment of people with disabilities by groups like FÁS into the mainstream from a segregated area. All of that work was bedded down at that point, and it is important that Deputy O'Sullivan sees that we are now trying to complete any remaining areas of legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government has covered the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities regarding anti-discrimination measures for people with disabilities. The Deputy also asked about a possible constitutional amendment. The constitutional review group has recommended that an amendment to Article 40.1 be made. It is proposed that such an amendment will be in the next tranche to go before the electorate.</P>

      <P>The broad mandate of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000, is to work towards the elimination of conduct prohibited under the equality legislation; to promote equality of opportunity in relation to the matters covered under the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act; to provide information to the public on the workings of the two equality Acts, the Parental Leave Act, 1998, the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995; and to keep under review the workings of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 and the workings of the Pensions Act, 1990 as regards the principle of equal treatment.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998 came into operation with effect from 18 October 1999; the Equal Status Act, 2000 came into operation with effect from 25 October 2000. The authority is empowered to develop draft codes of practice for the approval of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to conduct equality reviews and prepare action plans. It may conduct formal inquiries and, where it finds evidence of discrimination, it may direct that such discrimination be redressed. The authority may seek a High Court or Circuit Court injunction in respect of persistent discrimination and it has the sole right to initiate proceedings in cases of discriminatory advertisements, pressure on persons to discriminate and general policy of discriminatory practices. Under section 8 of the Equal Status Act, 2000, the authority, as well as a member of the public, may make application to the District Court for that court's determination that a particular private registered club has a discriminatory rule, policy or practice etc. contrary to the equal status legislation.</P>
      <P>As at the end of January 2001, the Equality Authority had received over 2,150 inquiries under the Equal Status Act, 2000. The authority is now handling 90 equal status cases referred to it for advice by members of the public. The breakdown of the cases, under the nine grounds, is as follows: age, 18; disabilities, nine; family status, two; gender, four; marital status, nil; race, three; religion, nil; sexual orientation, three; and membership of the Traveller community, 51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Equality Authority is involved with 14 referrals to the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and is currently providing representation in three of those cases. The question of representation in the remaining cases is currently under consideration by the Equality Authority. Of the 14 cases, seven relate to age, one to race, two to disability and four to the Traveller ground. One of the cases under the Traveller ground involves ten separate claimants in relation to one single respondent. The balance of 76 are currently being processed by the authority. That involves gathering further detailed information and providing legal advice to complainants prior to a <Col N="1280" /> decision being taken as to whether the authority will grant them legal representation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Equality Authority's budget for 2001 is £3.669 million. Publications of the Equality Authority and of the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, which give full details of the activities of both bodies, include the respective 1999 annual reports of the Equality Authority and of the Office of the Director, as well as the Equality Authority's Strategic Plan 2000-2002. Those publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Initiatives to date taken by the Equality Authority include: an anti-racism in the workplace week, organised jointly by IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation, the ICTU and the Equality Authority, which took place from 6 to 10 November 2000; preparation of a range of publications and videos to help people understand the equality legislation and the institutions established by the legislation &ndash; these are available in a range of formats and languages to ensure accessibility; advancing work in the preparation of codes of practice covering sexual harassment and harassment, access to public houses, hotels and restaurants and the operation of golf club membership &ndash; those are being prepared in consultation with all the relevant interests; preparing a programme of equality reviews and action plans to be funded under the national development plan; preparation of an anti-discrimination equality pack for the Irish Traveller movement; and an initiative as part of the quality customer service approach within the strategic management initiative of the Government. This has involved the preparation of a support pack to assist quality customer services officers to develop an equality dimension to their customer service action plans.</P>

      <P>A case was taken against Ryanair recently, which was found to be in breach of the Act, for which a fine of £8,000 was imposed. It appears ageism is a problem, given that ground is the second highest category on which cases are taken under the employment equality legislation. Has the Government any further proposals to address the problem of ageism and are any campaigns proposed in this area?</P>
      <P>Why is the Government not supporting the work of the authority by introducing a disabilities Bill and a constitutional amendment on disability, a matter that was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>The campaign was due to be launched this week by the Minister and the chair<Col N="1281" /> man, Joe McDonagh, but as the chairman was out of the country the launch will take place next week. A total of £4.5 million over a three year period has been allocated for it.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the disabilities Bill in my reply to the previous question. The position is that anti-discrimination measures are in place. In preparing the disabilities Bill and perhaps in light of the experience of cases that come before the Equality Authority, issues may arise which we hope to develop as work on the disabilities Bill progresses. It is important the disabilities Bill, when published, will cover as much as possible in that regard.</P>
      <P>A reply to a later question deals with the number of case referrals on the age ground, which I can check, but it is due to be dealt with later.</P>
      <P>In the case brought against Ryanair, the Equality Authority, the complainant, was awarded £8,000 as compensation for the effective discrimination under sections 6(1) and 6(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Employment Equality Act. An equality officer found that Ryanair discriminated on the ground of age in a job advertisement for a director of regulatory affairs stating, &ldquo;We need a young and dynamic professional&rdquo;, implying that the ideal candidate would be young and dynamic. The advertisement was published in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 25 February.</P>
      <P>The Equality Authority took the case in its own right on the grounds that the advertisement contravened the protection from discrimination provided for on the age ground under the Employment Equality Act. In addition to the compensation awarded, Ryanair was ordered to take a specific course of action, including a comprehensive review of its equal opportunities policies to ensure its policies are fully compliant with equality legislation, equality proofing of recruitment and selection guidelines and the publication of a statement of equal size and prominence to the offending advertisement, making a clear commitment to equal opportunities.</P>
      <P>Case law will make the difference, irrespective of whether we are dealing with the age ground, the disability ground or any of the other grounds. We have witnessed that dating back to the 1970s in regard to the Employment Equality Agency.</P>

      <Quest>the reason video equipment is in place in only 11 Garda stations when in early August 1999 he stated that by February 2001 video recording equipment would be in operation in 200 stations across the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I have replied to questions on this matter on a number of occasions previously, most recently on 7 February 2001. The position is that the Garda authorities have indicated that their requirements will be met by the installation of audio-video equipment in approximately 220 interview rooms. The number of Garda stations involved will be in the region of 150. Interview rooms in all the relevant stations have to be refurbished to cater for the new facilities. A substantial amount of work has already been undertaken on this operation.</P>
      <P>Tenders were received last October for the supply of the specialised recording equipment. As I explained on previous occasions, completion of the evaluation of the tenders and placing a contract with a supplier was delayed due to problems encountered by the Garda authorities with the equipment submitted by suppliers during the evaluation process. In the circumstances, I expect that delivery and installation of the equipment in the remaining selected stations will commence in April and be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I am happy real progress is being made in this matter. I am hopeful the stations will be fitted out by the end of the year. <Col N="1283" /> That is as far as I can put it. There were difficulties regarding the equipment. Work must be done on the rooms in question. There are the matters of sound proofing, lighting, satisfactory recordings and videos. I am hopeful the job will be done by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>There was a timeframe for it, which was not met. I was disappointed about that because of the tendering process and the difficulties that arose. I can say what the position is now, but not what it will be by 1 June or end June. At least 39 rooms have been fitted out, work is 98% completed in another 28 rooms and 75% completed in another 15 rooms, and the work in the remainder is less advanced. We have made significant progress in recent months.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the delays in processing applications for Irish citizenship; the reason for these delays; and the plans he has to provide a more efficient service.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6060/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The lengthy processing times for citizenship applications reflect, in common with most other immigration related services provided by the immigration and citizenship division of my Department, the large increase in the number of applications in recent years. Last year, 1,004 applications for naturalisation were received, an increase of 36% on the 1999 figure of 739 and 190% on the 1996 figure of 347. The number of applications for post-nuptial citizenship has remained constant over the past two <Col N="1285" /> years &ndash; 420 per year approximately &ndash; but represents an increase of 64% on the figure for 1996, which was 256. In addition, my Department is responsible for finalising about 600 applications for post-nuptial citizenship from persons resident outside the State.</P>
      <P>Another factor in the delay in processing citizenship applications is that a significant number of such applications are either incorrectly completed or incomplete despite comprehensive written instructions being included with application forms and the availability of a help line in my Department. It is estimated by officials in my Department that more than 80% of applications fall into this category. This generates vast amounts of correspondence which requires resources which might otherwise be involved in finalising correct applications.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to the immigration and citizenship division of my Department as part of the overall resource package underpinning the Government's immigration and asylum strategy. While most of those resources are being dedicated to that strategy, provision was also made in the package for the allocation of staff who are dedicated exclusively to the processing of citizenship applications. The intention is to reduce the processing time of applications through a combination of quicker throughput of applications and the implementation, where possible, of streamlined procedures. Most of the staff are now in place and, when the remainder come on stream, the staff engaged full-time in the processing of citizenship applications will have doubled from nine to 18. Notwithstanding the arrival of many of the staff in question and the need for training, etc, the average processing time for naturalisation applications has already been reduced from two and a half years to two years. As further new staff come on stream and existing staff become more familiar with the legislative provisions and operational procedures, the intention is that further reductions in processing times will be achieved.</P>
      <P>In seeking to expedite applications, I am conscious that the granting of Irish citizenship is an honour and that applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are suitably qualified. There is, therefore, a limit to the reduction in the processing time that is possible without affecting the integrity of the citizenship process itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be misleading the House in terms of his comments about reducing the time for processing applications to two years. On 17 May 2000, he told me in a reply that the length of time taken to finalise an application for naturalisation was approximately two years. One of the Minister's predecessors, former Deputy Ray Burke, during the passports for sale scandal was able to process passport applications in a matter of weeks. Naturalisation was a rapid <Col N="1286" /> process at that time, but there may have been particular reasons for it.</P>

It is wrong that people are left in limbo for years after their applications have been made. Does the Minister accept that position indicates that incompetence and inefficiency are the hallmarks of his Department during his watch? If it cannot deal with naturalisation applications within a reasonable time, the Minister has questions to answer in relation to his administration.</P>

      <P>I abolished the scheme and the Department is now dealing with naturalisation applications from people who have been in the country for five years. I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that it is taking longer than one would wish. As I outlined, the number of such applications increased by approximately 35% between 1999 and 2000. The same number of staff had to deal with an increased number of applications and this is why the delay increased to two and a half years. Following an increase in staff numbers, it has been reduced to two years. While the new staff are on a learning curve, it is anticipated that they will be familiar with their new surroundings and the legislation in the near future. This will also apply to the additional staff and this should help to reduce the waiting period. The increase of 2% in the number of post-nuptial applications <Col N="1287" /> was not as substantial. The level of applications has been constant for some years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Given that the Minister indicated an 80% failure rate in the filling out of applications forms, does he accept there is a deficiency in the form or the explanatory note or both?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that one clerk examining the applications as they arrive could assess immediately whether they had been correctly completed? Does he further accept that all that is necessary thereafter is a Garda report and a check on the position in relation to work permits and tax affairs? Does the Minister agree that all this should take a couple of months at most? The current position is ridiculous. That the Minister is allowing these delays to continue is typical of the Government's approach, which is hallmarked by inefficiency and incompetence.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that Deputy O'Keeffe has blunderbussed into my area of activity with a remark of that kind, but I can assure him that his comments are totally unfounded. In this matter there is a certain procedure involved and it must be followed. If I may explain it briefly, the documents submitted with each application include the passport, birth certificate, etc., and these of course are all examined, together with the application form, and they are verified. At that point a report regarding the individual's circumstances is sought from the Garda Síochána. Normally the gardaí conduct an interview with the individual to obtain this information. Then there are inquiries regarding the individual's work permit, tax affairs, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only then, when all of that information is gathered, which, of necessity, will take some time, that the application is submitted to me for a decision.</P>
      <P>The fact that there are a high number of applications at present, coupled with the fact that we had a low number of staff, did lead to delays. I accept what Deputy O'Keeffe is saying, that the delay is unacceptable and should be eliminated. We have increased the staff from nine to 15, and shortly the staff will be increased to 18. As a result I hope the Department will process this matter more speedily in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, of course, remind Deputy O'Keeffe that the recent phenomenon of immigration and the application for asylum clearly take up a considerable amount of resources and staff. However, I am mindful of the fact that there are people who are left waiting for too long and it is <Col N="1288" /> also my objective, as I know it is Deputy O'Keeffe's, to shorten that period by as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Non-EEA nationals who are legally employed in the State may be joined by non-visa required non-EEA family members immediately, provided they are in a position to support them without access to public funds. A majority of the non-EEA nationals to whom work permits were issued last year come within the non-visa required category. Accordingly, if the family members of the persons referred to by the Deputies are non-visa required nationals, then no waiting period applies to their joining them here.</P>
      <P>The position in respect of non-EEA nationals who are legally employed in the State and who wish to be joined here by visa required family members is that the worker in question must have been in the State for a period of 12 months and have the expectation of remaining here for at least a similar period before he or she can be joined here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I set out in my response to Question No. 373 of 12 December 2000, the require<Col N="1289" /> ment that a non-EEA national be in employment for 12 months before he or she can be joined by visa required family members was reduced by me to three months in July 2000, in respect of certain categories of highly sought after skilled workers. The categories in question are participants in the new streamlined working visa scheme who include IT and telecommunications professionals, construction professionals and nurses, doctors, including temporary registered doctors and persons legally employed in other high skill areas on a case by case basis and with particular regard to any advice provided by relevant State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>If the family members of the persons referred to in the Deputies' questions are visa required, they would therefore benefit from this relaxation. Information regarding this change in practice has been widely circulated since its introduction by me last summer but if the Deputies have any particular case in mind where a person has been unable to avail of the new arrangements, I would be happy to have inquiries made on the person's behalf. I will of course also continue to deal sympathetically with individual cases where exceptional humanitarian circumstances apply.</P>
    <P>While I fully intend to keep this matter under ongoing review, in consultation with my Government colleagues as appropriate, I am not satisfied that a further change in procedures is warranted at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When a married person who applied for and obtained a visa, who is coming here lawfully and who is being employed in the State as a doctor or nurse in one of the hospitals, comes here to take up a position which we badly require filled, would the Minister accept that it is reasonable that he or she be accompanied by his or her spouse and children? Could he explain what public policy thinking lies behind maintaining a position where such people cannot be accompanied by their spouses and children when they first come here, and why there is a waiting period, which used be 12 months but is now three months, before they can be joined by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined how the procedure has been relaxed in respect of certain categories of workers. That was a response to the labour market. I outlined that such people may apply to have their spouses and family join them after three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty, I suppose, is that one cannot tell whether, for example, an individual coming into the State will prove to be unsuitable for the position which existed for him or her. Therefore three months was deemed to be an adequate period within which a judgment could be made in that respect. Clearly the objective of the exercise is to ensure in so far as possible that the person concerned would not become a burden on the State. Where a person has a humanitarian ground for remaining in the State, I can assure the Deputy <Col N="1290" /> and the House that every possible sympathetic consideration is given.</P>
    <P>In regard to other categories of workers, the rule, as I stated, is that the person must be working in the State for a period of 12 months or more. This has been the practice in the State for many years and there are also good policy grounds for that. I understand that in this respect Ireland is no different than other EU member states.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate to the House, in the context, first, of doctors and nurses as these are the workers to whom the questions relate, whether, three months after such workers have taken up a position, they can be joined by their spouses and children or whether it is only after three months that an application can be made? If the latter is the case, what is the additional timeframe involved in the consideration and granting of such an application?</P>
      <P>If it is permissible for a doctor from Canada or Australia, taking up a position in one of the major hospitals, to be accompanied the day he or she arrives in Ireland by his or her spouse, would the Minister acknowledge that there is no particular reason a qualified doctor from India or Pakistan taking up a similar position should not be accompanied the day he or she arrives by his or her spouse also?</P>
      <P>Where visas are properly obtained and work permits properly given in a broad range of other areas in the economy, in which we are becoming increasingly dependent on jobs being filled by non-EU workers who require visas, would the Minister accept that it is a short-sighted policy to disallow those workers to bring their spouses and children with them? When they are coming here to take up existing jobs, for which they have been certified and for which work permits have been granted, would he accept that it is short-sighted?</P>

      <P>The requirement is that a non-EEA national must have been in employment for 12 months in a normal case, and for three months in the three categories of cases I mentioned, before he or she can be joined by family members who require visas.</P>
      <P>In the case of doctors, there has been a long standing policy position in the State whereby non-EEA doctors can receive temporary registration with the Medical Council in order to take up employment in Ireland. In recent years we introduced a more flexible means of facilitating these doctors from an immigration point of view. We have recently improved further upon those arrangements and it is my intention to write to the Irish Medical Organisation and other interested parties with full details in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The category of nurses is covered under the new fast-track working visa authorisation scheme to which I referred. The scheme enables a person to obtain a working authorisation for two years from an Irish Embassy. No further permits are <Col N="1291" /> required. It also incorporates a facility to enable persons not immediately eligible for full registration with An Bord Altranais to seek temporary registration for three months. If the authorities are satisfied with the person's skills, he or she can obtain a work visa for up to two years at a time. The schemes for doctors and nurses work well, but I am not so foolish as to believe everything the Department and I do is perfect. We are in consultation with the Minister for Health and Children to determine if the schemes can be improved upon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter touched upon an important matter when he asked if other areas in the labour market are being addressed and there should be greater streamlining. That is reason I have stated that there will be a new immigration and residence Bill to replace the quaintly named Aliens Act, 1935.</P>

      <P>We are developing a framework, studying international legislation and best practice in the field of immigration and examining an internal review of practices within the immigration division of the Department in order that we can put in place comprehensive legislation dealing with immigration. We have established an immigration advisory committee on which the social partners and relevant Departments are represented and which will advise on labour migration issues. We are also developing a comprehensive policy which will be reflected in the new legislation.</P>
      <P>Innovative measures have been introduced. An effort has been made to streamline the work permit system. Last year we issued approximately 20,000 visas to those holding work permits, an amazing increase. We will continue to improve immigration procedures which have been streamlined. Immigration, as opposed to emigration, is a new phenomenon in Irish society in respect of which the legislative tools were insufficient. When I took office, it was, to a large extent, a greenfield site.</P>

      <P>On the right of spouses to join workers in Ireland, is there a requirement for a specific contract of employment to be in place, even after the three month period, for this category of worker? Is the Minister aware that, in the health area, because of the rules of Comhairle na <Col N="1292" /> nOspidéal, hospitals can only offer much needed non-consultant hospital doctors six month contracts which often preclude their spouses joining them? Does he accept that, from a humanitarian and human justice and rights perspective, it is unacceptable to ask an Indian, Pakistani or Sudanese doctor to work in the hospital system while depriving him or her of the right to bring his or her spouse?</P>

I have been in correspondence with his Department during the years and, regrettably, have found it to be inflexible. I can present the Minister with the correspondence and discuss with him the situation of doctors who sought to reside in my constituency. Does he appreciate that the health service is under severe strain and that the shortage of nurses and doctors means it is heavily dependent on non-European nationals to provide a service in hospitals? Will he be in a position to remedy this? It is an outrage to expect a doctor or nurse to work for 12 weeks without their spouses being here.</P>

      <P>As today is Family Friendly Workplace Day, this might be an appropriate time for the Minister to re-examine the matter. Irish nurses and doctors have travelled to the Middle East, Canada and the United States for many decades. To the best of my knowledge, they have always been able to bring their spouses and families with them. I have benefited from being able to travel to Canada with my husband on a one year stint and had a child there. We are being harder on those who come here than other countries were on us when we needed to emigrate to find work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the latter assertion. I have responded effectively and efficiently to this situation. I have outlined the new procedures in the case of certain categories of worker and how they are entitled to have their spouses and families join them after three months. If individuals were to lose their jobs within the three month period, they would not be in a position to support their wives and families. It would be unfair if they were allowed come to the State with their wives and families and subsequently find themselves in that situation. I have struck the most reasonable balance I can in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked if it is inhumane to ask a person to work in this country without having his or her spouse and family with him or her. I agree that it is difficult for such people.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is an inordinate amount of time for this matter to be under discussion? Does he further accept that it was never intended by the House that the Offences Against the State Act would be a permanent statutory measure? Does he also accept that the Special Criminal Court is being used in a way that was not envisaged when the legislation was enacted? One of the core requirements of the Good Friday Agreement is a return to normality in legal matters and the administration of justice. Does the Minister agree that the continued use of special powers in the Offences Against the State Act in this jurisdiction indicates a lack of normality? Does he accept that removing the special powers in the Offences Against the State Act from the Statute Book would be a good indication of a return to normal, to non-emergency legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it was never the intention of the House to have the Offences Against the State Acts in place for a protracted period. History, however, explains the reasons, since the introduction of the first Act, the legislation has been in place for so long. The threat to the peace process and the people of this island led to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. It gave me no pleasure to introduce it in the House. Its powers have been described as draconian. Resolutions are brought before the House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enable it to decide whether those powers should remain in force for the following 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court has been utilised for purposes which could not have been foreseen <Col N="1294" /> when it was originally established. It is often used because a view is formed that the administration of justice cannot be effectively secured in another court, for a example, a court with a jury. The committee dealing with the review of the Offences Against the State Acts has a very formidable and complex task to perform. It would be quite wrong of me to interfere or to ask it to expedite its report as I am acutely aware of the difficulties and enormity of the task it faces. I hope the report will be available in the not too distant future when we will have the opportunity of discussing this very important provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long standing policy not to comment in detail on the sentence management of any individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception in this case. However, this prisoner has received a small number of accompanied temporary releases. In addition, I recently approved a sentence management programme, recommended by the Sentence Review Group, which includes short periods of temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained to the House on several occasions recently that temporary release or parole is a feature of prison systems world wide and it is an important vehicle for reintegrating offenders into the community in a planned and <Col N="1295" /> controlled way. There is, undoubtedly, a significant element of risk in this which requires careful consideration and the paramount concern is the safety of the public. However, it fall on me as Minister to strike a balance between sometimes conflicting considerations, such as the rehabilitation of the offender and his reintegration into the community and any risk which a particular release might pose.</P>
    <P>In making individual decisions on temporary release, particularly in cases involving the death of a victim or other serious offences, the possible effect on victims or their families is an extremely important consideration. To address these concerns conditions can be imposed on temporary releases in relation to where the offender may go. Such conditions are attached expressly in view of the distress that encountering an offender may cause. In this case a prohibition on travel to the area where the victim's family resides has applied and will continue to apply in view of the strong concerns expressed to me. The case will remain under regular review and progress will be closely monitored. It is my intention to continue a programme of temporary release in respect of this prisoner, subject to ongoing review and continued good behaviour.</P>
    <P>Where the victim of a serious crime, or their family, inform my Department or the Irish Prison Service that they wish to be notified prior to such transfers or temporary releases or where an early release might pose potential difficulties for a victim, such as, for example, where a serious offender is likely to come into contact with his or her victim in the community, efforts to advise the victim or the family are made through the Garda.</P>
    <P>In this instance, I am fully aware of the concerns of the family of the victim. I have spoken to the victim's father and he has also spoken with an official in my Department. I have undertaken to inform him of significant changes in the administration of the sentence of the offender which will include notice of temporary release programmes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the family of the young girl viciously murdered by the prisoner concerned has been caused considerable distress not only by his temporary release but by the fact that they received no notice of his temporary release? Will he indicate on how many occasions the prisoner has been on temporary release and the number of occasions on which the family were given prior notice of his release? Will he also indicate whether the temporary release now being availed of by this prisoner is leading to his ultimate early release and when that is likely to happen?</P>

      <P>The Sentence Review Group operates on the same general lines as parole boards in other jurisdictions and advises Ministers regarding long-term prisoners. Its personnel comprises people with long experience working <Col N="1296" /> with ex-prisoners and their families. This matter would have been considered by that group.</P>
      <P>The Sentence Review Group recommends a programme of activity which will ultimately lead to the release, on a temporary basis, of the individual concerned. Such a person, in the case of an indeterminate sentence would remain within the remit of the authorities or, in the case of a determinant sentence until that sentence expired. I do not have plans to publish the names and addresses of people granted temporary release for very obvious reasons. However, serious consideration must also be given to the sensitivities and concerns of the victims of crime in the treatment of offenders. These sensitivities are taken into account when considering offenders for transfer to open centres, periods of temporary release or early release. I would very much regret incidents where people's sensitivities are trampled upon but I can assure Deputy Shatter that the authorities do their utmost to respond to such sensitivities.</P>

      <P>In relation to this prisoner, who was convicted for murder, sentenced to life imprisonment and has served in the region of nine years, the arrangements in place which are part of the rehabilitative process for the prisoner are not of a nature that would require them to be communicated to the victim's family. These arrangements at all times take into account the effect such a release can have on the community and on the family of the victim. Specifically, the prisoner is allowed temporary release under supervision to attend a work training programme. He is not allowed, during a period of temporary release, to be anywhere in the vicinity of the place where the offence concerned took place or in the region of which the family of the victim resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisoner has not breached any of the terms <Col N="1297" /> of his temporary release. The sentence review group has reviewed the case twice to date and is satisfied with the progress of the prisoner in prison. Advice from all other authorities is taken into account.</P>
    <P>If a significant change were to be contemplated in the sentence management arrangements for this prisoner that would impact on the victim's family &ndash; I give this undertaking to Deputies Shatter and Enright &ndash; these will certainly be communicated to the victim's family.</P>

      <P>I emphasise again the need for the Minister to spell out the details of the plan he has developed to deal with the current crisis. I have listed some of the questions I would like addressed. A key question is how the movement of animals and people is to be controlled in the event of an outbreak. What additional role does the Minister see for the media in the event of an outbreak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer information needs to be increased. <Col N="1298" /> The safety of the food supply is not an issue and this message needs to be reinforced. It is also important, however, to address the possibility of a shortage of animal foods should an outbreak occur.</P>
    <P>If animals must be destroyed are the conditions and the location of the destruction programme defined? How will the infected carcases be disposed of? Are there plans in place for reviewing the conditions of pasteurisation of milk? The standard procedure for pasteurisation is not adequate to destroy the virus. It should be emphasised again that the measures introduced to prevent spread of the disease should have no safety implications. Does the Minister consider it necessary to review the pasteurisation conditions? Has the food processing industry been up-dated in relation to the need for processing of vulnerable foods? Higher temperatures than are currently used may be required to treat some products.</P>
    <P>What programme will be implemented to ensure that the farm on which the infected animals were found is adequately disinfected? It is important that people are informed of the reasons for the need to slaughter animals. Questions have been asked about the merits of vaccination, for example. Does the Minister consider that such a course of action should be considered? If not, the reasons should be provided.</P>
    <P>A number of questions have been raised about the need to slaughter animals. On one hand it has been emphasised that the animals do not necessarily die from the disease, that the disease is debilitating but not life threatening for the majority of animals. Why are they being slaughtered when they pose no health threat and could recover? Addressing questions such as these would give the consumer a perspective on the implications of the disease for the economy.</P>
    <P>Of the concerns I have raised today, the immediate concern relates to the sheep that may have been infected which were found in an abattoir in Roscommon and which may have come from a farm in Northern Ireland. Was the abattoir to which the animals were delivered licensed? If so, what are the conditions of the licence and were there breaches of those conditions? Who authorised the slaughter of the animals?</P>
    <P>I seek information again on the regulation of the meat industry. Recent events in relation to specified risk material, SRM, in abattoirs gave serious cause for concern. As part of the review arising from present events, perhaps the Minister will address the overall regulation of the meat industry again.</P>
    <P>The Minister must now put together a comprehensive package of measures to restore confidence in our ability to contain the disease and that message should be marketed in a much more pro-active way.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The severe consequences that would follow for farming communities, rural communities and tens of thousands of workers who must not be forgotten in this equation require an immediate preventative and remedial response in the event that there may be an unfortunate outbreak in the State. A much more far-reaching response is needed in the form of an analysis of agricultural practices in modern times and the manner of the trade in animals and food.</P>
      <P>Everyone hopes there will not be an outbreak here but the Government's response in the first week has been lacking, amounting even to complacency. The policy has been one of hope rather than immediately swinging into action to put in place the measures to ensure that animals here did not become infected. Much anecdotal evidence has been given.</P>
      <P>The Minister said today that he put a temporary ban on the imports of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer on 21 February. It was not, however, until 26 February that horses were banned from coming into the country, as the Minister told me yesterday in a reply to a parliamentary question, a full five days after the ban on cattle and sheep. Horses were coming here, probably from all over England, to stud farms and there should be an explanation as to why that was allowed. It was a risk that should not have been taken.</P>
      <P>Serious questions will arise for meat processors as a result of this. One case has been accidentally highlighted. Sections of this industry have created substantial problems for the country and its taxpayers in the past, and the spotlight must be turned on their practices. I am astounded that the Government and the main spokesperson for Fine Gael did not mention the wider question that should arise in this debate, practices and procedures in present-day agriculture.</P>
      <P>Farming has become extremely intensive, largescale and globalised. In Britain ten years ago there were 233,000 farms. In the short space of ten years that number has decreased by 25%, to 168,000. Some 750,000,000 broiler chickens are reared and killed each year in Britain &ndash; I could not get similar figures for Ireland &ndash; 98% of them in the intensive factory farms. In the last week of it's life, each bird spends its time on a space the size of an A4 sheet of paper.</P>
      <P>Sows and pigs are reared in excruciatingly confined conditions, for example, with endless rows of sows chained side by side. Apart from the cruelty issue, this is a recipe for disaster as these are precisely the conditions in which disease can spread like wildfire. Veterinary officers in Britain have spoken about the cramped conditions and appalling hygiene in Northumberland where this infection came to public attention. Today the problem is foot and mouth disease, but in the past few years it was BSE which was the result of feeding meat to vegetarian creatures, an inversion of natural processes. E-coli, salmonella and perhaps diseases unknown here can also result down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Global capitalism treats animals as an inanimate commodity, as if they were trading in iron and steel, which they are not. Animals are sentient beings which, like human beings, have evolved over millions of years. They developed in specific eco-systems which determined their characteristics, diet, etc., and developed resistance to diseases and organisms which were dangerous to them. However, because of intense capitalistic methods of production their environment has been radically changed over a few decades. Their diet and conditions have been changed and it is clear that in these new conditions disease can spread radically and much more rapidly than in more natural conditions. This point must be taken on board.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years the distances animals and food travel have increased enormously. The live trade has been intensively increased with animals exported throughout the world. Deputy Dukes and the Government spokesperson will perhaps snort in derision at these points, but it would be absolutely insane not to consider them in the future development of agriculture. I am not saying we should go back to feudal localism, which is not possible. However, we can put in place a system which is much more localised in terms of where animals go, how food is processed and where food is marketed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has called for calm and a lack of hysteria in regard to this matter but a case of foot and mouth disease has been confirmed two miles from the Border. However, this is not the most significant aspect of this problem. Rather it is that this farm was used as a base for the importation of lambs from Britain <i>via</i> Northern Ireland. These lambs were killed in factories here and the meat was exported as Irish lamb. This has serious consequences.</P>
      <P>The consignment in question consisted of 291 lambs which were shipped from Carlisle to Northern Ireland. However, only 271 were accredited as arriving in Northern Ireland, while 248 were killed in Athleague. We are told that two lambs died during transportation. The 22 lambs which remained on the farm in Northern Ireland were subsequently destroyed. What happened to the other 22 lambs? This has not been explained by anyone.</P>
      <P>It is now established that the 248 lambs killed in the Kepak factory in Athleague were booked in under a fictitious name. If the practice of importing lambs from England to Northern Ireland and transporting them to factories in the South was legal, why was it necessary to book them in under a false name? More importantly, why was this tolerated by the factory staff when everybody knew that the lambs had come from Northern Ireland and had been sourced in England? As Irish sheep are not tagged and British sheep are tagged, why was it not noticed that the tags were removed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> This is not an isolated case. The transportation of sheep from Britain to Ireland <i>via</i> Northern Ireland has been widespread for at least two years. When prices got depressed in Britain because of BSE it became profitable to engage in this practice. The people who engage in this practice, with the co-operation of factory-owners &ndash; there are more factories involved than the one in Athleague &ndash; and the obvious blind eye the Department has turned to this problem has struck a serious blow to food exports. These people should have the most severe penalties possible imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Even if foot and mouth disease never became a problem in the South, the exposure of this sham whereby Irish factories kill British sheep and export the meat as Irish lamb will do untold damage to our export market and good name. Factories have used this system to depress the price here. They tell farmers they have too much lamb and cannot take their animals. Farmers then try to get rid of their stock and the price falls.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how this practice was allowed to continue even though Department officials were made aware of it more than one year ago? I worked in the livestock mart industry for 23 years and know a good deal about what goes on in marts. One year ago a midlands mart supplied information and evidence to the Garda and Department officials. Over a long period a large number of cheques presented for the purchase of livestock at the mart were drawn on the Athleague factory and other factories. This case involves the use of eight fictitious names up to 100 times over a certain period. The directors of the mart supplied the information to the Garda and Department officials.</P>

      <P>Not since May 1970 when what became known as the arms crisis burst upon us can I recall such a sense of national crisis arising out of one episode as there is today, particularly with the confirmation of a case of foot and mouth disease almost on the Border in County Armagh and at a time when there have been northerly winds for several days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> I am afraid that what we are seeing is the failure of the regulatory authority. We have seen it many times during the past 15 years in the beef trade and we are seeing it again. The job of the Minister and Department is to stop this disease coming into the country; it is not, as they give the impression, to control it when it is here. If there is one single confirmed case of this disease in the Republic the consequences will be absolutely enormous not only for agriculture, farmers or those involved in agri-business but for the entire community and economy.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are faced with this awful prospect it is extraordinary that we have apparently no laboratory to test these animals or any part of their carcass. All the samples have to go to a laboratory in Purbright in Surrey, and apparently it takes four days to get a result. This is not good enough. Agriculture and, in particular, the rearing of animals is about ten times more important to our economy than it is to the British economy. I cannot understand why we do not have facilities to test for this disease. This does not apply only to this disease. I recall some years ago when there was an investigation into a fraud in export refunds, which is pretty well endemic in the beef industry, and it was necessary to try to distinguish whether intervention beef was heifer or steer beef. We were told by the Minister that the test could not be done here and would have to be done abroad. It did not seem to be a particularly difficult test.<i></i>The other day I happened to read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for last year on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, in a different context but I could not help being reminded of it this morning. It lists a whole range of failures in the regulatory system going back to 1983 where the Department still had not coped with or recovered moneys due to it as a result of fraud in export refunds. That is 18 years ago. The laid back, lackadaisical approach to so much of what happens in the agriculture sphere, particularly in the sphere relating to animals, is amazing and apparently it has been acceptable here for a very long time. I tried to call a halt to it with rather limited success. The time has come, even if it is too late to prevent this disaster, to call a halt to it.</P>
    <P>What is striking in this debate is the apparent uncertainty about what happened, or might have happened, in Athleague, County Roscommon, last week. Why is there any uncertainty as to what happened in Athleague last week with these imported sheep or lambs? There was a departmental vet there and he inspected them before they were slaughtered. The place is coming down with officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, agricultural officers and agricultural inspectors. Why cannot they relay to the Minister and he to this House and to the public exactly what happened? If these were British sheep, as appears to have been the case, they either had tags on them or their ears would show the result of the tags having been <Col N="1303" /> removed from the ears. To say there is uncertainty about it is not good enough. It reminds me of what happened in Rathkeale in 1990 and 1991 where vets and officials of the Department were aware of what was going on but did nothing to stop it. When will people learn? We have only to look at the damage that has been done to this country by a lack of enforcement of the law and of the regulations. There was a willingness to turn a blind eye so often, for which the entire economy and all our people will pay a very high price.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a list of things that have happened over the last week or so. I have to confess it does not make impressive reading. It was written in an almost apologetic tone as if the Minister and the Department were apologising for taking certain steps and assuring people that only the minimum would be done. The consequences of this are so serious that the Minister and the Department need not apologise for anything they do to prevent this scourge entering the country. Given that the marts have been closed, or all but a few who apparently have continued to trade notwithstanding the Minister's decision, there would be a certain logic in closing meat factories except for the purposes of destruction. I understand that is under consideration. I would like to hear from the Minister or Minister of State whether it will be done. To have allowed horses to come into this country in the past week, with the apparent permission of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, was entirely wrong. For the most part those animals came from Britain which already had foot and mouth disease. The Tánaiste described this today as a potential catastrophe for this country. She is correct in that. It is hard to exaggerate what the consequences will be if a case is confirmed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to lose his inhibitions now in terms of putting in controls and enforcing those controls. Even if those controls cause great inconvenience to many people, and many who have nothing to do with farming or the agricultural industry, they should be brought in and enforced if they would help to prevent this catastrophe coming upon us. It is hard to say it has not come upon us when there is a confirmed case on land within a mile or so of our own Border.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be confident that everything that could have been done was done. I have a shed full of cattle, the same of most other farmer Members. As this week passed my confidence began to ebb particularly when the Minister, Deputy Walsh, told the House there was an exclusion order on the Border and that he was not aware, although he had been briefed, what public road went through it. I lost all confidence in him on that occasion. How is it that he did not know what highway was running through an exclusion area at the Border? That is the first thing he would have to be told. Many eyebrows <Col N="1304" /> were raised both in the House and outside on hearing that statement.</P>
      <P>I recall saying in the House on Wednesday or Thursday last that the Government was acting on hope more than anything else. Seven days had passed before there was a concerted effort. Given all the stories I have heard from my constituents on the phone today I do not see that there is any concerted effort or co-ordination.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday the Department grounded the agricultural officers and everybody agreed with that. They are the people who run the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and are the front line troops. Several of them had not been given any responsibility until today. What did most of them do for the week? They are the people who know how to do things. It is not that they did not want to do it, but there was nobody to tell them. That is the first battalion. I had a 'phone call today from a school principal not 100 miles away from one of the areas concerned. He said there were 600 or 700 students in the school and they would like to do something. A number of schools are anxious to know what they should do but there is nobody to tell them. Given that school principals are in charge of a huge mobile group in a rural area who return to farms, even if only out of civic spirit the disinfection pads could be put in immediately. Is that not what should be done by every rural school? In that way he would not have to wait seven or eight days for this to happen. How is it that someone in the Department did not say this should have been done a week ago?</P>
      <P>The Garda and the Army are patrolling the Border which is the front line defence. Has any instruction issued to the Garda inland, the superintendents, the chief superintendents, inspectors and sergeants? What is their role in this excluding the Border area since it is all over the place? One does not have to go far from where I live in Mountbellew to get to Kepak Athleague which is only down the road. What has the Garda been asked to do and what level of co-ordination is involved? My understanding is that they received no instructions whatsoever. Some members are involved along the Border but there is no co-ordination internally.</P>
      <P>There should be an immediate television advertisement showing what foot and mouth disease entails. The lotto numbers are shown on television several times a week so there is no reason for not having an advertisement on foot and mouth disease. As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, this is the biggest crisis we have faced for a long time and it should be treated as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of how the sheep came into the country does not apply to just a factory in Athleague but to the whole of Ireland. Everyone in this House knows that we have a common market policy with Northern Ireland, therefore there is no need for certification. However, this is not the case in relation to sheep coming from Scotland, England, Wales or any other European country. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister <Col N="1305" /> for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on 2 February 2000 following a huge furore over sheep imports. Lorries with unidentified sheep were coming in during the dead of night and no one knew where they came from, where they were going or who was profiting from it. Part of the reply from the Minister, Deputy Walsh, reads as follows:</P>
    <P>However, under EU legislation sheep coming from other member states must be accompanied by EU veterinary certification and be assigned to a particular holding/ slaughterhouse. A separate certificate applies to each of three categories, i.e., sheep for breeding, sheep for fattening and sheep for slaughter. Details of each consignment of animals imported are required to be sent in advance to the local Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office in the county of destination through the EU Animal Notification System.</P>
    <P>The first question is did this notification come through in the last two years? Did it come through in this case? Is there certification to prove the sheep came here? If the sheep did not have ear tags, where did they go? This is happening all over the country. Someone has done a huge disservice to the people of Ireland if this type of thing is happening, which I believe is the case. There must be answers to these questions which I presume we will receive tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Just before last Christmas, every householder in the country received candles through the post from the millennium committee, which was a nice idea. Given the great cloud which is now hanging over us, surely in this day and age it should be possible to write to everyone in the country on this matter. There is no point talking about this next week. Why did this not happen last week? I certainly did not get a letter today and I might not get it until next week or the week after. Given modern technology, there is no reason this cannot be done now.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 140,000 to 150,000 herd owners in the country. What is the Department doing to ensure there are disinfectant pads outside every farm gate, or does the Minister want farmers to provide this themselves? Many farmers are asking should they provide this. Is the Minister of State giving an instruction today that this should be done? That would be a huge job by any standards. The farming organisations, gardaí, agricultural officers, members of the Civil Defence and so on should be involved in trying to deal with this issue. There must be a pad outside every farmer's gate. There is no point talking about this if it will take six months. I do not know what type of fabric should be used or if the disinfectant will be available. I am asking the Minister of State will there be some form of mobilisation to carry out this requirement in the next day or two?</P>
    <P>I have many things to say and a very short time to say them. Given that the farming community <Col N="1306" /> is now almost closed down because people cannot sell any produce and that there will be no inspections for REPS and so on, will the Minister of State give an undertaking that advance payments will be made to these farmers and that they will not receive letters stating they cannot be paid because they were not down for inspection? Can I take it that the advance payment mechanism will deal with any problems with auditors and so on? That was the case previously and it should be the case again.</P>
    <P>I am receiving calls from around the country about TB and brucellosis testing. What is the official Department policy in this regard? Will these tests go ahead next week as planned or will they be stopped? </P>
    <P>If this crisis continues for a couple of weeks &ndash; I hope it will blow over but it does not look good this evening &ndash; will the Minister for State ensure that banks, building societies and so on will deal leniently with farmers who have no assets at this stage?</P>

      <P>This is the most important debate to take place in this House since I became a Member. There is no doubt the country is currently on the brink of a catastrophe. The actions taken over the coming hours and days will be absolutely crucial for the agricultural community, for workers in the food industry and for every citizen of the State.</P>
      <P>The spectre of foot and mouth disease taking hold in the country fills me with fear and apprehension. The impact on agriculture, rural life and the food industry will be devastating. Every action the State will take in the coming days will be important. No matter how small or isolated a single measure may seem, it may well prove crucial in attempting to stop the spread of this vile and virulent disease among livestock. The coming days are vital. We will get just one chance to keep the foot and mouth disease out of Ireland. Although there are very worrying signals, there is no foot and mouth disease in the State at present. We must do everything in our power to ensure we keep this disease out. Contributors to the debate made intelligent and sensible suggestions. I hope the Government will take them on board without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the current situation in relation to the Cheltenham race meeting. I am a great lover of sport and deeply regret calling for the cancellation of any sporting event. However, the situation in both Britain and Ireland is now so serious that this major event cannot be held. I urge the Government and the Irish equine industry to send this message loud and clear to the British authorities. As a TD from Kildare, I am very aware of the great dangers involved in the movement of horses and horse personnel to and from Britain. The Curragh is the centre of the Irish equine industry and is also involved in intensive sheep production. People travelling with horses to Cheltenham and returning to the Curragh will pose a huge risk to the region. This cannot be contemplated. I know <Col N="1307" /> the Irish racing fraternity has no intention of visiting such a risk on the area and is prepared to cancel their involvement given the potential consequences. The British authorities must be convinced to cancel the event until the current crisis has passed.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate sporting organisations throughout the country who have acted very responsibly in cancelling sporting events. I am aware of the inconvenience this will create in sporting calendars. However, this is in the halfpenny place compared to the crisis with which we are currently faced.</P>
    <P>Many speakers rightly highlighted the major gaps in information provided by the Government. If the Taoiseach had taken on board the call made last Tuesday by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, to establish a Cabinet co-ordinating group, these deficiencies would have been overcome. For instance, a lack of information on the Department's website has been criticised. Many farm families who do not have access to the web access the data information through RTE's Aertel service. However, there is very little in the Department's pages on Aertel relating to the foot and mouth disease. This must be rectified immediately.  </P>
    <P>Meat industry workers have suffered severe financial losses due to lay-offs caused by the BSE crisis. Will the Minister move to ensure a planning task force, comprising representatives of the trade unions, employers and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is immediately convened to draw up a contingency plan to deal with the possible employment cuts that may fall on the sector? The group formed to address the recent BSE related lay-offs should be expanded and given greater prominence to deal with what may occur in coming weeks and months.</P>
    <P>We are facing one of the gravest crises in the history of the State. No stone must be left unturned in coming days and weeks to prevent the spread of the disease, now worryingly confirmed in south County Armagh. Whatever the cost of this operation, it would be minuscule compared with the massive economic and social damage caused in the event of an outbreak here.</P>
    <P>My party has approached this debate in a constructive fashion. We have been critical of the Government's<i> ad hoc</i> response in certain areas, but this is not the time to seek political advantage. We have not sought to do so. Everyone must turn their energies and skills to the task confronting us. It is not an exaggeration to say that we are facing a national crisis.</P>
    <P>We will have only one chance to deal with this important matter. There will be a disaster if we fail. It is, therefore, vital that everybody knows what to do. In many cases this means maintaining a physical presence of gardaí and Defence Forces members at airports and ports. It is important to ensure every person entering the country passes through a disinfecting unit. All cars entering our <Col N="1308" /> ports must be similarly treated. Many company personnel have their own air transport and it is vital the Department ensures all private air strips are included in the central net.</P>
    <P>Television and local and national radio stations and the print media must be used, on an hourly basis if necessary, to ensure everybody remains focused. Nobody can or should be allowed to move without being aware of the dangers. We cannot afford to have one outbreak of the disease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to schools. We must ensure each child knows what is involved. Nobody creates conversation in households as much as children. If they are aware of the dangers and the problems everyone in the household will be so aware. Every citizen of whatever age must be involved, and must want to be involved, in ensuring the disease does not get here. Ensuring success will mean that the Celtic tiger, which has benefited many, will continue to work towards improvement in employment etc. If we lose out on this one chance, the economic gains achieved will be lost forever in the ensuing economic disaster.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow a situation to emerge where the farming community will be forgotten. As a rural Deputy, I cannot over-stress the need for those living in cities and towns to realise this. They must not do anything in coming days and weeks to endanger rural and farming communities. Those who own holiday homes and take hill walks etc., must realise that they will be unable to engage in such activities in coming weeks. They must also realise that they must protect the right of rural communities to exist. A possible tragedy must be avoided.</P>
    <P>I make an impassioned plea for the Government, Opposition and the media to work together to ensure we achieve success. If we fail, the result will be the greatest disaster to befall us in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>We are faced with what is an appalling vista, a term used by a British judge in a different connection, but one that adequately describes what will face us if a case of foot and mouth disease is confirmed. The disease is endemic in Great Britain, with 33 cases confirmed. Sadly, a case has been confirmed in south County Armagh, near the Border. A confirmation of a foot and mouth disease outbreak here would lead to an immediate ban on exports and jeopardise the livelihoods of 120,000 full and part-time farmers and 200,000 workers in the food and agri-business sectors. It would also create severe difficulties for the wider population and economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of meat factories is under consider<Col N="1309" /> ation. The issue of compensation for those workers and small farmers who would be affected needs to be considered. The industry is worth approximately £6 billion in terms of exports.</P>
    <P>A national effort across the political spectrum and the community is being made to try to ensure the disease does not take hold. We need to highlight for the public the dangers of the disease and the dire consequences if it takes hold. In debates in the Chamber this week a number of Deputies said that disinfection is largely cosmetic. While that may be technically correct, it is vitally important because it represents the public face of the reaction by the Government and the authorities to handling the threat posed by the disease. It is vitally important that the precautions taken are widely publicised and highly visible to ensure the dangers and the consequences of the disease are brought to the attention not only of rural, but urban dwellers. Local radio and newspapers must be used to help with this.</P>
    <P>I understand many of the disinfectant mats are approximately 2.5 feet in width while the normal circumference of car wheels is approximately four feet. How effective can these mats be in such circumstances? Like many others, I am dissatisfied with the security measures being taken at the Border. Will the Minister confirm that approximately 600 personnel are manning 299 Border crossings? If that is correct, it is unacceptable. The Minister should call on additional Army personnel, including the military reserve, the FCA and voluntary organisations such as the Civil Defence, all of whom would be only too willing to play their part in what may become a serious national crisis. That should be done immediately. We, as politicians, should lead by example. I hope the Minister will confirm that travel by politicians, Ministers and Ministers of State over the St. Patrick's Day weekend will be cancelled. It is vitally important that we lead by example to ensure this devastating disease is not contracted in the country.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Healy for sharing his time with me in this very important debate. What code of instructions, if any, have been circulated to Garda stations throughout the country? It is most important that members of the Garda Síochána throughout the country are circulated immediately with a code of instructions by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to combat this dreaded disease. Sensational headlines like those in a national newspaper this morning stating, &ldquo;It's Here&rdquo; do not help the situation. Everyone concerned should act responsibly. Co-operation is the name of the game and if we do not get that from the press and everybody concerned, it will have a detrimental effect on a very important industry to this country's economy.</P>

    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development seems to be satisfied with a happy-go-lucky procedure operated by certain farmers and dealers. All sheep in Great Britain <Col N="1310" /> are tagged but, apparently, when these British sheep arrive here, their tags are removed immediately. This is scandalous and it should have been corrected by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Ministers concerned long before now. Wholesale trade seems to be allowed by the Minister and the Department, which apparently turned a blind eye to the operations carried out by illegal operators. It is shocking that a lorry load of sheep bought in Carlisle in England arrived in south Armagh and that some of those sheep have arrived in the Republic. This is not acceptable as far as the Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he has the backing and full co-operation of all the farmers and farming bodies, which is necessary? It is in the interests of farmers, as well as in the interests of the public and the country, that they co-operate.</P>
    <P>Foxes, badgers, rodents etc. are carriers of the disease. What steps are being taken to curb the intrusion of rodents and foxes from south Armagh into Monaghan? Rodents and foxes travel far by night and they could be carriers of the disease.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was highly critical of the huge list of irregularities that have occurred in the meat and livestock trade over the years. He rightly highlighted in no uncertain terms that this illegal business has been going on long before now and that it should have been stamped out long ago.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister should be satisfied that they have taken all steps possible to curb the entry of the disease into this country. It was 4 p.m. this evening before a mat containing disinfectant was placed outside the main entrance to Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that most of our minds are on other matters today but, nevertheless, it is family friendly workplace day and it is important that we focus on this issue. It may not be of immediate crisis proportions as is the foot and mouth outbreak, but in terms of the long-term welfare of our society, particularly our families, it is a very important issue. It should be an issue not only on one day in the year, even though this is family friendly workplace day, but throughout the year for people at work, their employers and families.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise a number of issues under this heading. The point of raising this matter is to focus on the difficulties which arise for so many families in trying to work out their daily life in terms of the needs of the workplace and their families, their individual needs, the need to interact with each other and, in many cases, the needs of their extended families and the difficulties that causes. It causes financial difficulties in terms of the cost of housing, trying to pay mortgages, pay child care, transport and so on.</P>
      <P>One of the main areas where we can make a difference for families is by having a more flexible workplace. Although we have flexi-time and job sharing, it is by no means widespread and it does not have legal standing. Many employers would not entertain such applications in their workplace, so it is not a reality for many workers.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the proposal to give fathers the right to attend ante-natal classes and the moves to allow mothers to adjust their working hours to facilitate breast feeding, we need to do a lot more. I raised the issue of breast feeding previously in the context of the extended maternity and adoptive leave. It is very difficult for a mother in that situation to go back to work and I would welcome any measures that would help in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to focus on the need for paid parental leave. When the Parental Leave Bill was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we argued strongly for such leave to be paid. That is the only way such leave will be availed of by a very large sector of our society because people, whether the mother or the father, simply cannot afford to take the extra time off and to do without their wages. We are one of the few EU countries <Col N="1312" /> which does not pay people on parental leave. We must change that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether we can expect some changes in this area to bring us into line with our European neighbours. In countries such as Austria, France and the northern European countries, people are entitled to up to a year's parental leave. That makes a huge difference to the parents of young children. It allows a child's mother or father, or both, to spend time with him or her at a very young age and it overcomes the problem of parents having to bring small babies to costly external child care facilities. If an analysis were carried out, I do not believe it would prove very costly to provide extended paid leave as savings would be made on child care places. Extended paid leave would make family life far happier as people would not be forced to make these difficult choices when their children are very young. I appeal to the Minister to consider favourably the provision of paid parental leave and other family friendly opportunities in the workplace.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Force majeure </i>leave is available for a limited number of days per annum but many people are not aware of this facility, which should be more widely advertised. If a child is ill or has an accident, parents can avail of paid leave for a limited number of days.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go in becoming more family friendly but we now have the finances to achieve our objectives in this area and we should follow the example of our European neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy has raised this issue on the Adjournment. Today is the first Family Friendly Workplace Day. Earlier today, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, launched a new website &ndash; www.familyfriendly.ie &ndash; and an information brochure, An Introduction to Family Friendly Working Arrangements, on behalf of the national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise.</P>
      <P>Family Friendly Workplace Day, the website and the information brochure are all initiatives of the national framework committee which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support and facilitate family friendly policies in the workplace. Members of the national framework committee include IBEC, ICTU, the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Taoiseach, Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Equality Authority. Funding for the committee's work is available under the national development plan with some £4 million being allocated for the period 2000-06, £1.5 million of which covers the period 2000-02, the duration of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family friendly policies mean those policies <Col N="1313" /> which enable workers to combine employment with their family life, caring responsibilities and personal lives outside work. This includes the statutory entitlements of maternity leave &ndash; women who commence maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 are entitled to 18 weeks' paid leave and eight weeks' unpaid leave; adoptive leave &ndash; an adopting mother who commences adoptive leave on or after 8 March 2001 is entitled to 14 weeks' paid adoptive leave and eight weeks' unpaid leave; and parental leave &ndash; each natural or adoptive parent of a child is entitled to 14 weeks' unpaid parental leave until the child reaches five years of age. However, there is more to family friendly policies than mere statutory provisions. There are a number of family friendly working arrangements, outside of the statutory entitlements, such as flexi-time, part-time work, job sharing, term time, e-working, career breaks and paternity leave which can be implemented through a partnership approach in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Many workplaces already have family friendly working arrangements. Research commissioned by the Equality Authority, Investing in People &ndash; family friendly work arrangements in small and medium sized enterprises by Hugh Fisher, reveals that 53% of companies in the SME sector operate one or more family friendly working arrangements but, interestingly, many did not realise their enterprises were family friendly.</P>
    <P>The website and brochure launched today are aimed at promoting family friendly working arrangements by giving practical information and advice. The website outlines the different types of family friendly working arrangements, contains a comprehensive series of case studies, a frequently asked questions section, an inventory of family friendly publications, and a bulletin board where visitors to the website can ask questions or seek information from other subscribers. The national framework committee, in developing the website, was anxious to ensure that in addition to providing a resource it would facilitate feedback from those interested in developing and those who have already developed family friendly working arrangements. As part of the information and awareness campaign which commenced today, the committee plans a series of follow-on actions. A programme of four regional seminars is planned to run from April to June in Dundalk, Galway, Waterford and Cork. It is hoped that Family Friendly Workplace Day and the regional seminars will be the springboard for a range of new initiatives at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>The issue of family friendly workplaces is best addressed on two fronts. First, by adopting a partnership approach to achieve tailor-made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer and, second, through appropriate legislative measures. Such a partnership approach, supported by appropriate legislative measures, will ensure that further family friendly working arrangements will become available in the workplace. The Government is committed to the <Col N="1314" /> approach outlined above through its involvement in the national framework committee and through a number of initiatives being taken on the legislative front.</P>
    <P>The Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, are currently before the Dáil under the stewardship of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt. When the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 becomes law, it will provide a significant statutory right for employees to avail of 65 weeks carer's leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, provides for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and will improve the quality of part-time work. The Bill, when enacted, will ensure that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the existing body of family friendly legislation is under review. I referred earlier to the enhanced legislative measures in relation to maternity and adoptive leave which come into effect for those commencing leave on or after 8 March, following the Government's acceptance of the recommendations contained in the report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, yesterday announced a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>In summary, the new proposed legislation and the review of existing legislative measures, together with the work of the national framework committee supported by the social partners and the Equality Authority, will provide the best means of achieving the goal of making workplaces family friendly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the application of two school authorities for free school transport for pupils from Cherry Orchard who attend St. Louisa's junior and senior girls' schools in Ballyfermot. The school authorities make a very strong case that many circumstances, including the lack of free transport, limit parents' capacity to access education for their children at an early stage. Within the terms of the current scheme, these <Col N="1315" /> pupils are denied free school transport because they live just outside the two to three mile limit.</P>
      <P>The weekly transport cost to parents is £6.50 per child. In many cases, more than one child attends these schools and this places a huge expense on families living in Cherry Orchard, which I consider to be the most disadvantaged urban area in the State. There is a high level of unemployment in the area and many of these families are dependent on social welfare. As a result, a three day school-going week has become the norm in these schools.</P>
      <P>As the school authorities see it, the effect of the lack of free transport is as follows: a poor attendance rate, low achievement and late identification of special needs undermining the benefits of early childhood and primary education, ineffective use of school resources, early school leaving at primary level, lack of full participation and inclusion for all in quality education. Effective parental involvement is hampered by constraints of time and stress put on parents struggling with daily transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>The school authorities welcome plans to provide a primary school for Cherry Orchard but in the meantime ask that consideration be given to providing free transport now, ensuring children's rights to education by removing the financial barriers facing disadvantaged families. The principals of both schools are happy to provide the necessary information required for the investigation into this urgent matter. The school authorities state that they are appalled at the insensitivity and lack of interest shown by the Department of Education and Science in their concerns about this serious matter affecting the education of these marginalised and disadvantaged children. It is a two mile walk from Cherry Orchard through what they describe as a rather unfriendly environment to St. Louisa's two primary schools at the far end of Drumfinn Road. They are concerned that overstretched parents cannot pay for public transport. They survive day to day on a meagre budget and frequently keep their children out of school. They point out that the Department ought to set a precedent in their favour, especially as it is a short-term commitment until the new school is built.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for sharing his time. I raised this issue also with the Minister and the Department and I am sure that today's reply will be similar, that because it is within the two mile limit, a precedent cannot be established. That is technically correct but it is stupid for the reasons that Deputy Gregory has stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to a cost benefit analysis of making a workforce family friendly. Will the Minister make a similar analysis of two pieces of legislation, the recently passed Education Welfare Act and the Children Bill, under both of which a huge amount of money will be <Col N="1316" /> spent correcting things that have gone wrong? If we spend a small amount in getting these children to school in safety and comfort, keeping them dry when it is raining, we will achieve much more than trying to solve the problem afterwards. It will also establish in their minds that a child goes to school every day and that coming from Cherry Orchard does not mean that you do not go to school.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Gregory and I have experience of disadvantaged communities in Dublin. This is one of the most disadvantaged. It is an example of the worst kind of housing strategy where houses are built without any facilities. They will have a school but there is no shop. Money is now being spent on community facilities. Once there were almost riots there. Will the Minister make a sensible decision? Do not have us, or those who follow us, asking for special allocation for this area's children when matters go seriously wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that on my first appearance at a Dáil Adjournment I do not have good news. I thank both Deputies Gregory and McGennis for raising this matter. It gives an opportunity to outline the circumstances of the case and the Department of Education and Science's policy on such matters.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for primary school transport children must live at least two miles from their nearest suitable national school as determined by the Department. Apart from services to special schools, the school transport scheme does not operate in the greater Dublin area. Pupils who are eligible for transport in the Dublin area are offered free passes on public bus, train or DART services.</P>
      <P>The pupils in Cherry Orchard are within two miles of their nearest suitable schools and do not qualify for free transport under the terms of the scheme. In 1991, the Department of Education considered introducing a special school transport scheme, outside the terms of the existing scheme, to give free or subsidised transport to children living in the Cherry Orchard estate to assist them in attending their local schools in Ballyfermot. This was not feasible as it was impossible to confine it to one small area and it would have resulted in similar demands on a national basis. As the pupils from the area concerned are not eligible under the terms of the scheme, it is not open to the Department of Education and Science to offer free transport or grant-aid in this case.</P>
      <P>As I am not the Minister for Education and Science I cannot make a decision, but I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State the special circumstances and the proposal for a short-term solution until the primary school is built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in her new ministry. The proper application of the National <Col N="1317" /> Monuments Acts, 1930-1994, where works proposed are at or near monuments protected under these Acts, is welcome. Why do they not apply to Dúchas and its agents at the site of the Carrowmore megalithic tombs? Why does Dúchas not have an archaeologist present under licence during the works? Who authorised this programme and from what funds are the works, which cost £50,000, being paid? When were Dúchas archaeologists made aware of these works and were they, or other archaeologists, asked for input? Will an archaeologist with knowledge of the Carrowmore passage tombs be involved in the proper assessment of the necessary restoration works? Why did the works continue when the ground was being churned up? Has it been considered that the ground outside the tombs might contain archaeologically complex and multi-period deposits, as at Newgrange and Knowth in the Boyne valley?</P>
      <P>How does Dúchas propose to undo the unsightly and dangerous arrangement of gabions around the chamber of tomb No. 51? Why has the archaeologically excavated cutting that revealed the mid-winter rising sun alignment been backfilled? What will Dúchas do for the safety of the monument and the people visiting the megalithic earthwork on the chamber? What is meant by standard practice regarding the unsightly stone gabions, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and what other sites and monuments have suffered the same standard practice? Are these works necessarily conducted in this manner? The people of Sligo want to know if the work is for archaeological and heritage reasons, or is it tourism driven? In <i>The Sligo Champion</i> the field club expressed horror at and condemnation of these works.</P>
      <P>The tombs at Carrowmore are part of the largest and most controversial megalithic cemetery in western Europe. Does Dúchas realise the embarrassment caused to our archaeologists and people, particularly those of Sligo and the north west? In the words of Neill McCarthy, the Supreme Court judge in the 1989 ruling on the controversial Carrowmore dump, the question is being asked, &ldquo;Have the Irish no pride?&rdquo; Given the concept of a fallow area enshrined in the Supreme Court decision, are these works legal?</P>
      <P>The megalithic cemetery at Carrowmore is one of the largest in western Europe. Burnholt, of Sweden, recently excavated four tombs. He claims that one of them is among the earliest in the area. The cemetery covers an area one mile by a half. Today 45 tombs can be seen in the townland of Carrowmore. There may originally have been 150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Archaeologists and the people of Sligo are very concerned about the work done, particularly as regards who authorised it and why they did so. Was it done for tourism reasons? The biggest concern is that the midwinter rising sun alignment has been backfilled. What instruction will be given by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as regards future work? <Col N="1318" /> Why did Dúchas not have an archaeologist operating under licence, present during the entire works?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the opportunity presented by Deputy Perry's motion to outline the position in relation to the work which has been undertaken at Carrowmore megalithic cemetery. As Deputy Perry rightly pointed out in his motion, Carrowmore is one of the largest and most important of the megalithic cemeteries of western Europe and as such it is also one of the most important of the heritage sites managed by my Department.</P>
      <P>The cemetery at Carrowmore is an internationally renowned complex consisting of three main types of monuments, dolmens with surrounding stone-circles, stone circles without any visible monuments inside, and stone circles with central chambers or cysts, dating from the Stone Age &ndash; c5000 years old. It is one of Ireland's most important ancient sites ranking alongside Newgrange and Knowth. A number of monuments at Carrowmore pre-date Newgrange by several hundreds of years. It is believed that at one point there were more than 84 monuments in the area but due to extensive quarrying and land clearance in past centuries a large number of these monuments were destroyed.</P>
      <P>In 1989-90 the State purchased approximately 25 acres, on which stood a number of monuments and a small cottage. The cottage was developed for use as a basic visitor interpretative facility and this development marked the first stage in developing the Carrowmore archaeological complex. To fully understand the reinstatement works at Listoghil that are the cause of so much concern, both to me and to the public at large, a brief background to this very important monument is required.</P>
      <P>The Listoghil monument differs considerably from other tombs in the cemetery, both in terms of size and construction. Its central location in the middle of an oval-shaped cluster of other tombs makes it crucial to our understanding of the ritual function and symbolism of the whole cemetery. My Department facilitated a research excavation in 1996 by Professor Goran Burrenholt, associate professor at the department of archaeology in the university of Stockholm. The results of the excavation show that this was a complex multi-period monument, and with all such monuments the question arises as to how the monument should now be presented to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A works programme was drawn up which took archaeological considerations into account and work commenced in October 2000. There are in excess of 30,000 visitors to the archaeological complex each year and therefore for safety reasons it was decided to schedule the works for the off season. While the work to repair the cairn material was finished in early January 2001, further works are still required to complete the mounding of the tomb. Part of the work to repair the cairn material involved the transportation of <Col N="1319" /> stone gabions to the site. While this work was carried out in accordance with standard practice in relation to such work, because of the unprecedented heavy rainfall, the highest level in over 100 years, regrettably the machinery used formed ruts on the route to the tomb.</P>
    <P>Following a complete review of work carried out at Carrowmore in connection with the re-establishment of tomb 51 my Department has decided to engage the services of a consultant archaeologist to investigate and record any archaeology that may have been disturbed by the use of machinery on site. It is normal practice to engage such services for archaeological work at State sites. Resulting from this investigation, my Department in consultation with the consultant archaeologist will access what further remedial action is required. In addition, I intend to establish an internal working group, including my Department's senior architect and archaeologist for the Sligo area, to reconsider the question of the final presentation of the tomb and the time frame for carrying out the necessary work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> In the light of the current position regarding foot and mouth disease I cannot give a commitment as to when the work I have just outlined can take place, particularly the assessment of the site. However, I am satisfied completion of the work will ensure that there will not be a long-term adverse impact to this important site from the recent works.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the drink driving provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended, the obligation to provide a specimen of blood-urine or breath is confined to drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles who have been found driving such vehicles.</P>
      <P>The road traffic Acts provide for preliminary road side screening, commonly known as a breathalyser, of a driver where a garda is of the opinion that the driver has consumed an intoxicant, that is, alcohol or a drug or a combination of both drugs and alcohol. Evidential samples of blood-urine and breath are taken in the Garda station.</P>
      <P>I should also state that the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended, also provide for the taking of blood or urine specimen in a hospital from a driver suspected of being involved in a road traffic accident. In the case of fatal accidents it would be normal practice for the coroner to arrange for a post mortem examination of a body by a pathologist. I understand that in such cases it is normal practice for the pathologist to arrange for a toxicological examination, the examination of body fluids.</P>
      <P>I have no statutory responsibility for the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended, which are a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. However, I understand that he is considering in the context of the Road Traffic Bill and in accordance with the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, some changes which would provide for the possible selective application of random testing and screening of drivers. I understand that the Bill is currently being drafted by the parliamentary draughtsman as a matter of urgency and will be published shortly.</P>

      <Quest>when he expects to bring legislative proposals to Government to establish, on a statutory basis, the new agency to deal with the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees; the terms of reference in this regard; if it will be independent of his Department; if it will have its own budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 March, 2000 the Government agreed with my recommendations for the establishment of a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, called the reception and integration agency. It replaces the directorate for asylum support services and incorporates the refugee agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the new agency operates on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the reception and integration agency follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The reception and integration agency is the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment facilitates a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. The agency has responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government in 1999.</P>
      <P>The agency like its predecessor &ndash; the Directorate for Asylum Support Services &ndash; will continue to function on a cross agency/departmental multi-disciplinary basis. In that regard, in addition to my own Department, staff assigned to it are drawn from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Defence Forces and the Red Cross.</P>
      <P>I have also appointed an interim advisory board to the new agency. This board is chaired by Mr. Raymond Rooney and has 15 members made up of seven members of the wider community and one representative each of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Finance and the director of the reception and integration agency on an <i>ex-officio </i>basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it would be premature at this stage to set out in precise terms the nature or content of the <Col N="1323" /> legislation to be put in place in respect of the agency, I can confirm that my thinking is that it would be along similar lines to that which underpins other agencies and services in the wider justice area. Moreover, I believe that the interim advisory board should also be afforded an opportunity to consider and to bring forward its views on this matter in advance of any decision on it by the Government.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to this House, most recently in replies to questions on 7 February 2001, I accept the need for legislative changes in relation to complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. This is a matter which is being pursued in the context of a comprehensive review I am carrying out in the area of Garda complaints. Deputies will appreciate that the relevant issues raise important and complex concerns.</P>
      <P>The review of the Garda complaints machinery and procedures is very close to finalisation and I will submit my proposals for appropriate legislative changes to the Government as quickly as possible. When the Government has considered the matter I will make a further statement.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the question of appointing a Garda ombudsman on previous occasions in this House and also in the replies I gave on 7 February. As Deputies will be aware, a police ombudsman was established in Northern Ireland as part of a series of very specific confidence building measures in relation to the police in that jurisdiction. This is a matter I have considered, on an ongoing basis, in the context of the Garda Síochána and I am not satisfied that such arrangements would be either appropriate or beneficial here.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that overtime hours worked by members of the Garda Síochána are monitored <Col N="1324" /> at many levels, at district office, divisional office, regional office and by the finance section at Garda headquarters.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that decisions to authorise overtime duty lies with local Garda management and involves factors such as the operational requirements and the availability of members. I am further advised that overtime is authorised only when all other reasonable avenues are exhausted. The Garda members referred to in the question do not all work in the same area.</P>
      <P>The objective of Garda overtime is to allow the Garda Síochána flexibility in responding to circumstances that require personnel resources over and above those available from gardaí on rostered duty. The number of gardaí on duty at any one time depends on a variety of factors including the needs of the situation and the nature of work of particular units. A large proportion of Garda personnel are rostered in such a way that, on average, about 20% to 25% of that personnel &ndash; somewhat higher at times of greater need and lower at other times &ndash; is rostered to work at any given time during a 24 hour period. The current strength of the force is approximately 11,600 members.</P>
      <P>The nature of Garda work and the requirement that the Garda authorities respond at short notice to crisis situations means that overtime expenditure is sometimes unavoidable for the purposes of effective policing.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for a number of statutory provisions in relation to the reconciliation of work and family life, which are available to employees generally.</P>
      <P>Last year I set up a working group to review and improve maternity protection legislation in accordance with commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The working group agreed its recommendations in November 2000. The Government has approved implementation of all the recommendations in the report and has also decided to amend the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 to reflect the proposed changes to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, where appropriate. Yesterday, I announced the publication of the report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation.</P>
      <P>The increases in the periods of maternity and adoptive leave were announced in Budget 2001. As Deputies are no doubt aware, I, together with my colleagues the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, made Orders on 8 February 2001, implementing the increases in maternity and adoptive leave. The increases will apply to persons who commence maternity or adoptive leave on or after 8 March next.</P>
      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998 provides for an individual and non-transferable right to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work for both parents in respect of children under the age of five years. There are certain exceptions to this age limit in the case of adoptions. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 will be conducted this year, in consultation with the social partners. The review will commence later this month. I look forward to presenting the report to this House later this year.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has published two Bills, which also assist considerably in providing family friendly work places for employees in general.</P>
      <P>The first Bill entitled Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 complements the Government's budget 2000 proposal to introduce a carer's benefit scheme which is being administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs since 26 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill delivers on the undertaking given by the Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to introduce such legislation. ICTU and IBEC are supportive of the legislation. The Bill is a unique and innovative social policy that seeks to support people during a difficult period. The proposals will allow employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care <Col N="1326" /> and attention for those needing it, for a period of up to 65 weeks. The Bill commenced Second Stage in this House on 7 February last.</P>
    <P>The second Bill is the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000. This Bill transposes the provisions of the EU Council Directive concerning the Framework Agreement on Part-time Work concluded by the social partners at European level. The purpose of the directive is to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers. It aims to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work. The directive is also intended to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of both employees and employers. The Bill was published on 15 December 2000 and passed Second Stage in this House on 14 February 2001.</P>
    <P>Family friendly working schemes which have been available for some time in the Civil Service include flexible working hours, job-sharing, career break, special leave and term-time. Work sharing is intended to expand the scope of the existing job-sharing scheme by providing a wider range of attendance patterns with a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in pay. Discussions with the staff unions on the introduction of the work sharing scheme are currently at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the scheme will be introduced Civil Service wide by mid-2001. The terms of a pilot teleworking scheme have been agreed with the staff unions and a small scale pilot is in operation in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The pilot will be reviewed shortly. Many of these schemes are also available throughout the wider public service.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2001 a Civil Service child care initiative was announced which will see the allocation of £10 million to allow for the provision of 15 Civil Service crèches over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The availability of child care is a vital part of the development of family friendly practices. I am sure the Deputy is aware that child care has been identified as a priority in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and £250 million comprising EU and Exchequer funds has been provided to my Department to develop child care provision. Further funding of £40 million was made available to a number of Departments by the Government in October 2000 by way of further supports for the child care sector.</P>
    <P>Under the equal opportunities child care programme, which I launched in April 2000, supports are available which are designed to achieve the main objectives of the programme which are to increase the number of child care places and facilities available and to improve the quality of child care throughout the country. Capital grants are available to community based and private providers, staffing grants are available to eligible community groups and other funding is available to national voluntary child care organisations <Col N="1327" /> towards child care training and for local child care networks.</P>
    <P>A national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise has been set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It includes representatives of IBEC, public sector employers, ICTU, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The national framework committee is focusing on supporting and facilitating family friendly policies through the development of a package of practical measures that can be applied at the level of the enterprise. My Department is providing funding of £4 million under the equality for women measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to develop family friendly projects in employment and the sharing of family friendly responsibilities. Of this funding, £1.5 million has been allocated to support the work of the national framework committee.</P>
    <P>The national framework committee has proposed today, 1 March, as family friendly workplace day. There will be a launch by the Tánaiste of a website to promote and inform discussion on family friendly policies and of a brochure outlining family friendly work arrangements.</P>
    <P>My Department, together with the European Commission, is co-funding research on the reconciliation of work and family roles, with a particular emphasis on how to involve men in family and domestic activities. The research project is led by the Centre for Gender and Women's Studies, TCD, and involves a four country comparative study covering Ireland, France, Denmark and Italy. The research will include a focus on attitudes of men and women as workers and parents and social policies designed to address these issues. The national framework committee is also planning a series of regional seminars.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to a written parliamentary question which was answered by all Ministers on 20 February, outlining the plans of all Ministers in marking family friendly workplace day for staff in their respective Departments.</P>

      <P>On 11 May 1999 during an operation at night in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda air support unit, GASU, helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport. The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investi<Col N="1328" /> gation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise.

      <P>Under present arrangements, the training and allocation of pilots is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Defence and the Air Corps.

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which came into operation on 18 October 1999 prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds including age. The Equal Status Act, 2000, which came into operation on 25 October 2000, prohibits discrimination on the same nine grounds in relation to the provision of goods and services, accommodation, disposal of premises and education.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act also provided for the establishment of the Equality Authority which replaced the Employment Equality Agency. The role of the authority was extended under the Equal Status Act. The authority has statutory responsibility to work towards the elimination of discrimination on the nine grounds covered by the legislation and to promote equality of opportunity in relation to matters to which the Acts apply.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the end of January 2001, the authority has received over 4,500 inquiries in relation to the Employment Equality Act, 1998. Approximately 14% of these inquiries related to age. The authority has pursued 26 cases in relation to the age ground under the Employment Equality Act. This may involve, for example, contacting employers with a view to resolving complaints in relation to possible age discrimination and in some instances the referral of a case by the authority to the director of equality investigations. The authority has received 2,150 inquiries under <Col N="1329" /> the Equal Status Act, 2000 up to the end of January and approximately 17% of these inquiries related to age.

The Minister is required to refer such an application to the refugee applications commissioner for the purposes of investigating the application and submitting a report thereon.

    <P>Prosecution figures for all driving licence offences for the year 2000 to date are not yet published.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of the Garda road safety initiative for 2001 Operation Target is focusing on young drivers. The operation deals with driving licence offences including offences relating to unaccompanied drivers who are on provisional licences.</P>
    <P>In addition to enforcement, Operation Target involves the distribution of leaflets to young drivers giving advice in relation to the requirement to be accompanied while driving on a provisional licence; the display of L plates; wearing seat belts; and driving with care, courtesy and consideration. This campaign is also operating under the overall Garda road safety campaign, Operation Lifesaver, which is focusing on speeding, drink driving, seat belt offences and dangerous-careless driving. In addition to the measures taken by the gardaí which I have outlined, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who has responsibility for road traffic legislation has also put in place a number of measures in relation to driver testing and competency. These measures include the recruitment of additional testers, the reduction of the test waiting time and the planned introduction of a written test.</P>

      <P>Section 4(1) of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, requires a judge to seek a probation and welfare officer's report before making a community service order in an individual case. No request for such a report was received in either of the two cases referred to by the Deputies. There are occasions where probation and welfare officers are unable to respond to requests from the courts for such reports. This is due to an agreement reached between management and the union representing probation and welfare staff in relation to workloads.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by my Department to address the question of vacancies in the Probation and Welfare Service. The Civil Service Commission held a recruitment campaign in recent months to fill both existing vacancies and newly sanctioned posts in the Probation and Welfare Service and offers of appointment are currently in the process of being made to successful candidates. In addition, my Department recently advertised for the recruitment of 25 additional full-time temporary unestablished positions of probation and welfare officer. Assignments to fill vacancies in the service will be made as candidates from both these competitions take up duty in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the consequences of so-called joyriding for local communities. It is, however, a complex problem which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to legislative matters, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-93, are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they continually monitor trends in unauthorised takings, with a view to identifying and targeting both persistent offenders and areas prone to such activities. Each Garda division has a traffic unit which, outside of peak traffic hours, targets incidents of joyriding. Local responses to joyriding have also been developed in recent years. For <Col N="1335" /> example, the Probation and Welfare Service operates an auto crime diversion project in Cork city. In Dublin, &ldquo;Operation Steering Wheel&rdquo; was devised by the Garda Síochána to deal specifically with the problem of joyriding in the Coolock Garda sub-district. The operation is ongoing and comprises uniform, foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. Moreover, in west Tallaght, a special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí was established to specifically target incidents of joyriding.</P>
    <P>In terms of preventative activities, I have significantly increased the number of Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 51 at present, with a view to diverting young persons away from this and other forms of crime. I also understand that Garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí avail of every opportunity during the course of their work, particularly in implementing the schools programme, to educate young persons to the dangers posed by joyriding.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is also involved in both the south Dublin inter-agency working group on joyriding/anti-social activity and the Priorswood task force on joyriding. The latter group produced a highly professional research report which I officially launched last month and to which my Department is giving full consideration.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in the implementation of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, particularly in regard to the provisions relating to underage drinking; if he plans any new initiatives to deal with this problem; if all sections of the Act have been implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>All provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, except sections 15 and 17, are in operation since July 2000. The Act provides for considerable strengthening of those provisions which already existed in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to underage persons. As a result of these changes, the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in relation to the age of a person is no longer available in proceedings against the licensee, fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking have been increased and where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an underage person is upheld, the licensed premises can be closed for a specified period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner recently about the enforcement of the laws on underage drinking. I have been assured by him that the Garda Síochána is resolutely enforcing those laws. There has been misleading comment to the effect that there has been only <Col N="1336" /> one conviction under the 2000 Act since it came into operation. This is simply not the case. Since July 2000 six licensed premises have had, as a result of convictions under the Act, temporary closure orders made against them and the Garda is pursuing cases in respect of another 80 premises nationwide. Three premises have been closed for seven days, two for five days, and one for three days. While it takes time for any new law to begin to have effect, it is clear from the figures to date that the law is working and that it is beginning to have the desired deterrent effect. The commissioner's view is that the new law provides the Garda with all the necessary powers. I have assured him that if further strengthening of the law is required the Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on preparation of the regulations necessary to give effect to section 15 of the Act. These will prescribe the form of the notice to be displayed in licensed premises containing a statement of the offences in relation to underage drinking. Practical difficulties, adverted to during debates on the Bill in the House, concerning the operation of section 17 of the Act are still under consideration in my Department. That section places an onus on licensees to identify themselves on any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises.</P>
    <P>Reform of our liquor licensing system has not ended with the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, and the House will be aware that on 1 November last I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. Its terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws including an examination of the problems associated with under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>With regard to further initiatives, I officially launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities who have taken the following steps to promote the use of the age card. All Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters. Non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters. A poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night-clubs and dance halls, etc. Youth information centres and youth groups nation wide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support. Garda juvenile liaison officers-community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects, etc. highlighting the age card scheme. There is ongoing liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochána and new avenues of ensuring young people get the age card message are being explored.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that to date 23,300 age cards have been issued. However, while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme can help to curtail the problem of underage drinking, it cannot, of <Col N="1337" /> course, be viewed as the total solution. Dealing with the underage drinking problem should not be seen as a matter for State agencies only &ndash; parents, teachers, politicians, the drinks industry and the media must also play their part in helping to address the problem.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to introduce paid parental leave. However, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that my Department will conduct a review this year of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners. This commitment is in accordance with section 28 of the Act which provides for a review of the operation of the Act within not less than two years and not more than three years of its commencement on 3 December 1998. As announced in the budget, it is proposed to advance this review with a view to improvement of the arrangements in this area. Only yesterday, I announced that the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, would commence this month. This review will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of its operation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the numbers who have qualified for parental leave, the Parental Leave Act, 1998, provides an individual and non-transferable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. The entitlement originally applied to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996. The Act was amended by the European Communities (Parental Leave) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No 231 of 2000), with effect from 19 July 2000. The effect of the amendment is to extend the parental leave entitlement of 14 weeks unpaid parental leave to parents of children born between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996 or children born on or after 3 December 1993, in whose case an adoption order was made between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996; this leave must be taken not later than 31 December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, an employee must have one year's continuous service with the employer before she or he is entitled to take parental leave. However, where the child is approaching the age threshold and the employee has more than three months, but less than one year's continuous service with the employer, she-he is entitled to<i> pro rata</i> parental leave. In such a case, the employee is entitled to one week's leave for every month of <Col N="1338" /> continuous employment completed with the employer when the leave begins.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics available centrally in relation to the uptake of parental leave. Individual employers are, however, required under section 27 of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, to keep records of parental leave taken by their employees.</P>

      <P>My Department authorised the importation of approximately 100 tonnes of fireworks during the five years ended 28 February 2001. Only one incident, in which a spectator was injured, was brought to the attention of my Department during that period. As I indicated in the Dáil on 25 October 2000 during an adjournment debate on fireworks, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the legislation relating to explosives. The issues relating to fireworks will be addressed in the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>It is neither practical nor reasonable to expect me to address questions relating to the use of terminology by media organisations as referred to in the Deputies' questions in the absence of adequate additional information on the context and general circumstances in which such terminology was used in any particular case.</P>
      <P>The statutory provisions, determining factors and terminology governing the grant or refusal of an application for refugee status are set out in the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which gives effect to the convention relating to the status of refugees of 1951 and the related 1967 protocol. I am informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that where an applicant claims a fear of persecution, that claim is investigated within the definition of a refugee contained in the 1996 Act having regard to the subjective fear of the applicant and to the objective country of origin information. A recommendation is made depending on the circumstances applicable in each individual case. A claim is either well-founded or unfounded having regard to the provisions of the 1996 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that anyone who is genuinely in need of protection from persecution will be offered that protection in the State in the context of our obligations under the Geneva Convention. Those obligations are at the core of our strategy in the asylum area which centres of the operation of a fast, fair and efficient system which quickly provides determinations in well-founded cases and equally provides an effective, fast and fair response to unfounded claims. However, there is a reality that the asylum system currently operating internationally is being misused and many would argue being extensively abused with large numbers of persons seeking protection under the Geneva Convention for the sole purpose of evading legitimate immigration controls in order to gain a foothold in countries for economic reasons. The UNHCR in the past has also expressed concern about the abuse of asylum <Col N="1340" /> determination systems. Governments and agencies involved are spending vast amounts in dealing with unfounded applications. As well as the heavy financial burden which this places on national exchequers and taxpayers in the receiving countries, it is also diverting resources &ndash; both financial and human &ndash; away from dealing speedily with those persons whose claims for refugee status are well-founded having regard to the provisions of the 1951 Convention and the 1996 Refugee Act. It is also the reality that our asylum determination process is being abused by traffickers and people smugglers. In these circumstances, it is perhaps inevitable that media and public comment is going to focus on what is seen as very significant misuse of the asylum process.</P>
    <P>I also refer the Deputies to my replies to the following Parliamentary Questions: No. 1043 of 30 January 2001 which shows that of the applications considered in the year 2000, only 7 per cent were granted refugee status; No. 169 of 22 February 2001 which draws attention to the substantial number of applications that were withdrawn and deemed abandoned in the year 2000; No. 84 of 7 February 2001 which refers, <i>inter alia,</i> to the decisions made at first instance in respect of asylum applications in 2000. Of the total number of decisions taken at first instance, 97% were refused status. Of those refused status some 35% were found to be manifestly unfounded. Of 1,436 manifestly unfounded first instance decisions considered in 2000 at appeal, 92% were upheld and, accordingly, the respective appeals were refused.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech at the launch of the Dunbrody emigrant ship, the Taoiseach said &ldquo;As a country with a sometimes bitter experience of emigration, it seems very important that we remember the hardships and prejudices we faced in the past while we promote equality and tolerance and reject racism and prejudice wherever we find it. I believe it would be a great betrayal of our emigrant legacy to confuse a fair and realistic approach to migration policies on the one hand <Col N="1341" /> with anything less than full openness to cultural diversity on the other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to combating racism and promoting a tolerant, inclusive society is clear from its record. We now have a comprehensive anti-discrimination legal code in place. Racial discrimination in employment, training, accommodation, education and the supply of goods and services, including public services, is outlawed by the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission which is being established will be a powerful new independent body charged with the task of keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of our laws in relation to the protection of human rights in their widest sense.</P>
    <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, makes it an offence to incite hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the Traveller community. The Act is under review at present to see if it can be made more effective.</P>
    <P>Social inclusion strategies, including those under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the area of social inclusion-anti-poverty-education have encompassed marginalised social groups including Travellers and other minorities. Action will be taken, where appropriate, to specifically incorporate an anti-racism dimension.</P>
    <P>Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD, in December 2000. The EU Race Directive was adopted in June 2000 and steps will be taken to make any necessary amendments to domestic legislation to bring it into force here.</P>
    <P>An equality infrastructure has been put in place to underpin our anti-discrimination legislation, the Equality Authority and the Office of Director of Equality Investigations. They provide free advice and redress to those who have suffered racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI, was established. The NCCRI has been instrumental in drawing together key Government bodies and NGO groups to address racism.</P>
    <P>The NCCRI, as part of its overall aim of developing an integrated approach against racism, introduced an anti-racism protocol for political parties and a declaration of intent for candidates for elections.</P>
    <P>The gardaí, under the auspices of the Garda community relations section, have recently established a Garda intercultural unit. In addition a working group has been reviewing all aspects of Garda training in the area of human rights in order to develop best practices in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment.</P>
    <P>An anti-racism in the workplace week, organised jointly by IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation, ICTU and the Equality Authority took place from 6 to 10 November, 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> In 1998, the Government allocated a sum of £900,000 to fund a Traveller communications programme over a three year period 1999 to 2001. The objective of the programme, entitled Citizen Traveller, is to address the underlying causes of mistrust between Travellers and the settled community and to promote a greater understanding between both communities.</P>
    <P>In addition to this awareness campaign, the Government agreed to proposals for a framework for a comprehensive public awareness campaign, with a core budget of £1.5 million per annum over a three year period, to address racism and promote a more inclusive, intercultural society. This programme commences this year. I have appointed a high level steering group representative of ethnic minorities, social partners and relevant Departments and agencies to implement the programme. The first meeting of the high level steering group was planned to be held on 28 February 2001 but owing to adverse weather conditions it had to be postponed. Arrangements are being made for an alternative date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the procedures in place for the determination of temporary release for prisoners are more than adequate in meeting both the objective of public safety and the requirement for prisoner rehabilitation. There is always an element of risk in this area <Col N="1343" /> and the key task is to find ways to minimise this risk as far as possible. In this regard, when temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions. Standard conditions applied in every case are that the prisoner on release must be of good behaviour and of sober habits. In addition the majority of prisoners on temporary release must report daily to a Garda station. Other more specific conditions tailored to possible risks in individual cases are often applied including, for example, a prohibition on visiting or residing in a particular location. If any of these conditions are breached, the person on temporary release may be rearrested, without warrant, by the gardaí and returned directly to prison without the need for a further court appearance.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases, temporary release is now granted for constructive and rehabilitative reasons. For example, a prisoner may be released to attend educational and-or training programmes or courses. Another reason is to participate in work training with recognised agencies such as CONNECT or PACE. The aim of this form of temporary release is to help the prisoner with employment prospects on the outside which will have the effect of reducing the risk of reoffending. In addition short periods of temporary release to visit family members may be granted to prisoners in an effort to reduce the effects of institutionalisation and to aid familiarisation with the outside world.</P>
      <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given in each individual case to a number of factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The primary concern in considering whether to grant temporary release is the safety of the public. It is important to note that decisions are only made following consultations with the Garda and local prison officials. Other matters considered are whether the prisoner has engaged constructively with the various prison based therapeutic services such as the Probation and Welfare Service, educational and work training programmes, and-or drug treatment programmes.</P>
      <P>As well as allowing prisoners short periods of release on compassionate grounds or to attend important family events, temporary release arrangements are, in effect, our system of parole which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. Paroles are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned re-integration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community anyway on the expiration of their sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that the majority <Col N="1344" /> of prisoners on temporary release are either on structured temporary release programmes, often under the direct supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service, or are on short temporary release periods for valid compassionate reasons such as ill health or a death in the family.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that, as a direct consequence of the ongoing prison building programme, there has been a considerable reduction in the proportion of prisoners on temporary release. This figure has fallen from 19 per cent of the total prison population in October 1996 to a current figure of 6 per cent. The actual number has fallen from 550 to less than 200 in the same time period.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. The intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities, for example, Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, the National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna, etc. have also placed considerable strain on the registry's ability to provide essential services. In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. The resultant appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an E commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>

      <P>As a general principle, I hold that prisoners' healthcare arrangements should fully match public healthcare provision in the general community. Because of often chaotic lifestyles on the outside, many prisoners present as requiring special medical attention in custody. The period of imprisonment often represents a real opportunity to address long-standing and damaging lifestyle patterns such as drug or alcohol addiction which undermine personal health and social competence. Prisoners can be a demanding group as patients but their demands are often quite reasonable and their period in custody represents a positive opportunity from a public health perspective.</P>
      <P>In view of the rapid expansion of the prison system and the ongoing development of healthcare services in the community, I established a group in November 1999 to review the structure and organisation of prisons health care services. The terms of reference of this group are  to consider and make recommendations regarding the structure and organisation of primary medical and nursing services within the prison environment in light of the development of health care services generally and the needs of the prison population; to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners, taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramifications of possible new mental health legislation; to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly; to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system; to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations; and to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection.</P>

As the review is still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the group's work at this time. I expect to have a report from the group by mid-2001.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible. Any recommendations made by this group in relation to improving prison health care services will be treated as a matter of priority by me.</P>

      <P>Guidelines in the form of a Government decision taken in March 1993 were issued to all Departments. The Government decided that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their <Col N="1348" /> aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. These guidelines were extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature, etc. My Department monitors progress in appointing women to State boards on a regular basis and keeps the situation under review.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue the policy objective of gender balance on State boards, with a minimum target of 40% of women and men in direct appointments. I will also continue to encourage nominating bodies to adopt a similar policy. Substantial progress has already been made in relation to gender balance on boards. Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nominating bodies, increased from 15% in 1992 to 28% at 30 September, 2000 and from 17% to 34% of ministerial nominations in the same period. Each Minister is responsible for implementing the gender balance policy in her or his area.</P>
      <P>A reason for the imbalance between men and women on State boards is that women have not yet reached top management levels in many areas. Recently published research on gender equality in the Civil Service demonstrates this. This research report stated that women, compared with men, can expect to enter at a lower level and progress more slowly through the grading structures and as a result they can expect to be paid less. Further work needs to be done to ensure that women achieve equality.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with the social partners, to undertake during the course of the programme an examination of the low representation of women at decision making levels. The breakdown of membership of boards in each Department for end September 2000, the most recent period for which figures are available, is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>The selection criteria for the recruitment of Garda trainees are prescribed by regulation and are reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department. The minimum educational qualifications are not the only prerequisite for entry to the Garda College. Applicants must be successful in a competition, comprising written tests and a competitive interview conducted by the Civil Service Commission on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. These selection procedures are underpinned by a professional job analysis led by consultants, to ensure that the procedures are job-related and assess candidates for those com<Col N="1350" /> petencies required for effective performance in the job of Garda.</P>
      <P>I regard both the minimum educational qualifications and the Civil Service Commission selection procedures as being important in the overall recruitment process.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to amend the educational requirements for entry to An Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Road Safety Initiative 2001 falls within the terms of the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 and consists of a targeted series of national traffic and vehicle law enforcement operations. The Garda National Road Safety Initiative 2001 is also operating under the umbrella of Operation Lifesaver 1997-2002 which is focusing on speeding, drink driving, seat-belt compliance and dangerous-careless driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Operation Lifesaver is nationwide and is run on a continuous basis. It is monitored by the Garda National Traffic Bureau based at Garda headquarters which is headed by a chief superintendent and is the subject of continuous review.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 2001 campaign four key national issues have been identified. They are speeding, drink driving, seat-belt compliance and vulnerable road users.</P>
    <P>Of course the primary purpose of all operations to be undertaken this year is increased road safety and a reduction in the number of collisions and fatal accidents on our roads, through changes in driver and pedestrian behaviour. This will be achieved with a high degree of Garda visibility in three broad ways, by enforcing traffic and vehicle law; by helping to educate the public into safer road behaviour; and by trying to maintain the free flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002, Operation Lifesaver, which has run since 1997, will remain the principal operation during the current year. This will be complemented and enhanced by a number of Garda operations which will focus on specific offences and road user behaviour, for example, traffic light infringements, pedestrian safety, and motorcycle offences, in addition to any local strategies or operations planned.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that, while each operation has a specific focus, all vehicles may be subject to close scrutiny and any offences disclosed will be appropriately dealt with.</P>

    <P>When a person is reported missing, the case is assessed by the Garda Síochána, and for the overwhelming majority of such missing persons, including the women to which the above statistics relate, the cases are speedily resolved. The number of women in Leinster who remained untraced at the end of the years mentioned is seven.</P>
    <P>Where the gardaí consider that a person is genuinely missing, a full Garda investigation takes place under the supervision and direction of the local district officer. An investigation team is immediately convened which draws together any specialist resources which the district officer considers are necessary to locate the missing person. In addition, every district has a specially trained search team which is familiar with the locality. At division level, investigations are co-ordinated by the relevant chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result of this ongoing review, substantial changes were introduced in 1998, which included the bringing into operation of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed of developments by a liaison officer, who deals with a designated family member.</P>
    <P>Operation Trace was established by the Garda commissioner to review the cases of six women who went missing in the Leinster region between 1993 and 1999 and, in particular, to establish whether any common denominator links these cases.</P>
    <P>The manner in which these women disappeared creates particular difficulties for the investigating members of the Garda Síochána. The absence of any discernible crime scene means that criminal profiling is not possible and that analysis based on crime scene examination and pathological evidence is not available. Victim profiling has not established any link between the cases.</P>
    <P>All information relating to the separate investigations is systematically and vigorously pursued. Operation Trace has yielded new lines of inquiries which are being pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. Furthermore, a unique database has been devised which facilitates the cross referencing of detailed information.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that he has full confidence in Operation Trace and, as <Col N="1353" /> with all Garda operations, it is under continuous review to ensure that it remains effective. I also refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 348 to 350 of 20 February 2001.</P>

One, conducted by another assistant commissioner, relates to matters raised by the then Opposition spokespersons on justice and the other investigation, conducted by a chief superintendent, relates to a matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation.

      <P>While the scheme is a non-statutory one, any proposals for changes to the scheme, which may be recommended as part of the review, will require the approval of Government and the revised scheme will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 provides for the availability of advice and representation by a solicitor and, if necessary, a barrister to persons of modest means, at little cost, in civil cases. Aid is available for representation for proceedings in the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While at present the majority of the Legal Aid Board's case load comes from the area of family law, the Act does provide for legal services to be available in a wide range of civil matters. For example, during 1999, legal advice was provided in 3,300 non-family matters and legal aid was pro<Col N="1355" /> vided in 146 such cases. Non-family law areas covered by the board on a regular basis include such matters as medical negligence, professional negligence, personal injury, contractual disputes, unfair dismissal, debt, property matters and landlord and tenant disputes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that advice and aid in relation to certain civil law matters are specifically excluded under the Act including defamation, disputes concerning rights and interests over land, civil matters within the jurisdiction of the District Court (Small Claims Procedure) Rules, 1993, licensing, conveyancing, representation before tribunals and election petitions. A conveyancing service may be provided if the issue follows from a family law matter for which a legal aid certificate previously issued. There are also limited circumstances whereby representation may be provided in respect of disputes concerning rights and interests over land, for example, in cases where an agreement to marry has been terminated or if the issue concerns the family home and infirmity of mind or duress are suspected</P>
    <P>I would mention to the Deputy that the service provided by the Legal Aid Board is now widely accessible to the public. The board currently operates full-time law centres at 31 locations around the country and part-time law centres at a further 13 locations. I consider that the case mix handled by the board is a reflection of demand rather than of any limitations imposed by the Act. I can assure the Deputy that the operation of the Act will continue to be monitored by my Department, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 87 from Deputy Upton as recently as 7 February 2001, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, has been the subject of review from time to time. The most recent review, in 1998, was carried out in the context of an EU review of member states' compliance with an EU joint action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. That joint action is now the subject of further review by the EU. To date, no changes in the law have resulted from these reviews. Nevertheless, some time ago I announced a further review of the legislation in my Department. While I cannot at this stage predict a timescale, I hope to conclude the review as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Section 9(1) of the Act requires that an applicant who has applied at the frontiers of the State be given leave to enter the State and section 9(2) gives an asylum applicant an entitlement to remain in the State until the application has been dealt with. The Act does not provide for the making of an application outside of the State or to officials of ferry or airline carriers, whether the vessels in question are Irish registered or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, I have not personally received the report to which the Deputy referred. I am informed that the report was submitted directly to the director general of the Prisons Service who has studied the report and met with representatives from the Prison Officers Association last week to discuss their views and recommendations. The director general has also <Col N="1357" /> called to the Dóchas centre in recent days to discuss personally with staff and inmates how the centre is operating.</P>
      <P>At this stage I would like to make a few general points on the design, regime and operation of the Dóchas centre. First, the design and consultation process for the women's prison took over two years and during this time every interested party, including staff representatives, were consulted. The resulting development represents a quantum leap in terms of working conditions for staff and living conditions for prisoners. As the most modern female prison in the western world, the Dóchas centre attracts hundreds of visits annually from prison experts and criminologists. It is regarded as a model of its kind and is currently the focus of a number of PhD studies by graduate students. The feedback from these researchers has to date been overwhelmingly positive.</P>
      <P>Prisons are built to last hundreds of years and the bedding in process in terms of management arrangements tends to be protracted. Opened only in September 1999 the adjustment process for prisoners and staff at the Dóchas centre continues. I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to tackle the issue of drug abuse in the prisoner population. It is the case that the majority of female offenders are in prison as a result of their extreme drug dependency. Unfortunately, many will make attempts to continue their abuse while in custody. I can, however, assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to tackling the drug problem in the prison system. For example, the action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I approved in 1999, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system.</P>
      <P>Efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system are being pursued vigorously. In this regard, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. On occasions where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, gardaí are called to the prison with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned. In this regard the Dóchas centre has facilities available to provide screened visits for prisoners who have attempted to or are regarded as susceptible to receiving drugs during visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that, due to higher than anticipated committal figures, there continues to be an overcrowding problem in the Dóchas centre. Planning for a new, purpose designed facility for females to replace the existing facilities at Limerick Prison for women prisoners is at an advanced stage. This project will increase the capacity there from 12 to 24 places. In addition, under the provisions of the Children's Bill, 1999, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old <Col N="1358" /> offenders. In this regard the prison building programme includes provision for a 100 place unit with full support facilities in the Dublin region comprising separate secure detention for up to 20 female offenders. I am satisfied that these developments will address the situation.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied at the way the Dóchas centre is progressing. Statistics provided by the governor of that institution show that incidents of self harm by inmates, attempted suicides and assaults on staff are significantly lower than in the old women's prison. The dialogue between staff representatives and management about the operation of the centre will continue and the Director General of the Prisons Service has undertaken to keep me informed in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government's national strategy on road safety gave a commitment that progress will be maintained in extending the use of automatic speed detection devices, both mobile and fixed. Fixed cameras are being operated on a pilot basis by the gardaí in conjunction with the National Roads Authority. The effectiveness in reducing speed and accidents of the present cameras is being evaluated.</P>
      <P>Future decisions on the purchase and deployment of fixed cameras will be influenced by the findings of the evaluation, bearing in mind that fixed cameras are only one element of Garda covert and overt operations in reducing speed. In this regard, there are six mobile cameras in operation throughout the State and the gardaí are in the process of acquiring a seventh mobile unit. Also, the gardaí possess a range of speed detection equipment including in car video systems, motor cycle mounted cameras, laser guns and tripod mounted lasers. Garda traffic management are satisfied that a combination of the use of mobile and fixed cameras as well as highly visible Garda checkpoints represents best practice in enforcing road traffic legislation.</P>

      <P>Many countries, including <Col N="1361" /> Ireland, have a web of laws that protect certain aspects of privacy. Several common law torts and a series of common law crimes and statutory offences are relevant in the context of surveillance. However, as scientific advances and technological developments have opened up new opportunities and possibilities for surveillance, concerns in relation to the invasion of privacy have been increasing.</P>
      <P>In so far as the use of closed circuit television cameras are concerned, I am pleased to say that legislative changes are pending in two important areas. First, as the House is aware, I have published the Private Security Services Bill, 2001, with a view to establishing the private security authority. The role of the authority will be to operate a licensing system in order to control and supervise companies and individuals providing security services. All suppliers and installers of security equipment, including closed circuit television cameras, and persons monitoring such security equipment, will come within the scope of the Act and it will be an offence to provide such a service without a licence. The aim is to maintain and improve standards across the private security industry. Applicants for licences will have to provide such references as to the applicant's character, financial position and competence as the authority may require. The authority may investigate any security service being provided by any person and will also investigate complaints against licensees in relation to the provision of security services.</P>
      <P>The second legislative initiative relates to data protection. In the coming months, I will be publishing a Bill to amend the Data Protection Act, 1988. This Bill will strengthen existing provisions in relation to processing of personal data and it will involve protection of information obtained by means of closed circuit television cameras.</P>

      <P>Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations under international law and the Constitution to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, it represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis. Asylum seekers in direct provision are generally paid reduced allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family <Col N="1362" /> Affairs. The relevant legislation is the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and regulations made pursuant to the primary legislation, that is, the Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Regulations, 1995. Every applicant for supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. The means test includes provision for the assessment of any benefit and privilege, including board and lodgings, enjoyed by the applicant.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, which introduced direct provision on 1 April last, and followed thorough investigation and planning.</P>
      <P>Direct provision for asylum seekers is the subject of ongoing liaison, discussion and consultation between the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. DASS is a cross department/agency which was established in November, 1999 under the aegis of my Department to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and preparation of plans for a system of direct provision of housing, welfare needs, etc. More recently, the functions of DASS are being discharged by the new Reception and Integration Agency.</P>
      <P>The practice of cross-Department-agency representation has been continued in the new agency and in that regard, senior staff from the Department of Health and Children as well as the Eastern Region Health Authority have been seconded to it. Moreover, liaison arrangements are in place between the agency and the Department of Health and Children in relation to the provision of health services to asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>In addition, DASS meets with local service providers in advance of opening new accommodation centres around the country and is in daily contact with the health boards on a wide range of issues related to direct provision, for example, the provision of health and welfare services including health screening, and the provision of advice and assistance to local voluntary support groups.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for <Col N="1363" /> refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.</P>
      <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. The Government is committed to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations and domestic rules and procedures with a view to providing the best possible service to all applicants. Applicants for asylum are treated with courtesy and professionalism by all members of staff from reception to the final stage of the process.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that all staff working in that office, including reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received and continue to receive on an ongoing basis on the job experience and training in respect of customer service, interviews, assessment, decision making and asylum procedures. The training programmes have been agreed with the UNHCR and are delivered by a combination of this office's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists, the UNHCR's full time official here, asylum experts from other countries and other agencies with the specialist skills required. The training provided includes procedures to be followed when dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence. Training on cultural awareness and in dealing with unaccompanied minors has been provided in conjunction with the UNHCR. The office of the RAC has also recently organised refresher training for all staff involved in interviewing and assessment in conjunction with the UNHCR and staff from that office have also attended training in agencies abroad such as the refugees studies programme in Oxford.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner considers all cases for asylum on the merits of the case having regard to the relevant background situation in the country of origin. Claims for refugee status span a broad range of diverse circumstances and relevant country of origin information plays a significant part when making a recommendation on an application for a declaration for refugee status. Research covers numerous areas such as factual data, human rights situations, geographical information, and other socio-economic data.</P>
      <P>A range of research sources, electronic and printed material, are available to authorised officers involved in interviewing and assessing applications for a declaration as a refugee. This information is updated regularly. The principal sources are set out in a tabular statement annexed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that staff receive specialised training provided by the UNHCR and <Col N="1364" /> can avail of the comprehensive training and development programme available throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A recent one day seminar specifically arranged for the members of the tribunal as part of their training covered issues such as analysis of claims, the refugee's experience of trauma, writing decisions and fair procedures. The new members will also receive training provided by the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>The tribunal also makes use of a number of internationally recognised data bases such as REFWORLD, UNHCR, the UK Home Office and the US State Department and others to ensure that staff and tribunal members, as appropriate, have available to them the most up to date information on the political and social situations in the country of origin of the individual asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>The Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act, 2000, allows for payment of a lump sum of £20,000 each to certain former employees or in the case of deceased former employees, their personal representative. They must have been employed in the company for a period of not less than two years which was a period of continuous employment and continued to be so employed on 1 November 1986 or later.</P>
      <P>With regard to the person concerned, the interdepartmental committee established under the Act has reviewed his application in respect of his deceased relative. The interdepartmental committee has found that his application is ineligible for the payment because it does not meet these requirements and in particular, it does not meet the requirement of the deceased relative being employed by the Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited on 1 November 1986 or later. In the circumstances, his application has been refused. The Act provides that any refusal may be appealed to the appeals officer, appointed by me under the legislation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the spouses of former employees of Dublin Gas who had retired before BGE acquired the assets of the company in 1987. The request for a spouses pension on a non-contributory basis for these workers was examined in detail both by my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The request was not approved on the basis that on taking over the old Dublin Gas Company, BGE accepted liability to continue the payment of pensions in accordance with the terms of the pension scheme under which the pensioners retired. No commitment existed that these arrangements would be subject to review or enhancement. Any concession regarding payment of a spouses pension on a non-contributory basis would lead to knock-on effects in both private and public sector schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed under a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme to include chronic arthritis, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer considers the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the LTI scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999, replacing <Col N="1372" /> the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous ones and is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Studies and reviews of the question of health and safety in regard to mobile phone masts have already been carried out internationally. The World Health Organisation has assessed the many scientific reviews of possible health effects associated with radio frequency fields of mobile phone systems. The WHO has stated that none of these reviews has concluded that exposure to radio frequency fields from mobile phone transmitter masts, sometimes referred to as base stations, causes any adverse health consequences. The WHO identified a need for further research to better assess possible health risks. The WHO in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields, including those associated with mobile phone masts. This project will bring together current knowledge and available <Col N="1374" /> resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments. Medical officers in my Department keep up to date with developments in this area. I have no plans to launch an independent inquiry into the safety of mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>Approval for the erection of mobile phone masts in a particular area is a function of the local planning authority. Guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to all local authorities in relation to location of mobile phone masts recommend that where possible free standing masts should not be located in residential areas or beside schools. Operators of mobile phone systems are required to comply with emission levels set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all scientific literature, including thermal and non-thermal effects.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of the levels of emissions from mobile phone masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and that office publishes an audit report of licensed operators each year. The most recent report published in February 2000 focuses on compliance with the general public exposure limits specified by the ICNIRP. The report shows that all the companies audited have procedures and arrangements in place to ensure compliance with the general public exposure limits.</P>

      <P>At present the holding of outdoor events is subject to the planning code. A person must seek planning permission to hold an event at a particular venue, unless there is an established authorised use for the holding of events at the venue. However, a new licensing procedure is provided for under Part XVI of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 for the holding of outdoor events. Under these provisions a licence will be required for the holding of prescribed events, or classes of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations to be made under this Act will set out the procedure to apply for a licence, including public notification and the timeframes for deciding such applications. The local authority may decide to refuse or grant such a licence, either with or without conditions. The authority may attach conditions to ensure, amongst other things, compliance with codes of conduct, public safety <Col N="1376" /> and order at events, and the abatement of nuisance to residents. The authority may also require the payment of a financial contribution to it or to other bodies, for example the Garda, in respect of the costs arising in connection with the event. Extensive provision is also made in relation to the inspection of events and measures to ensure compliance with the conditions of a licence.</P>
    <P>Where an event is being held by a local authority, the Act provides for a public consultation procedure, following which the manager must prepare a report for the elected members on the proposal to hold the event. The members may then amend or reject the proposal. This part of the Act will commence later this year following preparation of the regulations and guidance which are necessary for its effective implementation.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for a number of measures under the national development plan of which the crime prevention programme received funding of £87 million. A sum of £46 million was allocated to prisons service training and development, £25 million to the Probation and Welfare Service and £16 million has been provided to fund a Garda youth diversion programme.</P>
      <P>The prisons service is responsible for the CONNECT prisons service project, which was developed on a pilot basis at Mountjoy Prison, the training unit and the Dóchas centre, new Women's Prison, in Dublin over the period 1998-1999. The pilot project developed methodologies for building effective linkages from custody to labour market participation after release for people in custody. During 2000, the earlier pilot project was consolidated in the three start-up prisons and preparations were made to bring the project to the other prisons in Ireland. By end 2000, just over 700 ex-offenders had participated in the programme. The number of participants who were released and secured labour market participation was 40, including four women.</P>
      <P>While the numbers entering employment immediately after release is low, my Department is confident that these placement rates will be improved on over the life of the plan. The project is being extended to five more prisons, Wheatfield and St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin, Cork and Limerick Prisons and Castlerea Prison. The total expenditure on the CONNECT project in the year 2000 was £2.1 million. Under the crime prevention measure, the Probation and Welfare Service will provide a broad range of interventions to underpin supervision of ex-offenders in the community and the construction of eleven centres. The eleven centres will provide pre-vocational training to facilitate re-entry to the labour market. The precise scheduling will be determined by the pace of local negotiations. Already a booking deposit has been paid on a property in Sligo and discussions have commenced with owners in Tallaght and Athlone.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service has also developed a linkage programme, which is a joint venture between the service and employers in Dublin and is supported by IBEC. The total expenditure by the Probation and Welfare Service under the national development plan in 2000 was approximately £311,000. The Garda youth diversion programme sub-measure is a community based crime prevention initiative and currently comprises 22 projects and this number will increase further in the current year. The total expenditure to the end of 2000 was £360,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the beginning of January, 2000, my Department also has responsibility for seven mainstreamed local drugs task force projects which come under the <Col N="1379" /> local development measure and their total budgeted cost comes to approximately £1.3 million over the life of the plan. All the projects in my Department coming under the crime prevention measure and the Garda youth diversion programme of the national development plan are subject to ongoing evaluation and monitoring and this will continue throughout the life of the plan.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): I am satisfied that my Department has in place arrangements which deal in a positive and humanitarian spirit with applications from persons who wish to be reunited with members of their family, as provided for in the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
    <P>The procedures in respect of applications from family members of persons with refugee status in the State are set out in section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996 as amended. Prior to the commencement of the Act in full by me on 20 November 2000 applications from persons with refugee status were processed by my Department on an administrative basis using section 18 as a guideline.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that a person who has been recognised as a refugee can apply to the Minister for permission to enable a member of his or her family to enter and to reside in the State. The Minister is required to refer such an application to the refugee applications commissioner for the purposes of investigating the application and submitting a report thereon. This report sets out the relationship between the refugee and the person who is the subject of the application and also deals with the domestic circumstances of the person.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain national security or public policy considerations, where on the basis of the report the Minister is satisfied that the person is a member of the family of the refugee such as a spouse or child, the Minister must grant permission to the person to enter and reside in the State. In this context the member of the family in question means the spouse of the refugee, the minor unmarried children of the refugee and, where the refugee is under the age of 18, his or her parents.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister may, at his or her discretion, grant permission to other dependant members of the family of a refugee to enter and reside in the State.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 to 108, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the accommodation of immigration detainees complies fully with the requirements of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In addition I am informed that the European Committee Against Torture did not issue an annual report in 1996.</P>
      <P>There are currently three separate provisions in Irish immigration law dealing with the detention of non-nationals by the State. They are as follows: section 5 of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended, provides for the detention of persons who have been refused leave to enter, pending the making of arrangements for their return; section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, provides for power and procedures relating to the detention of persons who are the subject of deportation orders made by the Minister, pending their removal from the State; and section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which provides for the detention of asylum applicants under certain specified circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the first two of the above instruments, there are no specific provisions relating to the conditions-regime which apply to detainees. In the case of the third instrument, the Refugee Act (Places and Conditions of Detention) Regu<Col N="1382" /> lations, 2000, it provides that persons detained under the Refugee Act in prisons will be subject to rules 189 to 213 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947. Rule 189 states that:</P>
    <P>Rules 189 to 213 apply to any person in those rules referred to as a prisoner awaiting trial committed to prison for safe custody in any of the following circumstances:&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)While awaiting trial for any indictable offence.</P>
    <P>(b)Pending the preliminary hearing before a justice of the District Court of a charge against him of an indictable offence, or pending the hearing of an information or complaint against him.</P>
    <P>(c)Awaiting sentence.</P>
    <P>(d)Aliens not under sentence who are detained under Aliens' Orders.</P>
    <P>(e)On commitment to await extradition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A copy of these rules can be made available to the Deputy if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>Immigration detainees are usually detained in either the training unit, Mountjoy Prison, Cork Prison or Limerick Prison. Where immigration detainees are held in Mountjoy Prison, they are normally separated from sentenced prisoners and are not placed in cells with convicted offenders. It is not possible at present to segregate immigration detainees from other prisoners at Cork or Limerick Prisons. In practice the majority of immigration detainees are held in the training unit, which is a drug free place of detention near Mountjoy, which operates a relatively relaxed regime within a secure perimeter. Restrictions there are kept to a minimum, consistent with order and control. Obviously in a setting like this it is impossible to keep immigration detainees separated from other prisoners.</P>

      <P>In summary, the agreement provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the readmission to Romania of persons with Romanian citizenship who are residing in the State without authorisation; the readmission of third country citizens who arrived in the State directly from Romania and who are currently residing here without authorisation; and the possibility, in limited circumstances, of third country citizens transiting either State, under escort, while being returned to a third country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The agreement sets out time limits within which requests for readmission must be made and processed and it lays down the basis on which the citizenship of a person to be readmitted can be proved to the mutual satisfaction of the contracting parties. It provides for exceptions to the readmission obligation in respect of third country citizens in certain circumstances, including where such persons have been granted refugee status or are in the process of having an asylum application considered. It also contains provisions relating to data protection and sets out the basis on which the agreement can be amended, suspended, denounced or reviewed.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, has been amended by means of an order which was made on 8 February 2001. This amendment entitles a pregnant employee who commences maternity leave at any time on or after 8 March 2001 to maternity leave consisting of 18 consecutive weeks paid leave and eight consecutive weeks unpaid leave. A woman who would be due to commence additional unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 will be entitled to avail of eight weeks unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>As the person to whom the Deputy refers is already on maternity leave, she will not be entitled to the increased period of paid leave. However, if she does not commence unpaid maternity leave until on or after 8 March, she will be entitled to apply for eight weeks unpaid leave instead of four weeks, if she wishes.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position regarding the commencement date for the increased entitlements. The Minister for Finance announced on 6 December 2000 that the increased entitlements would apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided by the annual Social Welfare Bill apply from April, or even later. After the budget announcement, officials in my Department looked into the possibility of applying the maternity leave increases not only to women who commence maternity leave from early April, but also to women who go on leave prior to that date. This issue was examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Attorney General's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that an order made under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, complies with that Act. The Attorney General advised me that it would not be possible to have the order extend the increased period of maternity leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements, that is, to employer by employee, of the parent Act and that any attempt to make the order retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge. The increases in maternity leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity benefit. They have a major impact on employers in many <Col N="1385" /> ways, for example, the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected and, in some cases, contractual obligations in respect of payment.</P>
    <P>The effective dates of the increases, as set out in the order, take account of the notice requirements under the Act. The position, therefore, is that the need to comply with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, limited the extent to which the increases could be applied to persons already on maternity leave.</P>

    <P>While this is just a snapshot of the remand prisoner population it clearly shows that the Bail Act, which I brought into operation with effect from 15 May 2000, has led to an increase in the number of those remanded in custody by the courts who are denied bail. I should point out that these figures do not include the significant number of sentenced prisoners who are also held in custody on foot of a court order pending their appearance in court at a future date.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to separate remand prisoners from convicted prisoners. A major development with respect to accommodating remand prisoners has been the opening of the new purpose built remand prison in Cloverhill. I signed a direction designating Cloverhill as a remand institution on 16 May 2000. This facilitated the transfer of remand prisoners from Mountjoy Prison, the largest penal institution in the State. Cloverhill is now the committal remand prison for the greater Dublin and Leinster areas. At full capacity it will cater for up to 406 prisoners. On 26 February 2001, 349 prisoners were in custody there. Castlerea Prison also has a purpose built remand unit where remand prisoners are contained separately from the rest of the prison population.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the prison building and refurbishment programme includes the redevelopment of large areas of Cork Prison and large areas of Limerick Prison. The provision of dedicated separate remand facilities will be part of <Col N="1386" /> these new projects which will commence later this year.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. At present the compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually and as this is an extremely time-consuming and staff intensive process it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
      <P>A new information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prisons Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database is currently being deployed across the Prisons Service. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions.</P>
      <P>While I am unable to provide the precise statistics requested, I am, however, pleased to inform the House that the number of prisoners on temporary release has continued to fall. Of the total number serving a prison sentence on Monday, 26 February 2001, only 6% were on temporary release. This figure compares with 19% in October 1996. Almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. The one exception to this is the female prisoner population for which there continues to be a shortfall in prison accommodation during peak court periods. However, this shortfall will also be addressed as the prison building programme is completed.</P>

      <P>As a direct consequence of the ongoing prison building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of temporary release of the total number of persons serving sentences from 19% in October 1996 to 6% in February 2001. The actual number on temporary release has fallen from a daily average of 550 in October 1996, to less than 200 in February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> Almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. Many of those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances.</P>
    <P>Temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. Paroles are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned re-integration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community anyway on the expiration of their sentence.</P>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served, and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public. It is unfortunately the case that, despite the most careful assessment being made in advance, certain individuals will tend to breach the trust that has been placed in them and will re-offend. Other jurisdictions, sadly, have similar experiences.</P>
    <P>When temporary release is granted it is always subject to the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour. Various other conditions may also apply. For example, the individual concerned may be subject to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station, or to reside at a particular location and so on. If any conditions are breached the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without the need for fresh proceedings.</P>
    <P>The key change in the last 12 months is that the prison system has reached the stage where it can accommodate almost all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. I qualify this statement only by reference to the female prison population where we currently have higher than anticipated committal numbers and for whom extra spaces will be built shortly.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister in 1997, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in the prison infrastructure which has virtually eliminated the unplanned release of offenders. In all, over 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way.</P>

      <P>There are currently 116 life sentence prisoners in custody. They have served various periods in prison, ranging from individuals recently committed to one particular prisoner committed in 1964. In addition, 77 offenders who were committed on life sentences are currently on release in the community. The majority of these offenders served between nine years and sixteen years in custody. In practice, most such offenders were granted renewable temporary release whereby, unless the conditions of release are breached, there is no requirement to return to prison, except to renew the temporary release at specified intervals. Offenders on renewable temporary release must be of good behaviour and remain under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached, in which event the individual concerned can automatically be returned to custody, without an additional warrant or further court proceedings.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this <Col N="1389" /> question, juvenile offenders are taken to be those under the age of 18 years. Male offenders aged 16 and 17, and up to the age of 21, may be committed, on remand or to serve a period of detention, at St. Patrick's Institution. Male offenders aged 16 and over may be committed on remand to Cloverhill Prison. Male offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand, or sentenced to imprisonment, to the five adult committal prisons &ndash; Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick, Castlerea and Portlaoise. Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the five adult committal prisons, and from St. Patrick's Institution, to Wheatfield place of detention, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.</P>
      <P>Female offenders, aged 17 years and over, may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick women's prisons.</P>
      <P>Offenders under the age of 15 years cannot be committed to prison under any circumstances. Fifteen year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances. This can occur only in cases where the court certifies, under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908, that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he-she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to segregate juvenile offenders from the general prison population in each institution at all times. The few held in the more traditional adult prisons are accommodated with other young offenders or with carefully selected older prisoners.</P>
      <P>All persons committed from the courts to institutions or prisons under the aegis of this Department are accommodated. None is refused due to limitations on accommodation.</P>
      <P>The legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 years will change on the enactment of the Children Bill, 1999, which proposes that where a court imposes a period of detention on a child, it shall, (a) where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school operated by the Department of Education and Science; and (b) where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, order the child to be detained in a place of detention provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the provisions of the Bill, separate, dedicated, secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders.</P>
      <P>The prisons building programme in relation to accommodation for children has been extended, following consultations with my ministerial colleagues, to provide the following facilities: a 40-place unit, with full support facilities, on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork Prison &ndash; planning of this project is at an advanced stage and building work will commence shortly; and a 100 place unit, with full support facilities in the Dublin region, comprising separate secure detention for up to 20 females and 80 males.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> The primary objective of these detention centres will be to afford young offenders the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to avoid future offending, by the creative design of high quality, purpose-built facilities and the provision of high grade support services, delivered through a progressive regime tailored to their special needs.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the Director General of the Prisons Service, has held discussions with the authorities responsible for the management of the young offenders' facilities at Oberstown boys and girls centres and at Trinity House, which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. These discussions related to the implications which will arise for both Departments under the Children Bill, when enacted.</P>
    <P>The director general has also briefly discussed the issue with headquarters-based officials in the Department of Education and Science. Contact has also been made with authorities in other jurisdictions and there have been site visits by prison officials to juvenile offender facilities in the USA and the UK. Officials from the architectural services division of the Office of Public Works visited the new secure juvenile unit in Scotland last summer.</P>
    <P>Discussions regarding the procurement of new facilities which will be required by my Department for juvenile offenders aged between 16 and 17 years are taking place on an ongoing basis with the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there have been no sexual offences reported to the Garda in which the use of rohypnol has been detected.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has informed me that flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in rohypnol, has been classified as a schedule 3 controlled drug in this country since 1993. As a result, unauthorised possession is an offence and rohypnol may only be obtained on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner. Doctors prescribing rohypnol must comply with the special prescription-writing requirements as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988, and the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children has written various letters to general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs. Furthermore, rohypnol should be stored in a controlled drugs cabinet in accordance with the Safe Custody Regulations, 1982.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they constantly monitor and analyse the incidence of drug misuse from the perspective of patterns and trends and that they remain vigilant with regard to the use of this particular drug.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 1284 of 30 January 2001, exemption from the study of Irish may be granted to primary pupils under the circumstances outlined in Departmental Circular 12/96. Under the terms of this circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish within the terms laid down in the circular has been vested in the individual primary school authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the circular stipulates that only pupils whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received outside Ireland would qualify for exemption from Irish on age grounds. Since the pupil for whom the exemption is being sought was less than 11 years of age on enrolment in pri<Col N="1394" /> mary school in Ireland, this pupil does not qualify for an exemption on age grounds.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to my Department, it appears that the school, in refusing to grant an exemption to this pupil under the terms of circular 12/96, has acted correctly. However, should the parents of the pupil in question wish to appeal the refusal to grant an exemption, they should write to the primary administration section of my Department in Athlone, County Westmeath. In writing to my Department the parents should provide detailed information relating to the background to this case and copies of relevant correspondence with the schools which their son has attended since returning to Ireland.</P>

      <P>In April 1999 a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who <Col N="1395" /> were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is, at least 12 months. This allowance was later approved for eligible VTOS participants, including those in receipt of an unemployment payment, one-parent family payment or disability payment, who have been in receipt of their payment for at least 12 months prior to starting VTOS. The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of long-term unemployed people in education and training programmes.

      <P>My Department is aware of the details of this case. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all pupils seeking second level places in the area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>To progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service on behalf of her child. The advice of my Department's inspectorate is being sought in this case, and every effort is being made to find a suitable school placement.</P>

      <P>My Department has carried out an assessment of the long-term enrolment projections for the area and has completed a technical examination of the two primary schools at Knocklyon. An accommodation brief is being prepared and, when this is finalised, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities. In the meantime, my Department's building unit has advised the school authorities to appoint an architect to oversee essential refurbishment works to the junior school.</P>
      <P>Owing to the large number of applications to my Department for grant aid in respect of capital works, delays in the processing of individual projects are inevitable. However, I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the pupil in the school in question will be fully considered. My Department's inspectorate has been asked to investigate the special needs of the pupil referred to by the Deputy. As soon as the inspector's report is received in my Department, the matter will be fully considered and officials of my Department will be in touch with the school authorities.</P>
