    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy to clarify the thrust of my comments during supplementary questioning on 7 March in relation to ratification of the Nice Treaty. On that occasion I indicated that there was a broad level of support for the Nice Treaty in every member state of the European Union, as indicated both in parliamentary debates and in the media. The ratification processes in other member states have begun in a number of Parliaments across the Union. I gather there is little likelihood that serious obstacles to ratification will arise. While it is not possible to be certain about the exact timetable, I understand it is expected that most member states will be in a position to ratify the treaty later this year.</P>
      <P>Even in Denmark, where it has been felt legally necessary to hold referendums on previous intergovernmental conferences, there will not be a referendum on this occasion as it has been concluded that the Treaty of Nice does not involve any extension of the EU's competences. I understand Danish parties which previously campaigned against EU treaties support the Nice Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided, on the basis of the Attorney General's advice, that a referendum is required to allow Ireland to ratify the treaty. It <Col N="486" /> is our intention to hold this referendum on 31 May, subject to the development of the foot and mouth problem, and we intend later this week to publish a Bill containing the wording of a constitutional amendment. The White Paper on the Treaty of Nice will be published tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I am glad the public will have a chance to vote on the Treaty of Nice, which, as I have often said, is intended to prepare the EU for enlargement. I have no doubt that people will express their support for enlargement. This is the right thing to do, as well as being to Ireland's practical benefit. I also have no doubt that people continue to recognise that our active membership of the EU has been, and remains, vitally important in our development as a country. While debate is welcome and important, I have yet to see any well-informed or realistic arguments put forward against the ratification of the Nice Treaty. I am disappointed by the narrow and selfish tone adopted by numerous opponents of the treaty, which is at odds with what their counterparts elsewhere are saying.</P>
    <P>In relation to my plans for official visits abroad between now and the end of July, I will attend the Gothenburg European Council on 15 and 16 June and will go on an official visit to Iceland on 25 June. I also plan to go to Brazil and Argentina on an official visit from 17 to 26 July. While detailed arrangements have yet to be finalised, it is envisaged that in addition to meetings at political level, I will have a series of business meetings to discuss trade and investment opportunities for companies. I have accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Scotland. The dates have not yet been finalised but it is expected the visit may take place in June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the Taoiseach's reply given that the Nice Treaty is a Government negotiated document. Does the Taoiseach recollect that on 7 March he gave a clear impression that most of the other EU states had already completed their approval of the Nice Treaty and that Ireland being the only EU state allowing its citizens a referendum was holding the process up? In response to my question to him, does he recall saying he did not see how anyone could say we were dealing with it in haste when most parliaments had finished with the matter? Does he not agree now that this is clearly not the case? No EU state according to the information I have received from the Commission has approved of the Nice Treaty and yet the Taoiseach says they have. Does he not agree that that was misleading this House and that on 7 March the ink was barely dry on the signatures and it would have been impossible for other states to have disposed of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The final version of the Treaty was not signed and the linguistic versions were not signed. In theory they have not yet ratified it. However, most parliaments, including the European Parliament &ndash; President Fontaine gave a <Col N="487" /> report to the European Council the other day &ndash; have had a long debate on it and it has gone through the committee system and they have come out strongly in support of it. Most parliaments have European affairs committees as we do here and it is correct to say that although the formal ratification process has not taken place they have discussed, debated and had their committee structures on the Nice Treaty. They have declared that they are not having referenda and that they support it. Technically the Deputy is correct but the reality is that the only people across Europe who have issued a word against it are the Tory euro sceptics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach cedes a technical point. I am sure, he does not wish to be interpreted as misleading the Dáil. Given the debate he mentioned that has already taken place in other countries and that we have not had extensive debate so far, does he not agree there is no mad rush on the timing of the Nice referendum? The general public need to absorb the many issues raised by Nice. Given that and the complications of adding three more non-related issues in referenda on the day, as proposed, would he not consider, particularly with the foot and mouth crisis, that the referendum might be better postponed until the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to wait to see how that develops. That might be the case. I do not rule it out but will continue to take advice from the expert group. The expert group is very close to giving its final views on the census. It looks almost certain now that the census will not take place. All those matters will have to be taken into account. I would not agree with the Deputy on the issues of the debate. I was asked by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties pre Nice that as well as having a debate in the House we should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go before the various committees, something which had not been done previously, and he did that both prior and after Nice. I have agreed to a debate in the House, at the request of the whips. There has been some discussion about having a meeting of the constitutional committee if that is considered necessary. The matter will be well and truly debated. The formal ratification process in a number of member states' parliaments will be just that. It will be a formal ratification process following the debates that have already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong view that there has been little discussion among the general public on the contents of the Nice Treaty. Will the Taoiseach accept, on foot of the statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, that a period of 30 days should elapse after the final UK case before we have the all-clear here and that it would be insensitive to embark on a national campaign until that date is arrived at? Will he further accept that confusion <Col N="488" /> on this matter serves no good? Will he also accept that four separate issues, three of which are virtually unexplained even to Members at this stage, are being taken and that a matter of weeks is not sufficient to allow an informed debate on matters of the importance that are expected to be accepted and voted on by the people at the end of May?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said what I have said about the foot and mouth disease. We will have to be guarded so no useful purpose can be served by saying any more other than that it will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on 31 May unless it is decided not to have it on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Taoiseach decide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not on 31 May, the date we have already decided on a number of weeks ago, it will be on a date after 31 May. I do not think there is any confusion about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the confusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion is that we need a platform explaining these matters to the public. This is not a matter for an in-House debate here. This is a constitutional amendment that will finally be settled&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Cabinet briefing did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It did&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it did not. The Deputy's party leader asked, even if the Attorney General stated that we did not strictly need a constitutional referendum, as other countries have indicated, based on constitutional grounds that it was not seen as an extension of the treaty, that we should have a referendum anyway, which would have been a plebiscite. I answered in the positive but time has moved on and we got the final text and the linguistic text. When the Attorney General had his first opportunity to examine it he said we were required to have a legal constitutional referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be a constitutional amendment or will it be&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a constitutional amendment based on exactly the same format as Amsterdam, as the same council advised on it. The structure which all parties agreed on at Amsterdam is exactly the same model. We went through that position before. I do not believe the <Col N="489" /> issues are complicated; in fact, they were highlighted at the end of Amsterdam and are not new issues. I would accept that the public, up and down the country, have not been debating them every night but it will not be hard to explain them. They are institutional changes for the requirements of enlargement. There are four or five points we will have to explain, for example, qualified majority voting and enhanced co-operation &ndash; a new issue introduced by the Lisbon Summit. I was asked by the Fine Gael Party to give a commitment that I would not have a referendum on the abortion issue with the other issues and that I should keep these issues together. I did that, and that was a fair argument. The public will not be confused as to whether it is for or against hanging. They will not be against the international convention about which I have been questioned. I have been ridiculed in this House by Deputy O'Keeffe who rightly asserts that we should have had it ratified last year, as there is general agreement on it. The House has debated at length the issue of lay involvement in the judicial process. If someone does not try to create mischief, there will not be any confusion. People will be in favour in the referenda here, and we will be able to explain the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the legislative programme for the referenda, starting with the publication of the White Paper on Tuesday? Will the Government introduce two Bills or a series of Bills? What will be the debating schedule for the passage of the Bills?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach overcome the constitutional issue which cast doubt on whether we can pass the Bills and then defer the referenda indefinitely or whether they have to be taken within the period set out in the constitution?</P>
      <P>In linking the date of the referenda to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, does the Taoiseach agree that the crucial issue is not the day on which voting takes place, whether 31 May or otherwise, but it is the campaign which might lead to a risk of the spread of the disease? Since the campaign will officially commence on the day the legislation is passed, is it not mandatory for the expert group to advise us within the next ten days of whether the referenda can go ahead? Does the Taoiseach agree that the campaign starts once the legislation is passed in the manner indicated by him to the Whips? Does he agree that the campaign and not the polling day is the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's questions are reasonable. The White Paper will be published tomorrow and the legislation will be published the following day. The legislation will take the form of the wording used in the poll on the Amsterdam Treaty. The legislation on these referenda will be taken between now and Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not so much the passing of the legislation but the enactment of the order. The referenda will have to take place within 90 days of the order being enacted. There will be a good <Col N="490" /> deal of flexibility. However, the Government will listen to the advice of the experts.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the experts indicated their views on the census. The Government was anxious that the census be held but the arguments for and against have been put. Unless there is some change the census will have to be put back by one year. It cannot be taken at another time because of the comparative nature of the findings.</P>
    <P>The time limit only applies from the date on which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government signs the order. I accept the Deputy's point regarding the campaign and that is the issue which has to be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the campaign commences as soon as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government signs the order? It is not a question of focusing on whether there is a case of foot and mouth disease on or around 31 May but on whether there is a case of the disease in Ireland or the UK in the last week in April. Does the Taoiseach agree that the time for a decision is upon us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the matter is not that simple. When the legislation is passed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government then signs the order. However, he does not have to sign the order immediately. Polling must take place within 90 days of the signing of the order. However, the Minister does not have to sign the order after the legislative process has been completed in the Houses. If there is still a difficulty when we finish our work we can decide on the date. If we are still in the same position we will do that. We have put a number of these issues to the expert group and it is the best way of doing it. We will take stock of the situation at the Easter break and decide what to do. I accept that we have to watch what is happening in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In a previous statement the Taoiseach took advantage of a clarification to launch a blanket attack on people who are opposed to the ratification of the Nice Treaty. Which opponents of the treaty is the Taoiseach referring to as being narrow and selfish in their approach? Does he recognise that opponents of the treaty have rational arguments? I appreciate the Taoiseach is tied into a Europe that is dominated by big multinational corporations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Taoiseach is now tied into the position of the big powers, which is to create a huge economic unit with a military wing. Is the Taoiseach aware that there is an alternative which involves a coming together of the peoples of Europe and planning their future in the interests of the majority, the environment and people's well being rather than in <Col N="491" /> super profits of the major corporations that dominate the EU at present, and the interests of the armaments industry that are lurking on the sidelines waiting to foist their trade upon an enlarged Europe? The Taoiseach should recognise that legitimate arguments can be discussed in the course of a debate rather than making a simplistic denunciation, as he has done here today.</P>
      <P>Since there are only nine weeks remaining until the end of May, will the Taoiseach name a date &ndash; which, I presume, will have to be towards the end of April &ndash; by which a final decision will be made with regard to whether there will be a referendum on 31 May? This would allow for a rational and comprehensive debate on the Nice Treaty, which might disabuse the Taoiseach of some of his erroneous opinions about people, such as those in the Socialist Party, who are opposed to the treaty but who are interNationalists, not narrow Nationalists as he is attempting to portray them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to make that decision around Eastertime, and we will do so. The purpose of the Nice Treaty is to make the necessary changes to prepare the European Union for enlargement. It does so by ensuring that a Union of 27 members will be in a position to operate effectively while, at the same time, making sure that the essential safeguards for smaller countries remain in place, as they have done since 1956. As a country that continues to benefit greatly from Community membership, it is in our interests that the Union can operate and take decisions, even with a larger membership. We had many debates on this issue in the House last year, including how the new system will operate and how we can protect our position. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. The Single Market will expand to over 500 million people and the opportunities for exporters, and people generally, are obvious. Irish companies have already demonstrated this and have moved into countries, such as Poland, which provide excellent investment opportunities through growing markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's view, and that of many others also, is that the decisions taken at Nice fully protect our essential interests. First, we achieved our priority objective whereby all decisions on taxation will continue to be made on the basis of unanimity. Second, a balanced outcome was achieved on the European Commission whereby, starting with the next Commission, the five biggest member states will give up their right to nominate a second Commissioner. There will be one Commissioner per member state, so I do not accept what Deputy Higgins said about the super powers being in a dominant position. I have almost 14 years' experience of attending European Councils and I never felt that at any time. I am sure that others who have represented Ireland at Council of Ministers' meetings over the years since 1972 have not experienced that either. I do <Col N="492" /> not know from where the Deputy obtained the notion that a number of superpowers are lurking under the table or outside the window. Quite frankly, I believe he imagined it.</P>
    <P>When the number of member states reaches 27 &ndash; this could take a decade or more to happen &ndash; a rotation system will be introduced. An important achievement in Nice was that this system will operate on the basis of strict equality. The reason for this was that some countries believed that if we were to wait to expand the number of member states to 27 at some time in the distant future, the concession on strict equality might no longer apply. Everyone was satisfied that we can operate a large Commission involving 27 countries. I have stated on many occasions in the House that I could not see how we could administer the Commission if there were 30 countries involved and if changes were not made. We argued our position at Nice and obtained a satisfactory agreement.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, an Irish commissioner will serve in exactly the same way as a French or German when the number of member states reaches 27. As part of the deal for surrendering their right to a second commissioner, the voting weight of larger states has been increased. Ireland's voting weight will be only marginally affected and, as previously, will remain the same as that of Finland and Denmark. It is also important to note that most decisions of the Commission are taken by consensus. In practice, it is rare that there is a large state-small state division on an issue.</P>
    <P>Many other arguments have been put forward. What I referred to earlier were some of the arguments put forward. For example, it has been stated that we should oppose enhanced co-operation because it might mean a two-tier Europe might be created merely because two countries might want to take action on an issue in respect of which they have reached agreement. I do not believe that argument stands up to scrutiny. In his meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, Franz Fischler has argued the benefits of this for small countries and I agree with his assertions in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the debate on this matter; I welcome it. I am sure the Deputy does not oppose my emphasising the positive aspects of it. On each occasion we have debated Europe, whether in respect of our entry in 1972, the Single European Act in 1987, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the Amsterdam Treaty in 1998 or the Nice Treaty this year, people always seem to want to debate everything that is not contained in the relevant treaties and are concerned about under the table dealings. As soon as the relevant referenda are passed, however, they state that there is no difficulty and that what went before is water under the bridge. These people then use the same erroneous arguments on the next occasion we debate a new treaty. I do not believe their behaviour is either logical or fair; it is merely represen<Col N="493" /> tative of the type of scaremongering with which we have had to contend for the past 30 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that, as my party's director of elections, I was involved in the campaigns on the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. Does he share my concern that, in light of the forthcoming change in the centre of gravity in Europe following eastern enlargement, the fact that Ireland will become more peripheral while also becoming a net contributor to the EU budget, the advent of enhanced security co-operation, reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy, the fact that Ireland will, in due course, lose its commissioner under the rotation system and that its number of MEPs will decrease, it will be more difficult on this occasion to have the referendum passed? Does the Taoiseach agree it is inappropriate to hold this referendum on the same day as three others? What is the Government's fall-back position if the referendum on the Nice Treaty is defeated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident the people will vote in favour of the referendum. Like the Deputy, I served as my party's director of elections during a number of referenda campaigns and I know he did a great deal of work during those campaigns. He will recall that people stated the world would end if the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was passed in Ireland. I was Minister for Finance at that time and remember the dire warnings of what would befall us if we passed the Maastricht Treaty. The reaction to the Amsterdam Treaty was similar. It was suggested that world super powers would force us to join world armies if that treaty was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The referendum was passed and Ireland managed to stop these huge armies from attacking us. The arguments were not well debated during the referendum campaigns of 1992 and 1998. It was hard to put the arguments to the public because some people wanted to discuss other issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, the fact that most people were focusing on the simultaneous Good Friday Agreement referendum did not do the vote on the Amsterdam Treaty any harm. On the question of relating the amendments, I said last year that we would deal with some of the issues together and keep other items separate. I gave that pledge during Question Time in the House. There are perhaps ten matters where referenda might be suitable, but only four can be dealt with immediately. Three are straightforward issues <Col N="494" /> and two are referenda where there is total agreement by all parties. There might be some debate on the third, and on the Nice Treaty referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of an internationalist party committed to the enlargement of the European Union and the deepening of functionality within the EU, I ask whether the Taoiseach agrees that it is an absolute prerequisite that we bring the people with us? Does the Taoiseach agree that we have failed to adequately debate the EU at community level in Ireland? Does the Taoiseach also agree that we have allowed the misinformation which he has mentioned to dominate debate rather than allowing for engagement on the issues that are to be put to the people?</P>
      <P>Being aware of the history that the Taoiseach alluded to, does he not accept that it is irresponsible at this juncture in EU history to require this debate to take place against the backdrop of the foot and mouth disease outbreak? Communities, and rural communities in particular, are focused on this issue. Does the Taoiseach agree that rural communities will not thank him for expecting them to engage in such an important debate, which the Taoiseach has conceded is not urgent, at a time when minds are fixed on individual and national economic survival? Does he agree that it is appropriate for this debate to be launched but for the decision to be reserved until the autumn when there can be a clear focus and a proper debate involving all citizens?</P>

      <P>I have answered the question but I will do so again. We are asking that the legislative process on this matter be put in place prior to Easter. At that stage the decision will be made whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government moves the order which would mean a referendum must take place within 90 days. That decision does not have to be made now. We are anxious to get the legislation, the White Paper, and the issues into the public domain. In the absence of that&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is necessary to repeat myself several times. The Government has decided, on the Attorney General's advice, that a referendum is required to allow Ireland to ratify the Nice Treaty. It is our intention to hold this referendum on 31 May 2001, subject to the development of the foot and mouth problem. We intend to publish the Bill containing the constitutional amendment and the White Paper long before any campaign. At the latest, in three or four weeks we will make a decision about the order.

If there was a campaign it would only be through the month of May but let us get all the information out, including the shortened version of the White Paper, the legislation and the debates here so that we can talk about the real issues.

Can he say whether there is any change? He mentioned earlier that the Amsterdam Treaty model is the one that will be followed. Does that imply there is no change? Second, will the Taoiseach accept that nobody maintained the world would end after the Maastricht or Amsterdam Treaties but that certain controls over our finances would end? Will he accept that is the case? Third, will the Taoiseach agree it is somewhat ironic that while he cites the business opportunities in other countries, the foot and mouth disease crisis is being exacerbated by the difficulty of trying to curtail the spread of the disease which, in many cases, is due to transportation in the agricultural sector? Will he accept there is a need to re-examine whether agricultural produce can be more locally <Col N="496" /> produced, notwithstanding the trends of globalisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      <P>In reply to the first question, we had long discussions here between the parties on the last occasion during which we agreed on a model, and we are sticking with that model. There is no change. On neutrality, we are a neutral country and we are not into any scales.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the people, including myself, who are in favour of enlargement, not just for the sake of additional wealth within Europe but for the sake of peace and stability in an enlarged Europe, are genuinely concerned about the attitude of some of the larger member states regarding the role of smaller states in Europe. Does he agree that if the United States of America can find a way to have two Senators for every state, irrespective of their size, larger states within Europe must recognise that smaller states must be properly represented if we are to have a proper Union? For that reason, does he accept the view expressed by Deputy Gay Mitchell, which I share, that a referendum on such a serious issue, which probably will be the most important referendum we hold on a European issue, should be held on its own, that we should have a proper debate and that people who have genuine fears should be <Col N="497" /> allowed to express them so that we send a message to the larger states that the role of the smaller state must be recognised? Although I will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I would like my voice to be heard by other Europeans that there is a role for the smaller state and that there comes a point where enough is enough. This debate is important. Those of us, including myself, who will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; would like to have the opportunity to let that message be known throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>As regards the shareholding for Aer Lingus employees in the context of the IPO, significant progress was made last summer on this issue in discussions with the Aer Lingus unions. However, these discussions were not concluded as a consequence of the industrial relations difficulties in the airline. Officials from my Department will contact the Aer Lingus unions in the near future with a view to resuming discussions on the shareholding for Aer Lingus employees.</P>

Ownership of Aer Lingus shares will be restricted following the IPO.

Under the provisions of section 7 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, my approval, together with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is required for such payment.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the agreement negotiated between the board of CIE and the former chief executive that the terms of his retirement remain confidential between himself and CIE.

Given that the Minister's approval is sought for such deals, will she insist that there will not be any confidentiality clauses in such deals in future involving public money or where the State pays for chief executives of State companies or for people in other public positions?

      <P>The Government has given an explicit commitment to the retention of the rural sub-post office network in the White Paper on Rural Development. I have also publicly indicated my firm support for this policy on numerous occasions. It was in this context that I asked Mr. Phil Flynn in February last year to assist An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union to progress discussions in which these parties were engaged under the partnership process regarding the future of the post office network.</P>
      <P>I have received Mr. Flynn's report and it will be on the Cabinet agenda next Tuesday. In his excellent report, which I will make available, Mr. Flynn outlines the serious financial difficulties facing An Post, together with a wide range of scenarios, options and recommendations to guarantee the future viability of the network. I will announce what action I propose to take on foot of the report when the Cabinet has completed its deliberations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply. Will she confirm that £70 million will be required between 2000 and 2005 to keep rural post offices open? Is it true the Minister for Finance strongly opposes any subvention to the post office network? When the Minister goes to Government, will she seek that £70 million over the years 2000 to 2005?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Finance are, by their nature, opposed to spending and that has nothing to do with the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the previous one, Deputy Quinn, or whoever is Minister for Finance. The minute they become Minister, they become disposed to minding the nation's money, and rightly so. That has always been the case with any Minister for Finance with whom I have dealt and the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is no different. He should be commended, not criticised, for that.</P>
      <P>The details of Mr. Flynn's report were printed in great detail in a national newspaper and the Deputy's comments are based on that. I cannot go into detail until I bring the matter to Cabinet next Tuesday. I can say that it does not just involve the rural network. People have the idea that if all small rural post offices were closed in one fell swoop, the financial difficulties which beset the post office network would be cured at a stroke. However, that is not the case. As Mr. Flynn pointed out, many of the large urban post offices have the same difficulties. Definite proposals must be worked out for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Government gave a commitment in the White Paper and I am committed to this area. I have no time for people who say that some of the smaller post offices are unnecessary. However, I wish more people used rural post offices. I have spoken to people who were worried about the possible closure of the local post office because nobody wanted to take it on, but when I asked them if they used the post office, it emerged that some of them had never <Col N="507" /> been in it. There must be some flexibility from others. The matter will be on the Cabinet agenda next Tuesday and the report will be made public that day or the following day. I hope it will engender a lively debate.</P>

      <P>I have not discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance or the Government but post offices have a long and good history of involvement in savings. In the past people had post office savings books and other banking facilities. However, I am wary of banks taking the easy way out by deciding to give some of their business to post offices to enable them to close some of their operations. That would not be a good development because it would make it too easy to close operations. However, a price would be involved if a bank is definite about closing a local branch and asks An Post to take on many of its services. Such moves may help in terms of the future viability of post offices.</P>

      <P>The INPC signed a non-binding heads of agreement with Tosco Corporation on 28 July 2000 regarding the potential sale of INPC's refining and storage operations to the US company. Since then, INPC and Tosco Corporation have been engaged in negotiations with a view to agreeing the detailed terms of the transaction. My Department, together with the Department of Finance, has been involved in the process as have our legal and financial advisers, Matheson Ormsby Prentice and Arthur Andersen, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> These negotiations are at an advanced stage. However, no undertakings have been entered into by any party to the proposed transaction. I assure the House that no binding commitments will be made in relation to the disposal of these facilities unless I am satisfied that the proposed transaction is fully acceptable. Furthermore, as I stated in replies to previous questions on this issue, I expect to bring legislation before the House to underpin any functions I may be required to perform on behalf of the State in the matter.</P>
    <P>Part of the proposed sale involves a commitment by Tosco Corporation to continue to operate the facilities in question for at least 15 years. This would involve, for example, undertaking any investment at the Whitegate refinery necessary to satisfy the requirements of the EU Auto Oil II Programme which are expected to come into effect in 2005. These requirements have yet to be finalised and it is not possible at this stage to estimate the extent of the investment that this and-or any subsequent environmentally based legislation will entail.</P>
    <P>It is also anticipated that Tosco Corporation will consider other developments at the refinery, subject to commercial evaluation. If the transaction goes ahead, the extent and scheduling of any such investment would be a matter for Tosco Corporation.</P>

The European directives that govern transfers of undertakings and other directives will apply in this case.

For example, we are aware of what happened regarding the binding letters given to TEAM Aer Lingus employees that stated they would have jobs for life.

      <P>The current proposals for the development of the Dublin light rail system are materially different from the 1996 proposal. The current proposal comprises three lines and will serve a wider catchment area than the original. It involves lines from Tallaght to Abbey Street, Abbey Street to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996, a number of changes to the scope of the project have been introduced. These changes include the extension of line B from Dundrum to Sandyford, the preparation of the Sandyford-St. <Col N="510" /> Stephen's Green line for upgrade to metro, a new line C from Abbey Street to Connolly Station and alterations to plans for road junctions and bridge works. Revised costs at current prices for the project are now being finalised and the latest projected figures are estimated at over £500 million to the planned completion date for the works in 2003.</P>
    <P>The development of the light rail project is being undertaken in accordance with EU public procurement rules involving public tendering for all aspects of the project. Apart from changes in the scope of the project, the biggest single factor contributing to cost increases has been the change in the bidding climate due to the effect of inflation on tender pricing. All infrastructure development projects have experienced similar increases in the past few years where inflation related to construction has far exceeded the normal rate. The light rail project office of CIE has carried out value engineering exercises in order to keep cost increases to the minimum while ensuring, at the same time, that the expected high quality of the light rail service is not compromised.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the fact that a cost benefit analysis carried out on the project, based on the revised costs, found that the case for the lines remains robust.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister accept that when she became Minister in 1997, she inherited a ready to roll Luas system and while changes were introduced in the meantime, the core project is essentially the same? Will she accept that if the project had not been delayed at that stage and if people had not gone back to the drawingboard, the project would now be completed? Is she aware the exact same light rail system was planned and conceived from Montpellier in France at the same time as Luas in 1996-97 and it is now up and running and providing a service? Apart from a bit of digging around Heuston Station and other areas, Luas is largely a drawingboard project. Will she accept that is the fundamental reason the project has now gone from its original projected cost of in the region of £250 million to the astronomical figure of £500 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a drawingboard project because the construction team has been accepted and the work has begun.

There had been no public hearings at that stage.</P>

The <Col N="511" /> public hearings took a certain length of time and Judge Seán O'Leary was excellent in dealing quickly with the issue. There is an extension of the line from Dundrum to Sandyford, the preparation of the Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green line for upgrade to metro and a new line C. There have been huge inflationary increases in construction. Inflation in regard to road construction is huge and is much greater than in the case of this project. This is a good project and I wish to say well done to Deputies Lowry and Dukes for the work they put into the preparation of the project.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this was a Labour Party project and it is now one of her great failures? Given that she was handed the project on a plate, will she agree that but for the opposition of the Progressive Democrats at the time, she would have proceeded with the project as planned? Will she further agree that the scheme which is now being proposed is simply a face saver for her, with one last leg of Luas left from Tallaght to Connolly Station and the Sandyford line development being used for a different type of trade? The Minister said the cost of the project will be at least £500 million for a small piece of the original Luas. There will be no tunnel and none of the grandiose plans she said were essential when she came into office. Will she now accept that she should abandon Luas altogether because it is no longer a viable project? One leg of a planned system for the whole city is all that is left. Will she agree she should abandon the project and use the money where it can be effective in solving Dublin's traffic problems?</P>

        <b>: </b>At the recent press conference, reference was made to the fourth report of the Light Rail Advisory Action Group stating that a lack of inter-agency co-operation is now putting the project at risk, about which the Minister expressed anxiety. Has there been any progress in that regard? Is it a fact that the report <Col N="512" /> specifically mentioned delays over the relocation of facilities at St. James's Hospital and roadworks in south County Dublin and the Long Mile Road to facilitate the Tallaght Luas line? Mr. Pádraig White is quoted as saying that these difficulties arise from funding problems. Will the Minister elaborate on what precisely is meant by funding problems in overcoming those issues?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. The report mentioned inter-agency difficulties. I am not sure to what the funding related. I understood it related to the hospital having to move its facilities which would clearly be funded by Luas. There were internal funding arrangements, not related to Luas but to some of the agencies. The Deputy is correct in relation to the hospital but other agencies were involved. As I understand it, since these issues were made public, the agencies have responded.</P>

      <P>The RPII has been maintaining contact with the UK Nuclear Installation Inspectorate (NII) regarding the safety improvement recommendations contained in the RPII's report of December 2000 concerning the storage of high level waste at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The RPII has been informed by BNFL that it has carried out a number of actions on the safety improvement recommendations contained in the RPII report. The analysis of the risk of damage as a result of a severe accident has been substantially completed and some system improvements have been identified. BNFL has discussed and agreed the proposed system improvements with the NII and a programme has been established for their implementation.</P>
      <P>BNFL has informed the RPII that a programme for the random checking of plant personnel for alcohol and drug abuse will be introduced at all BNFL installations from 1 April 2001. The RPII has also been informed by BNFL that a new procedure has been introduced which will reduce substantially the risk of hydrogen build-up in the high level radioactive waste tanks. Purging equipment has been installed and routine purging of the tanks with compressed air is being carried out. A number of improvements to the tanks cooling water systems have been identified and agreed with the NII. Some improvements have also been made to the data reliability of components and more will follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> The response by BNFL to the RPII recommendations has been positive to the extent that several improvements have been made and work is still ongoing. The improvements carried out by BNFL to date are a direct result of the RPII's examination of the BNFL safety documentation relating to the storage of the high level waste and endorses the significance and importance of the RPII's examination. I have requested the RPII to keep me informed of any further improvements carried out by BNFL on foot of the RPII report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome the progress made. However, I would have liked him to be more specific about the number of recommendations which have been acted on. Does the Minister agree that the public profile of the Government on the issue of Sellafield has been somewhat reduced of late and it is important that we keep this issue to the fore in our contacts with the British Government at Minister of State, departmental and Taoiseach level? Does he agree this high level of contact is desirable and that we should continue to seek peer examination rather than depending on the British to tell us what is happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments and agree that getting this exercise done by the RPII was a major achievement. We have long endeavoured to get inside the doors of BNFL to carry out our risk assessment exercise. I acknowledge Deputy Stagg's efforts in this regard. It was only through dogged persistence by the Government that we managed to get the RPII to carry out this exercise. This portrays the Government's unabated efforts to deal with Sellafield and its desire to have the reprocessing and other activities at Sellafield terminated. Twelve months ago the Taoiseach publicly called for the closure of the installations at Sellafield. He has kept this issue to the fore in his contacts with the UK Prime Minister, as I do at Minister of State level. It is also kept to the fore at official level on an ongoing basis in the fora available to us. This is the most important issue and continues to be treated as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this highly active liquid waste is the greatest risk to Ireland from the British nuclear industry? Given the slipshod methods used by British officialdom which have given us mad cow disease, CJD and foot and mouth disease, does the Minister agree he has no confidence in its methods of controlling this area which is of high risk to us and that there is a danger of a big bang and a chain reaction from one of the storage tanks which will put foot and mouth, CJD and mad cow disease in the halfpenny place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>My confidence and that of all Members in the efficiency and safety standards in Sellafield has been long shaken. I agree this high level waste has been one of the main causes of <Col N="514" /> concern to successive Governments over the years. This item has been at the top of the list for discussion at every meeting at ministerial and official level. The British authorities have referred to a process of vitrification which will take until 2015 to conclude. We have repeatedly exhorted the British authorities to expedite this process and to take whatever technical measures can be taken. When their independent inspectorate carried out its exercise last February it found major faults and safety lapses. It highlighted this issue and insisted that the timeframe be adhered to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of cross-Border rail links, including the scope for improved services between Dublin and Derry, was discussed at the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on transport on 19 December last. The meeting was jointly chaired by the First Minister, David Trimble, and Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon.</P>
      <P>The council identified a number of opportunities for co-operation, including the further development of cross-Border rail and bus services, and asked that the joint secretariat would convene meetings of officials to prepare a detailed work programme for consideration at a future meeting of the council.</P>
      <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that Northern Ireland Railways plans to reduce travel times between Derry and Belfast by routing trains on to the Antrim-Bleach Green line, which is a more direct route to Belfast than the current route via Lisburn. When the line is brought into use, the Derry train will terminate at Belfast central station, thus allowing for direct connections with the Enterprise services to Dublin. This development will greatly enhance rail travel opportunities between Donegal, Derry and Dublin.</P>
      <P>When we had that meeting I asked Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon directly about that service. It is too early yet for Iarnród Éireann to consider a direct Dublin-Derry service. Apart from the rolling stock issue there are local concerns in Northern Ireland about the main routing north of Belfast. It is a live issue and is on the agenda.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and for the important role she played in getting air access into Derry from Dublin. Could she confirm again what she has said, that it is vital to get rail access into Donegal whether it be to Derry or to Donegal? Has the Minister any time scale from the Northern authorities in relation to the upgrading of the Derry to Belfast stretch of the line? When that section is upgraded the Minister should push for the Enterprise to go from Dublin straight through to Derry. There should not be any reason we have a faster track and a train from Derry stopping in Belfast so that people can get on to the Enterprise. There should be a through train and this suggestion does not seem to pose a huge problem.</P>

      <P>It is now anticipated that it will be May or June before the direct service is introduced. Trains operating on the new line would terminate at Belfast central. The issue is still very <Col N="518" /> alive on the agenda of the North South Ministers with responsibility for transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all do constituency work and, a fortnight ago, a 25 year old person came to me who had paid £2,300 for insurance last year. This year the premium rose to £2,700 even though there had not been any accidents. Will the Taoiseach join me in condemning what appears to be a rip-off of under 25 year olds, women and old age pensioners by the insurance industry? The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has found that drivers between the ages of 18 and 25 are now, contrary to conventional wisdom, the most profitable motor insurance risk; that women drivers are paying far more than they should be; and that old age pensioners, who are considered a high risk category by the insurance industry, are actually one of the profitable categories. Will the Taoiseach condemn these practices? Will he ensure that the Tánaiste brings forward the full report without delay? Will both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have immediate consultations with representatives of the insurance industry to bring car insurance rates down to what they should be so that the industry would get moderate profits and the rip-off that has been going on for years will stop?</P>

At a recent meeting of the relevant Oireachtas committee, representatives of the industry were still maintaining that the provision of insurance cover for this category of young driver was a loss-making exercise from the point of view of the industry and that that was one of the reasons premia rates were so high.</P>

The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which the Government established, and the Personal Injuries Advisory Board are there to try to bring down insurance costs. I note what Deputy Noonan said about the Government's efforts &ndash; including <Col N="524" /> efforts made by myself, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy &ndash; to try to obtain more action in this area. However, given recent figures in the category referred to, it would appear that the insurance industry is not making any profit and has not done so for some years. That is what lies behind the contention it has made.</P>

      <P>Those figures are in dispute. The Minister will outline the reasons behind that on the Adjournment later this evening, but over the past six to nine months the figures have not been agreed to by the industry. The Government established the Personal Injuries Advisory Board. One may well ask why it was not set up years ago, but it has been established to deal with the issue of personal injuries, whence this dilemma has arisen. We established the board to tackle that matter. Given the arguments and facts that have been put forward regarding such cases, for a long time, personal injury claims involving young people have been enormous and insurance policies have not been profit-making ventures.

      <P>As a former Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach is no doubt aware that since 1983 it has been a criminal offence for any person who, under section 94(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Finance Act, 1983, knowingly aids, abets, assists, incites or induces another person to make or deliver knowingly or wilfully any incorrect return, statement or accounts in connection with any tax. In light of this part of our law and the judgment made last Friday, does the Taoiseach believe the continued membership of Dáil Éireann by one of his Deputies is now tenable?</P>

      <P>In connection with the issue raised by Deputy Quinn, has the Taoiseach had any conversation at all with Deputy Cooper-Flynn since the adjudication on her court case last Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Noonan's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I have also been in receipt of private correspondence from Deputy Cooper-Flynn. She has also informed me that she has tendered her resignation as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn for the service she has rendered to the House as a member of that committee. I also thank her for making a wise choice in putting the interests of the committee ahead of her own interests, and for the promptness of her action which has served this House and the committee by preventing them from becoming involved in further controversy. As I said yesterday, that was the appropriate action for her to take and it is welcome.</P>
      <P>The context in which Deputy Cooper-Flynn has tendered her resignation from the committee concerns the outcome last week of the defamation proceedings which she took in the High Court. I understand from Deputy Cooper-Flynn that the case will be heard in the court on this day week. She will then have a period during which to appeal the case, or not. She has informed me that she and her legal team will make a fairly prompt decision based on her legal advice. I have been informed that once the costs are determined, a decision on the appeal will be made. It would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on the outcome of the proceedings at this stage, given that the matter may yet be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>There should be no doubt about my position on general principles. Deputy Quinn asked me about the principles that are enunciated in legislation which has been passed by the House. As a former Minister for Finance, I was responsible for putting much of the legislation in this area before the House in the Finance Act, 1992. Tax evasion is wrong and encouraging others to engage in tax evasion is equally wrong. Legislators and institutions, public or private, are all bound as good citizens to observe and uphold the rule of law. As stated previously, the action of some banks and their employees in encouraging and facilitating tax evasion, as established by the DIRT inquiry, was reprehensible. The days when individuals or corporate bodies, however high their public standing, could afford to adopt a cavalier attitude to the tax laws are long gone. It would save a great deal of pain if, in future, everyone recognised that and obeyed the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn took a civil action in relation to defamation and we are aware of the outcome. Like everyone else, the Deputy is neither above nor below the law. I believe, as do the majority of Members of the House, that she is entitled to due process and full accountability. <Col N="526" /> I wish her well in whatever decision she is obliged to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said. Does he not agree that on Friday last a jury of the High Court found, as a matter of fact, that Deputy Cooper-Flynn, acting in her capacity as an official of a bank, clearly incited or encouraged people to break the law by not paying their tax? The Taoiseach has applauded her decision to resign forthwith from the Committee of Public Accounts. Given that a jury has found that, as a matter of fact, the law was broken on foot of incitement, what does the Taoiseach believe Deputy Cooper-Flynn should do? Does he believe that her continued membership of Dáil Éireann, this place of law-making, is tenable?</P>

      <P>Anyone who takes a case to the High Court and does not obtain the result they desire is entitled to consider the legal implications. In this instance, Deputy Cooper-Flynn is entitled to do so under due process. I have outlined the circumstances in which she has indicated that she will make that decision. The Deputy is entitled to take time to consider her position. We are led to believe that the legal costs involved in this case are enormous and that the Deputy will go before the courts next week in respect of that matter. She has informed me and others in my party that she will make a fairly quick decision, based on the legal advice she receives, when the matter of costs is decided and she is entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht againn ag céim an choiste mar gheall ar an sainmhíniú seo. An locht a fuair mé ar an sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;theaghlach&rdquo; atá sa Bhille ná go bhfuil sé ró-oscailte agus ró-leathan. De réir mar  atá an sainmhíniú sa Bhille mar atá, d'fhéadfadh daoine atá ina gcónaí le chéile i dteach an teideal teaghlach a ghlacadh de réir mar atá an sainmhíniú ag an nóiméad. Is é atá uaim ná go mbeadh srian éigin leis an míniú. Cuirim i gcás lánúin nach bhfuil pósta agus a bhfuil cónaí orthu i dteach. Ní hiad sin atá i gceist agam. Ach de réir an tsainmhínithe atá anseo, d'fhéadfadh duine, beirt nó triúr, mar shampla, a bheith i lóistín i dteach agus gan ach coinníoll amháin le comhlíonadh acu agus is é sin ná go mbeadh Gaeilge acu.</P>
      <P>Má fhéachann an tAire ar na sainmhínithe sa Roinn Comhshaoil nuair a bhíonn siadsan ag plé le deontais agus araile, ní dóigh liom go bhfeicfidh sí sainmhíniú mar atá anseo do theaghlach. Ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil sainmhíniú chomh leathan agus chomh hoscailte leis seo ag teastáil.</P>

      <P>Go bunúsach baineann an leasú seo leis an sainmhiniú ar &ldquo;theaglach&rdquo; in Alt 2. Tuigim go bhfuil i gceist ag an Teachta cungú a dhéanamh ar an sainmhiniú reatha ionas nach mbeadh i gceist ach daoine a bhfuil gaol fola nó cleamhnais acu leis an áititheoir nó daoine ach atá i gcaidreamh atá comhchosúil le gaol fola nó cleamhnais leis an áititheoir. Is mian liom a chur in iúl go bhfuil an sainmhiniú seo ar &ldquo;theaghlach&rdquo; bainteach le Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) amháin agus tá an sainmhiniú seo in úsáid ó 1929 i leith agus ní raibh deacrachtaí leis. Is deontais do thithe atá i gceist faoi na hAchtanna agus ní foláir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga theaghlaigh ins an teach sin. Chuige sin caithfear cumas Gaeilge gach duine sa teaghlach a chur san áireamh nuair atá deontais á meas. D'fhéadfadh daoine a bheith ina ngnáthchónaí sa teach nach bhfuil gaol fola nó cleamhnais acu leis an áititheoir nó nach bhfuil i gcaidreamh atá comhchosúil le gaol fola nó cleamhnais leis an áititheoir &ndash; mar shampla, cairde nó cónaitheoiri fad-téarmacha &ndash; agus bheadh tionchar ag na daoine seo ar theanga labhartha an tí. Tá sé fior-thábhachtach ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht de go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga an teaghlaigh sula níoctar deontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht). Mar sin, ní foláir go mbeadh brí níos leithne ag an sainmhiniú ná an sainmhiniú atá molta ag an Teachta agus go gcludódh an sainmhiniú gach duine atá ina ghnáthchónaí sa teach sin.</P>
      <P>Uaireanta bíonn cúinsí speisialta ag baint le cásanna (mar shampla, duine in árásán sa teach nach bhfuil baint aige/aici leis an lion tí nó duine atá sa teach go gearrthéarmach) agus cuirtear cúinsí mar seo san áireamh agus an t-iarratas á mheas.

Glacaim leis go bhfuil an sainmhíniú seo ann ó 1929 agus nach raibh aon trioblóid leis. Ní haon deimhniú é sin nach mbeidh trioblóid amach anseo ach nílim chun an leasú seo a bhrú mar tá sé soiléir nach n-éireodh liom.

      <P>Go bunúsach cuireann an leasú seo deireadh leis an aidhin atá sa Bhille chun sainmhiniú amháin a chur i bhfeidhm do Limistéir na Gaeltachta agus ag an am céanna déanann sé iarracht na cumhachtaí faoin Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956 a aistriú go dti an Roinn Ealaion, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oilean.</P>
      <P>Mar a mhinigh mé cheana, measaim go bhfuil an-tábhacht ag baint le hAlt 3 den Bhille mar atá sin é, chun a leagan amach gurb i an Ghaeltacht chun críocha na nAchtanna ná na Limistéir Oifigiúla Ghaeltachta a shonraitear faoin Acht Airi agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956. Ta sé thar am anois an leasú riaracháin a dhéanamh chun deireadh a chur le seanlimistéir 1929 i gcás Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus teacht i gcomhréir leis na Limistéir Oifigiúla Gaeltachta a leagadh síos 6 1956 i leith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, bhí limistéir an-mhóra i gceist i dtosach faoi Acht 1929 agus cé gur gearradh siar orthu i 1959, tá na hAchtanna fós ag plé leis na Limistéir Oifigiúla Gaeltachta Leasú 2 ar lean . . . (cosúil le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, mar shampla) chomh maith le Limistéir Ghaeltachta <Col N="533" /> eile lasmuigh dóibh sin a leagadh síos faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) 1929 ages nach bhfuil i bhfeidhm mar &ldquo;Ghaeltacht&rdquo; in aon réimse eile. Caithfimid a bheith réalaíoch nach Gaeltachtaí iad na ceantair imeallacha seo i Limistéir Achta 1929 a thuilleadh ar aon bhealach ages nach mbíonn ach líon beag cásanna i gceist faoi Achtanna na dTithe ins na limistéir sin. Aon deontas nua a tugadh isteach faoi Achtanna na dTithe tar éis 1956, mar shampla, teach nua do dhuine gan teach, méadú speisialta do chuairteoirí nó ceann tuí a athnuachan, bhí siad teoranta do na Limistéir Oifigiúla a leagtar síos faoin Acht Airí ages Rúnaithe (Leasú) 1956.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá agus a threisiú anseo go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag Alt 3 den Bhille seo an Ghaeltacht a láidriú ages beidh an doras ar oscailt i gcónaí chun chur leis an Ghaeltacht trí orduithe faoin Acht Airí ages Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcuid sin den leasú a bhaineann le cumhachtaí bainteach leis na Limistéir Ghaeltachta a athrú go dtí an Roinn, ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl gar leagadh síos faoin Acht Airí ages Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956 go mbeadh an chumhacht ag an Rialtas chun na Limistéir Ghaeltachta a shonrú trí orduithe faoin Acht sin. Silím go bhfuil an socrú seo an-oiriúnach mar go mbaineann an ghné seo le mór-polasaithe náisiúnta na tíre. Dár ndóigh freisin, baineann an Bille seo le tithíocht sa Ghaeltacht amháin ages ní ghabhann an leasú seo le spiorad an Bhille áirithe seo.</P>
    <P>Is féidir go mbeidh tuairimí ages moltaí suimiúla ó Choimisiún na Gaeltachta mar gheall ar na Limistéir Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Faoi dheireadh ba mhaith liom a rá nach mbeadh aon deacracht ag an Roinn orduithe breise a fháil déanta faoin Acht Airí ages Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956 má bhíonn cás láidir arm chun a leithéid a dhéanamh. Nil sé i gceist agam glacadh leis an leasú seo.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Aire Stáit i ngeall ar an bhfreagra sin ach b'fhéidir nach dtuigeann sí mo phointe i gceart. Ar an gcéad dul síos níl aon rud agam i gcoinne an deacracht atá ann idir na teorainneacha a bhí ann i 1929 agus an leasú a tháinig i 1956. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé sin leasaithe sa Bhille seo. Ach, cuirim i gcás nuair a thiocfaidh tuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta chugat, b'fhéidir go mbeidh moltaí ann ar láimh amháin an Ghaeltacht a leathnú agus, b'fhéidir, ar an láimh eile, í a chúngú. Dá mbeadh na cumhachtaí seo i Roinn nGaeltachta thiocfadh an t-ordú amach i bhfad níos tapúla ná mar a bheadh an scéal má bhíonn na cumhachtaí fós i Roinn an Taoisigh. I ndeireadh na dála an rud atá uaim ná go mbeadh na cumhachtaí go léir a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht i Roinn amháin, sé sin an Roinn ina a bhfuil an tAire Stáit anois. An bhfuil aon rud níos bunúsaí i dtaobh na Gaeltlachta ná teorainneacha na Gaeltachta?</P>

Tuigim an rud atá á rá ag an Teachta, sé sin nach ceart go mbeadh cumhachtaí ar chóir a bheith againnne taobh amuigh den Roinn, mar shampla rudaí tábhachtacha a bhaineann le Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1: </P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) As soon as may be after the end of each year beginning with the year in which this Act is passed, the Minister shall prepare and lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report setting out the measures taken to rehabilitate sex offenders, including the rehabilitation of offenders in custody, and shall specify the number of such offenders, the number who applied for or sought to avail of such measures, and the number to whom such measures were provided.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that as soon as the Act is passed the Minister lays before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out the measures taken to rehabilitate sex offenders, including measures taken while the offenders are in custody. We want to ensure that we focus not just on the establishment of a register, but also on the broader aspects, such as the treatment of sex offenders while in custody and subsequent to their release. I want to ensure that the public is given information on a regular basis about progress in this regard. At present, there is limited treatment of sex offenders while in custody. The Arbour Hill provision has been there for some time. Perhaps the Minister could outline the progress being made on the proposals for the Curragh prison. The most recent statistics show that only five of the 80 sex offenders released from prison in 1999 had taken part in the appropriate prescribed treatment programme. While I acknowledge there are other forms of treatment, this specific programme is designed for sex offenders. This shows that many people who go to prison for such offences do not undergo any type of treatment.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for a court to order a released prisoner to attend counselling under the probation and welfare service. I do not accept the argument that we cannot compel a person to do something while in custody. We must ensure every effort is made to encourage such offenders to have the appropriate treatment. Most of them are in denial about their behaviour and, therefore, they are not likely to voluntarily look for treatment. There is an obligation on the State and on the courts to ensure that every effort is made to encourage those who have offended the public and individuals to face up to what they have done and to get whatever treatment is available.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to ensure this issue is debated in the wider context of provision, both within prison and subsequent to release from prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment. The lack of treatment facilities for sex abusers puts children at risk. This has been stated by Dr. Margo Anglim, a child psychiatrist who works with adolescent offenders in the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin. The only facility outside prisons for sex abusers is the Granada Institute, a private fee-paying agency. Treatment is effective in reducing re-offending. Ms Rhonda Turner, a psychologist with the St. Louis unit, Dublin, has said that appropriate treatment facilities for adolescent abusers are urgently needed. She has stated that half of the adult sexual abusers began their abuse during adolescence. Recent research indicated that about 25% of adolescent abusers began abusing at a very young age.</P>
      <P>In 1999, there were 88 sex offenders released after completion of their sentences and 117 were released in 2000. Five of those released in 1999 and six of those released in 2000 had completed the specialised sex offenders group treatment programme in Arbour Hill. One hundred years ago it was accepted practice to turn the key and lock away criminals. Nowadays, terms such as treatment and therapy are being embraced by the prison service as the tools with which to achieve prisoner rehabilitation. The ultimate goal is to protect society once these people are released.</P>
      <P>When prisoners are in the care of the State, there is a moral and legal obligation to attempt to rehabilitate them. Anything less is a denial of the State's responsibility. This month's official figures indicate that 362 convicted sex offenders are in prison. The Arbour Hill programme admits ten prisoners per year through a strict selection programme. Staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform operate the programme. Those who work within the prison system believe sex offenders in prison could be guided on a clear path, but most do not get that chance. The Department uses phrases like &ldquo;you cannot force prisoners to apply&rdquo;, but they are given no real incentive. It should be tied to the granting of remission and it should be ensured that more prisoners are motivated to apply. Many prison officers feel frustrated that they are not being trained to deliver supervised sex treatment courses. This is a model used in other European countries which would allow a programme to expand. It is unacceptable to lock up sex offenders, fail to provide treatment and then release them into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland it is estimated that about 5% of boys and 7% of girls are sexually abused before the age of 16 years. The estimate for physical abuse is put at somewhere between 8% and 12% of children. The characteristics of a person who sexually abuses children vary, depending on the relationship. Therefore, the rehabilitative programme and the chances of rehabilitation will vary, depending on the same characteristics. If the abuser is a stranger to the child, he is generally a loner, a single man with no history of being in a marital relationship. These abusers will sexually <Col N="538" /> assault the child once and move on to other victims. They will accumulate a number of victims and have been known to claim as many as 200 to 300. There is one type of programme to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Another type of sexual offender is a parent or relative who abuses a child. This type of abuse is more amenable to rehabilitative treatment. Such offenders do not have many victims and are not usually violent. They persuade the child to accept the abuse over a long period. They convince the child that such abuse is a game or is educational. They persuade them it is not harmful. In most cases, they live in the same household as the child. Between these two types, there is the person who is known to the child but does not necessarily live in the same house. These abusers may have a number of victims at any one time, or sequentially. These three groups of offenders show different responses to rehabilitation and programmes should be structured to reflect these differences.</P>
    <P>All sex offenders have low self-esteem, low sense of self worth and little understanding of their victims' position. Surely a rehabilitative programme can work on these characteristics. They do not understand the effect the abuse has on a victim. They are of the view that their activities do not do any harm to the child and they will play down the harm they have caused. They often blame the child, saying that the child was too friendly or too dependent. They do not accept any blame for the abuse. If they admit blame, they usually point to an external reason such as drunkenness to excuse their actions. Such offenders are usually socially isolated. The main difference between physical and sexual abuse is that the latter can never be accidental. Sexual abuse is planned and if it takes place in the home, the planning is over a long period, whereas physical abuse can occur on the spur of the moment. I am convinced that rehabilitative programmes have an important role to play and I fully support the amendment to ensure this House is informed over the years of the development of the programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated during the Committee Stage debate, the type of information this amendment seeks is already reported regularly by the Minister to the Oireachtas, usually by way of reply to parliamentary questions. The most recent occasion I gave such information was 14 February 2001, in response to a parliamentary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the director general of the prison service to ensure the development of rehabilitative programmes for sex offenders is given priority attention. I expect that, in his annual report to the Minister, he will provide this information and I will ensure this report is made available to the Oireachtas. During Committee Stage, Deputy O'Sullivan, while arguing for the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill, made it clear that the <Col N="539" /> important point is that the information is made available. She accepted that the information is made available by the Minister and by his predecessors by way of reply to parliamentary questions. Therefore, we are not discussing a point of principle about what information should or should not be in the public arena. We are debating the most appropriate and efficient way of making the information available to the public. There is nothing secretive about it. I accept without qualification, of course, the right of the public to know the number of sex offenders in our prisons, what treatment is available to them and how many avail of that treatment. Seeing as the information is already available, acceptance of the amendment would place an additional and clearly unnecessary burden on the officials who would have to prepare an additional report suitable for laying before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment. Acceptance of the amendment would not result in even one extra sex offender being treated in prison. It would not result in any additional information about the treatment of sex offenders in prison being made public. I regard the treatment of sex offenders in prison as being of paramount importance. However, I am cautious about being over-optimistic about the results of the treatment. Expert opinion, in so far as I can gauge it, is still divided on just how useful treatment of sex offenders can be in the long-term. We would be foolish not to provide and not to encourage participation in treatment programmes for convicted sex offenders, but we would be equally foolish to drop our guard in the light of such provision. That is one of the reasons the tracking system for convicted sex offenders, which is being provided for in this Bill, will apply to all convicted sex offenders, regardless of whether they have received treatment in the past or will receive treatment in the future.</P>
    <P>The facilities to treat sex offenders in prison are continually improving. There are now two sex offenders treatment programmes available in Arbour Hill and the Curragh. I always said the Curragh Place of Detention would provide an additional sex offenders treatment programme, and this is now up and running. We still have the thinking skills course and a psychology service is currently available in institutions. I approved the establishment of an expert group in December 1998 to review and report on the future role, needs, structure and organisation of the psychological service. Everything possible is being done from that perspective and from the perspective of the psychiatric service to address this matter. That is the situation which currently obtains and I hope this information is of assistance to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I am seeking the formalisation of the reporting of this information which I believe should be provided for in the Bill. A specific <Col N="540" /> report containing all this information should be published at a specific time each year. That would be preferable to relying on intermittent and haphazard information from the Department. I accept information is provided when it is sought and that it is the job of Opposition spokespersons to table appropriate questions to elicit such information. However, it would be preferable, in the public interest, if there were a formalised system for reporting this information on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville correctly stated that this is a very complex area in that there are different types of sex offenders for whom there are different types of treatments and whose prognoses differ in terms of their likely response to treatment. This is a further reason we should have a system whereby this information would be provided regularly. There is an onus on all of us to take every possible action to prevent crimes of this nature occurring or to reduce their incidence. A person convicted of a sex offence should be encouraged and prevailed upon to take rehabilitative action while he or she is in custody and following his or her release.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this amendment as it would be much more preferable to have a formal structure in place to deal with this very serious matter. We must do and be seen to do everything possible to ensure treatment is available and availed of. This issue must be addressed in an overall context. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as it would not be a particularly onerous duty to provide an annual report.</P>

      <P>Our objective must be to ensure all of the 360 sex offenders in our prisons who are susceptible to treatment &ndash; and I believe most of them are &ndash; are encouraged to avail of that treatment. Sex offences seriously affect children's lives not only in terms of the pain and suffering children experience at the time of the abuse, but also in terms of long-term damage into adulthood. We have only recently become aware, through television documentaries on sex abuse in institutions etc., that such abuse affects people throughout their lives. No stone should be left unturned in tackling this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment seeks to ensure that sex offenders are rehabilitated and that they have an understanding of their conditions. Some paedophiles, knowing they have a problem, avail of counselling and never commit offences. However, we are speaking about people who do not realise how vile and damaging are their actions and we must do our utmost to make them aware of that.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which the parliamentary counsel considers it advisable to make. Section 7(1) states that a person is subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act if convicted of a sexual offence after its commencement. That is without prejudice to subsection (2) under which a person could also be subject to Part 2 in certain circumstances where the offence was committed before the commencement of Part 2. However, under section 15(7), a person on whom a sex offender order is made is subject to the requirements of Part 2 for as long as the order is in force. In light of this, the parliamentary counsel considers that the cross-reference proposed in this amendment is desirable and, accordingly, I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 7 to 11 and substitute &ldquo;offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks the deletion of paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection 2(<i>b</i>) which provides that a sentence imposed on a person at any time in respect of an offence covered by this Bill shall be subject to the Bill's provisions. The Minister's proposal limits the Bill's requirements and there is concern that people who come into this country from outside the State pose the danger of sexually abusing children. My amendment will cover all <Col N="542" /> circumstances. It is important that all those who have been convicted of sexual offences are known to the Garda and that the Garda Síochána is aware of their presence in an area. There is great concern since the introduction of the Sex Offenders Act in the United Kingdom that known paedophiles have entered Ireland.</P>
    <P>An eminent journalist, Phelim McAleer, said in a report that four paedophiles from Derry had moved to Cork to avoid the sex offenders register which tracks and monitors their movements within the United Kingdom. He stated that the revelation would increase concern that sex abusers are using the Republic as a safe haven to continue their activities. It is important that all paedophiles and those convicted of child sex offences are known to the Garda. Mr. McAleer also reported that, according to legal sources in Derry who deal with ex-prisoners, the four paedophiles who moved to Cork were serving sentences in Magilligan Prison outside the city. Legal sources say that, from the questions the men asked before they left, it was clear they were going to Cork to avoid the register. They asked if they could be tracked there and what their obligations would be. Cork was a logical choice for them. There was no register in the Republic and it was the furthest possible point from Derry.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that groups of paedophiles are arriving in the Republic from Britain. The situation is very dangerous. Being in each other's company provides them with self-justification, each validating the other's illegal behaviour as acceptable. In those circumstances, they pose a high risk to children. Ms Breidge Gadd, head of the Northern Ireland Probation Board, said the failure to set up a register in the Republic means paedophiles will be attracted here, especially persistent offenders who intend to continue to abuse children. Since the introduction of the register in the United Kingdom, there has been a movement of these people to the Republic. They should all be on a register here as well as those convicted in the Republic for child sex abuse.</P>
    <P>My amendment will ensure all convicted paedophiles and child sex offenders are covered by the Bill. Some saw it as an inevitability that people involved in paedophile rings would view the South as a safe haven. It is clear that abusers have taken advantage of this loophole. The head of the Northern Ireland Probation Board said a paedophile with evil intent will naturally go to one or other parts of these islands which does not have a register and where their movements are not monitored as closely. She also stated the statutory agencies which work with sex offenders found increasingly that their clients had moved to the Republic. She said that she had heard from other professions that their people had gone to the South and that the word in Northern Ireland was that it was happening. My amendment will ensure that all such convicted sex offenders will be on the register here to ensure full protection for children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I understand there is not a legal impediment to full retrospection as opposed to partial retrospection as provided for in the Bill. While I appreciate the difficulties this may cause for the authorities, they should endeavour to overcome those difficulties for the sake of protecting children. There must be a mechanism in the Bill to ensure those people released from prison in Britain since the introduction of Sex Offenders Act are obliged to register in Ireland once the Bill is enacted. I do not accept that convicted people on the sex offenders register in the UK who enter this jurisdiction should not be obliged to register just because they were convicted prior to the passing of the legislation. That they are on a foreign register and travel to Ireland poses a threat to children. We must ensure they do not do so. The amendment covers this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised on Committee Stage to examine the situation where they have been included on the register. The Minister accepted it as a fair point that there is a degree of certainty about a person being already registered as a sex offender in a foreign jurisdiction. The Minister agreed to examine that and I urge him to take this serious issue on board to ensure children are protected, regardless of when the offences were committed. The Minister was concerned that people who had been convicted years ago would be obliged to register. While they should present themselves for registration, there is a mechanism in the Bill for a person convicted ten, 20 or 30 years ago to go to court to request that they not be obliged to adhere to the conditions of the Bill. It means a person who served a sentence for child sex offences 15, 20 or 30 years ago will not necessarily have to comply with registration requirements. While all such cases should be examined and the Garda and the State should make a value judgment and present a case to court on whether child sex offenders who offended at any time should be required to comply with the legislation, the Bill should ensure they automatically comply with its requirements.</P>

      <P>I support the intent of Deputy Neville's amendment. There is concern that people who have offended outside our jurisdiction will use Ireland as a safe haven. We want to ensure that does not happen and I commend Deputy Neville on his amendment in that regard. The Minister in his amendments, which are being discussed with amendment No. 6, appears to address the problem identified by Deputy Neville regarding other jurisdictions. Will the Minister, when replying, clarify whether that refers to people included on a register in another country as and from the date the legislation is passed or if it will include people already on registers in their own jurisdictions? If that can be clarified, it will make a difference to my opinion on whether the Minister has met the concerns expressed by Deputy Neville on Committee Stage, concerns which I support. I welcome that the Minister has <Col N="544" /> responded to the issue identified on Committee Stage. Perhaps he will clarify what will be achieved by the amendment he has tabled on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The effect of Deputy Neville's amendment would be to introduce full retrospection into the notification system. In other words, any person ever convicted of a sexual offence in Ireland would be obliged to notify the Garda of his or her name and address no matter what his or her age or circumstances. It became clear on Committee Stage that this is not what the Deputy intended. My amendments give effect to the substance of what his amendment sought to do. There may not be a legal impediment to full retrospection as opposed to partial retrospection as provided for in the Bill, but the practical difficulties are such as to make it unworkable and unfair. I was aware when preparing the Bill that full retrospection would be desirable but would also be impractical. The main argument in favour of it was that it would offer greater protection to vulnerable persons. However, the civil sex offender order does just that, but I will explain why it was decided to favour partial retrospection.</P>
      <P>When a convicted person serves his or her sentence or otherwise pays the penalty for his or her offence, he or she is then set free. All contact with the criminal justice system is ended. As the years go by and no further offending takes place, the offenders are increasingly assimilated into society by working and raising families, or they may leave the country. Under the provisions of the Bill, it is up to the offender to notify the Garda of his or her name and address. The Garda will not pursue offenders telling them to register. In the case of persons still in contact with the criminal justice system, the Garda will know immediately whether an offender has notified them.</P>
      <P>In the case of old offences the Garda would have little knowledge of who should register and offenders may not be aware of this new obligation. Therefore, the register would be incomplete or even incorrect if wrong information was given. The accuracy of the register would be compromised, resulting in a loss of confidence in it. It is much better to have a register with a starting point we can stand over and which, in coming years, will provide a full picture of all released sex offenders from that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville expressed concern on Committee Stage that the provisions in the Bill would not catch sex offenders already in the country. I undertook to examine his proposals to see if anything could be done to meet the point he raised while, at the same time, staying within the retrospection parameters I have outlined. I am happy to propose these amendments which do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my first amendment is to place a notification obligation on sex offenders convicted abroad who might already be in the country or who might come here in the future to escape a notification obligation in their own <Col N="545" /> country originating before this Bill is enacted. The amendment brings within the scope of Part 2 convicted sex offenders who are required to notify certain information to police in another jurisdiction as a result of their conviction for a sexual offence in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, this means that, at the commencement of the Bill and thereafter, any sex offender in this country with a notification or similar requirement in another jurisdiction will have to notify their names and addresses here to the Garda. This applies regardless of whether they complied with the requirements in their own country. It will also apply to sex offenders with a prior notification obligation in another country who may come here after the commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>My second amendment is a standard provision defining the term &ldquo;police&rdquo;. It is an advisable provision as other countries have regional and local police. We want to ensure that registration with all police forces is covered, even where there is no comparable force in this country. My third amendment is a necessary consequence of the policy provided in the first amendment. The existing wording in section 24 concerning proof of conviction in another country is not adequate to prove that a person has a notification requirement in that country. This amendment will ensure that no loophole will exist where such proof is sought.</P>
    <P>I am happy to propose these amendments which extend the scope of the notification obligation without breaching the retrospectivity considerations to which I referred earlier. This is because the new category of persons subject to that obligation is still, through their obligations elsewhere, in contact with the criminal justice system. My amendments also add even more weight to the Government's often stated determination that Ireland will not be used as a sanctuary by foreign sex offenders. I commend my three amendments to the House and I thank Deputy Neville for raising the issue and for being so constructive about it and also Deputy O'Sullivan for her support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his consideration and for introducing amendments which strengthen the Bill. They will ensure that people from Britain who have taken advantage of the situation in Ireland since the introduction of the British register will be subject to the Irish register. Britain is particularly important in this regard because of the common language in both countries. There could be language barriers with regard to children in other parts of the continent, but communication with children in Britain is much easier because of the common language. It is important to take account of the register in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister's point with regard to retrospection. The Bill will go to the Seanad <Col N="546" /> after it has been passed by this House and perhaps some element of retrospection could be included there. The case of a person who was convicted of a sexual offence 30 years ago is totally different from the case of a person who was released from prison in the past five or ten years. There should be some element of retrospection in that regard. It is a severe step for the State to place on a register people who completed their sentences and satisfied their debt to society. However, it involves the protection of children and we must ensure that every possible means is used in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said my amendment would create an impossible situation because it refers to cases since the foundation of the State. I must be reasonable and accept that the Minister has a point, but perhaps there is a case for some retrospection. People who recently committed offences are more dangerous and more likely to reoffend than people who were convicted up to 30 years ago and have not come to the notice of the police in the past 15 years. We should bear in mind the area with which the Bill deals. I accept my proposal is draconian and I make no excuses in that regard.</P>

      <P>I thought my amendments addressed the concerns expressed. I indicated that it would not be practicable and it would probably be unfair to have a full degree of retrospectivity. I outlined the reasons for this and I am convinced my amendments will ensure that Ireland will not ever become a sanctuary for sex offenders from other jurisdictions. This was the objective of the exercise in producing the amendments. There is no point establishing an uncertain and incomplete register. That would be a mistake and the wrong starting point. I want to ensure that Ireland does not become a sanctuary for foreign sex offenders &ndash; the Bill achieves this &ndash; and that the register in Ireland is complete and accurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's view, but there should be some element of protective retrospection. The effect of sexual abuse on children is profound. They suffer long-term traumatic stress disorders and usually have a range of mental health problems. They often inflict harm on themselves either directly through deliberate self injury and self mutilation or indirectly through eating disorders and drug abuse. Once children have become victims of abuse, they tend to suffer further abuse in their later lives at the hands of the same person or another perpetrator. Children who are abused in a family are often more vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles when they reach school age and adolescence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special measures must be taken to protect such children who have low self-esteem and low self-confidence as a result of the abuse. Paedophiles identify such children and target them by offering them some form of comfort or attention. One cannot argue about controlling the movement of <Col N="547" /> paedophiles when one examines the effect of their vile activities. Paedophiles who have been convicted and completed their sentences prior to the enactment of the Bill should be included on the register because their victims who suffer sexual abuse are likely to suffer deep and extremely traumatic effects as teenagers and adults. They can suffer from multiple personalities, bouts of alcohol consumption to the point of feeling suicidal, depression and elation and nervous breakdowns. They may be unable to understand the difference between reality and fantasy and they may spend long periods alone in self-imposed isolation from others due to their mistrust and disbelief in humanity. For this reason, among others, some retrospection should be applied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 22, to delete &ldquo;2 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments provide for an indefinite duration if the sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence concerned is one of imprisonment for life or for a term of more than six months and for ten years if the sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence concerned is six months or less. We cannot highlight adequately the gravity of the extent of the damage done to children who have been sexually abused. In my earlier contribution, I outlined the effects on the child. Many crimes are vicious and unpleasant but the crime of sexual abuse of a young child robbing it of its innocence is so repugnant that we are entitled to consider special ways of dealing with the issue and making it clear society abhors such activities. It is in this context that I table the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children's safety should be of paramount priority. We must ensure that we take important steps to rigorously address child abuse and other serious sexual offences against adults. Society must give the rights of children priority over those of their abusers. These amendments are not a panacea for all serious sex offences, whether against children or adults &ndash; no amendment can control all paedophiles. However, we must ensure that every step is taken to help the Garda trace those who might offend. The Garda must be in a position to identify suspects following commission of a crime and this would act as a deterrent to some would-be offenders. The amendments proposed would increase the severity of the registration and thereby be a more stringent deterrent than the Bill as presented. Most sex<Col N="548" /> ually abused children suffer long-term traumatic stress disorders and a range of mental health problems.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendments as one cannot argue about controlling the movement of paedophiles when one measures the extreme effects of their vile activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments propose to reduce the severity of sentence required before a person becomes liable to the relevant period for notification. For example, under the first amendment, a life time notification requirement would apply following a six month prison sentence, instead of a two year sentence as proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>These amendments were debated on Committee Stage and Deputy Neville said he would raise them again on Report Stage. Despite speaking strongly against the amendments on Committee Stage, I re-examined them and the issues they raised in anticipation of their being put down again for Report Stage and I have reached the same conclusions, therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>While the provisions in the Bill in this respect are to some extent arbitrary in that deciding on the duration of sentences is not an exact science, two major concerns have directly influenced the proposals in the Bill. First, we looked at the English duration of sentences, took them as a baseline and examined them to see if they were appropriate for Ireland. In other words, could we justify proposing different durations. The only change that could be justified, using that yardstick, was to reduce the two and a half year prison sentence for a life time notification requirement to two years. This was done to bring cases within the jurisdiction of the District Court in certain circumstances. Second, and more importantly, we had to have regard to proportionality, a concept developed in recent years by our courts. The balance between sentence and the notification obligation is about right and to extend that obligation, as proposed in the amendments, would stretch that balance, possibly to breaking point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville was of the view that we as legislators should decide what the courts should do. He also accepts the principle of proportionality and says that it is inherent in his amendments. It is in one sense in that, for example, the notification requirement where a six months sentence is handed down is greater than where the sentence is for less than six months. However, that is not necessarily what the courts had in mind when they introduced into Irish constitutional law in the case of Cox <i>v.</i>Ireland in 1992 the notion of proportionality between offence and penal consequence. That was extended in the case of Lovett <i>v. </i>the Minister for Education in 1997 which applied the notion of proportionality, by particular relevance to the statutory objectives sought to be achieved, to consequences which would limit an individual's constitutional rights, and were <Col N="549" /> sought to be applied as a secondary consequence of criminal conviction.</P>
    <P>What all that means, by reference to the amendments, is that a constitutional issue is involved and I am satisfied that acceptance of the amendments could upset the balance so carefully achieved in the Bill. The Bill already provides a mechanism whereby persons with a lifetime notification requirement, ten years after release from prison, can apply to the court to have the requirement lifted. That indicates how seriously the notion of proportionality must be taken.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Neville's reasons for retabling the amendments but, for the reasons I have explained, I regret that I cannot accept them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&ndash;The person for the time being in charge of the place where a person subject to the requirements of this Part is ordered to be imprisoned in respect of an offence (whether or not the offence that gave rise to the person's being subject to those requirements) shall notify in writing&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)before the date on which the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the person in respect of the first-mentioned offence expires or, as the case may be, the person's remission from the sentence begins (&lsquo;the date of release'), the person that he or she is subject to the requirements of this Part, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)at least 10 days before the date of release, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána of the fact that that expiry or remission will occur in relation to the person.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the prison authorities contact the Garda prior to the release of any individual serving a sentence for a sex offence. I, therefore, accept the principle underlying Deputy Neville's amendment, the result of which would be to place <Col N="550" /> this informal arrangement on a statutory basis. Having consulted about a final wording, the parliamentary counsel and the Department of Health and Children, which has responsibility for the Central Mental Hospital from where persons found guilty but insane are released, it is proposed to accept the point made in Deputy Neville's amendment, with some modifications, as indicated in the amendment. It is also proposed to extend the scope of the Deputy's amendment to ensure that not only is the Garda Commissioner informed, but the offender is also reminded before release from custody of his or her notification obligations.</P>
    <P>My amendment places a statutory obligation on the person in charge of a prison or place of detention, who would normally be the governor, or the person in charge of the Central Mental Hospital, who would normally be the director, in which a person subject to the requirements of this Part is being held, to notify the Garda Commissioner, in writing, at least ten days in advance of the release date of a person subject to the requirements of this Part. It is not necessary to refer to other hospitals as prisoners receiving treatment in hospital remain the responsibility of the prison authorities.</P>
    <P>In examining Deputy Neville's amendment, it seemed to me that not only should the Garda Commissioner be formally informed about the imminent release from custody of a convicted sex offender, but the sex offender should also be formally reminded of his or her notification obligations following release. The Bill firmly and clearly places on the offender the obligation to notify the gardaí of his or her current name and address. Those convicted of a qualifying offence after the enactment of the Bill will be notified on conviction by the court that they are subject to the notification requirements. However, the offender may have received a long custodial sentence and, in the struggle to come to terms with freedom in the early days following release, could overlook the notification obligation. To ensure this will not happen, the second part of my amendment places an onus on the person in charge to notify the offender, in writing, of his or her notification obligations following release.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment in my name and I thank Deputy Neville for bringing this issue to our attention in his amendment which I cannot accept, mainly for technical reasons.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his amendment which fully satisfies my concerns. It will ensure that the most vicious sexual offenders who have no intention of complying with any regulation on release from prison will not be able to go underground, change their names and identities and continue to offend. The tracking system between the prison service, other places of detention and the Garda strengthens the Bill and I sincerely thank the Minister for tabling the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neville wishes to reduce the ten day period allowed for compliance with the notification requirements to five days. At the select committee I conceded that the number of days allowable to a sex offender to notify the Garda of his or her current name and address is, to some extent, arbitrary. Any alternative figure would also be arbitrary. Within reason, any number of days proposed may fall within an acceptable limit.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom the figure chosen was 14 days, although I understand this is under review. In the Irish context, and bearing in mind our additional provisions relating to travel abroad and offences committed while abroad, I considered ten days the optimum figure. It could have been a few days more or a few days less. The important point is that it is within certain acceptable limits which are fair to the offender and do not jeopardise the operation of the new notification system.</P>
      <P>My main concern is to provide the optimum notification period having regard to the issues involved. Clearly, the protection of children is the most important consideration and this will be mainly enhanced through a high compliance rate. It seems that the compliance rate would not be affected by changing ten days one way or the other by a few days, but if a substantial reduction was introduced I would not be so sure. I am convinced that such a reduction would introduce difficulties affecting the ability to comply with the obligation to notify of an offender who may require time to find his or her feet following release from what may have been a long prison sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultations with experts, I propose to reduce the compliance period to seven days. Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments propose to raise the number of days for compliance with the notification system to 21 in the case of convicted sex offenders who travel abroad. In examining <Col N="552" /> these amendments we have had regard to the following important considerations. First, some people contend there are objective criteria under which we can defend treating one category of sex offender, that is, those travelling abroad, differently from other sex offenders. Others contend there are not such objective criteria. My advice is that there are not and that acceptance of these amendments would run the risk of being found in breach of European equality laws. The second consideration &ndash; these are no in particular order of importance &ndash; is whether children would be more or less safe in the context of a significantly longer notification period. Again, it would be easy to exaggerate the possible consequences for children in the absence of hard evidence, but common sense would suggest that 21 days would, if anything, provide a less safe environment for children. Third, is the seven days proposed too short in the context of fair procedures, in particular in the context of a non-punitive scheme? I think not. In coming down in favour of seven days we were conscious of the need to be fair, not only because of the inherent correctness in being fair, but because of the possible effects on the compliance rates if the procedures were interpreted as being unfair or too onerous.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have to bear in mind why I have included in the Bill a provision under which convicted sex offenders travelling abroad will be required to notify the Garda. It is not so far a feature of sex offender registers elsewhere, although that may change. When a sex offender disappears from view it is important that the Garda knows whether he or she has gone abroad or whether the offender has gone underground in this country, thus becoming potentially an extremely dangerous person. Three weeks may be too long for the Garda to be unaware of such a person's whereabouts in some cases. In an era of open borders and ease of travel this provision will be of great assistance in enhancing international police co-operation in tracking the movements of paedophiles The legislation will not only ensure that we do not become a sanctuary for other countries' paedophiles but that our legislation, which is more advanced than analogous legislation elsewhere, does not cause a problem for our neighbours.</P>
    <P>To sum up on Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments, 21 days is too long. The obligation to notify the Garda only arises where a person is abroad for a continuous period of seven days or more. Unlike persons changing address in the State or coming here from abroad, the seven days is not subject to aggregation. This means a person can go abroad for up to seven days at a time any number of times in a 12 month period. I considered it important in the context of the protection of children in particular and international police co-operation on serious crime that Garda be aware of the movements abroad of convicted sex offenders and, in that spirit, that their police colleagues abroad can be made aware of paedophiles entering their territories. Accordingly, I am <Col N="553" /> happy to recommend my amendments Nos. 14, 18, 20, 23, 26, 29, 31, 34, 41, 44 and 51.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has moved on the position in the Bill as initiated. While I welcome his response, I am convinced that the reporting time should be as tight as possible and that a person should make himself known to the Garda within five days of entering a community or coming into the State. There is no reason the mandatory reporting period under the notification requirement should not be five days. I accept the Minister's point that it is an arbitrary figure and a judgment must be made on it.</P>
      <P>Paedophiles should be frustrated in every way possible to protect children from the terrible experience of sex abuse. The time within which the Garda Síochána should be contacted by a person obliged to register should be reduced from ten days to five days after release from custody or on entering the country when registered outside. One can visualise a person entering the country from the UK and spending seven days without registering. While I accept that the figure is arbitrary, as much pressure as possible should be put on offenders to ensure early registration. Many crimes are vicious and unpleasant and we have to adopt a special approach to this serious crime. In Britain the period within which offenders must register is 14 days. I did not realise the British authorities were examining this issue. It will be interesting to read the outcome of their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I believe that we must have 100% compliance and we must insist on that. Nothing else is acceptable. I cannot accept that the compliance rate would be affected by reducing it to a five day notification period. I do not see that a reduction to five days would introduce difficulties affecting the ability to comply with the obligations to notify. I want to be fair to the child as well as to the sex offender. One cannot repair the damage done by the abuser. The Minister is concerned about the offender's release from prison and the difficulties that may apply. This may be a problem as a result of the disgraceful prison regime in this country. Surely those who have served long prison sentences must be prepared by the prison service for life outside prison. Somebody on the child sex register who is being released from prison should go through a detailed programme to prepare them for the release, to inform them of their obligations to register and to ensure they are aware of the seriousness of non-compliance. They must be informed of the procedure and how to comply with it. If there is proper preparation there is no reason they would not be in a position to comply with the requirements of the Bill in registering within five days.</P>

      <P>There are two separate issues being dealt with in these amendments and I support the proposals in the early ones to reduce the length of time that a person has before they are required to register. I have no argument with the <Col N="554" /> Minister or Deputy Neville on that. I welcome the fact that the Minister has come some distance in meeting the Deputy Neville's proposals. The matters on which I have proposed amendments relate to when a person, who has already been on the register and has been compliant, goes on holiday. I suggest that there should be leeway on that. We want people to be compliant and it is an arbitrary decision as to what figure we settle on. We need to make sure that people get on the register as quickly as possible and they must be given a few days to do that. It is a different matter when we talk about someone who has been compliant and is already on the register. If they have served their sentence, are compliant and on the register and wish to go on holiday, perhaps to a family member, there should be some leniency. They are individuals with rights despite what we are trying to do to protect society. There are balances to be maintained and that is the purpose of my amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments. This is not an exact science. We have come down in favour of seven days on the basis that it gives the individual the opportunity of being able to go abroad for a short period of time without having to notify. After a period of seven days the individual would be obliged to notify for all the reasons I have outlined. A person who is on the register and going abroad for a period less than seven days can go abroad any number of times during the same year without having to notify provided that he or she does not exceed the seven day term on any one journey. On the other hand, people coming into this jurisdiction will be subject to aggregation. For example, a paedophile registered in the North who comes to the South for four days one week and three days the following week would be obliged to register on any subsequent visit during that same year. Deputies might wonder why an individual leaving this jurisdiction is not subject to aggregation but I have received advice from the Attorney General to the effect that I could not do that. However, I have ensured that any person coming into this jurisdiction from abroad is subject to aggregation. It is open to other jurisdictions to bring in aggregation in respect of people travelling from this jurisdiction to theirs. That is a matter for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the situation is arbitrary as to whether it should be five or seven days. I feel it should be as tight as possible and it is not unreasonable to expect someone who has been released from prison or transferred from another area to register within five days. We know of situations where paedophiles have moved in from abroad for two or three days and committed offences. While I accept there must be some leeway, the more restriction we have in ensuring that the Garda are aware that the offender is in the jurisdiction, the more protection we have for the children in the area. The Minister did accept the <Col N="555" /> proposal to reduce it from ten to seven days but I feel five days would offer more protection. Two days might be very significant in the committing of a crime so I believe that my amendment reducing it to five days should be accepted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;b)his or her fingerprints,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I proposed on Committee Stage that the more identification we have of the person on the register, the more chance we have of ensuring that that person is followed up in the event of their absconding or changing identity. In particular a person's fingerprints should be available as part of the registration process. As a result of the Committee Stage debate I would be less worried about the photograph because of other difficulties. It would enhance the register if both a photograph and the fingerprints of the person were part of it. It is known in the UK, and we had an experience here, that some paedophiles have changed addresses, gone underground, changed identity, appearances and so have become a danger to children. Having fingerprints available would enhance the Garda's investigative approach to tracing paedophiles who have left the jurisdiction and have not registered elsewhere in the country. It is for the purpose of protecting children in these situations that I propose the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to place two additional requirements on convicted sex offenders when they are fulfilling their notification obligation, that is, that they provide photographs and have their fingerprints taken. I am not aware of these being obligations in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the provision relating to the information that a convicted sex offender will have to supply when registering, we were very conscious of the British and Northern Irish requirements in that respect and the high compliance rates of up to 97% in those jurisdictions. There is a direct link between the two. Whatever our own feelings about sex offenders, their devious nature and their heinous crimes, it would be counter productive to persecute or demonise them at a time when they may be making an effort to avoid <Col N="556" /> further offending and the temptations to re-offend.</P>
    <P>There is a direct and verifiable link between the amount of information required to be notified and the compliance rate, and, in the final analysis, it is the compliance rate that is important. In the non-punitive context of this provision, it is important to ensure that the notification system is easy to comply with and is one that will not frighten off sex offenders from notifying the Garda. Any fear, however unfounded or irrational, of, say, photographs given at the time of notification being made public would lessen the compliance rate and, therefore, the benefits of the notification system.</P>
    <P>With regard to photographs in particular, I am at present preparing legislation under which the Garda will have power to photograph any person who has been arrested. In addition, almost every person on whom a prison sentence is imposed has his or her photograph taken and, in the case of those who serve long sentences, photographs can be retaken close to the release date. These can be made available to the Garda. This is a better way of dealing with the question of photographs than picking out one group of offenders in the way proposed. With regard to offenders from abroad, photographs can be made available through normal police channels.</P>
    <P>The argument can be made that persons can change their appearances and that old photographs might bear little resemblance to current appearance. That is true, but as I have outlined, the photographs available to the Garda will be recent photographs. It is also the case that even after registering, persons could significantly change their appearance, whether or not a photograph was supplied.</P>
    <P>The amendment also refers to fingerprints. Apart from other considerations, I see no particular benefit in persons being required to give fingerprints when registering.</P>
    <P>Whether or not intended, the amendments would require an offender to provide a photograph and have his or her fingerprints taken every time he or she notified the Garda in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <P>My reservations on these amendments are based on the firm belief, supported by evidence from other countries, that the less information that has to be notified the more likely will be a person to comply with the notification requirements. It would be far better to have a compliance rate of, say, 95% based on the provisions in the Bill than a significantly lower percentage where photographs were supplied and fingerprints taken. I remind Deputies that as soon as this Bill is enacted the analysis of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences will gather pace and, if the need for changes to the law are identified, I will seek Government approval to prepare the necessary legislation. By then this <Col N="557" /> Act will have been in operation long enough for any weaknesses that could only be identified from experience gained from its operation to be rectified. For example, if experience showed that the need for photographs to be produced at the time of registration outweighed the desirability for a very high compliance rate, that could be looked at as part of the review.</P>
    <P>For the reasons stated, I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>While I see some validity in the Minister's argument with regard to the photograph being supplied at the time of registration I am still convinced there must be some mechanism for tracing a child sex offender on the register who has gone underground and left the area without notifying the Garda as to his whereabouts. These people are very dangerous at this point. Obviously they have reasons for leaving the area and for not registering in the area to which they transferred. These reasons can only be on the basis of opportunity for abusing children. They obviously know the Bill's requirements. Should they move to another Garda area, they know they are required to register. They do not register because they do not want the Garda to know they are present and they do not want Garda surveillance of their activities. One of the strengths of the Bill is the deterrent for sex offenders who are known to the Garda to re-offend.</P>
      <P>Obviously a sex offender in an area knows the Garda is aware of his presence, that there is a certain amount of surveillance, that gardaí are watching his movements and if there is anything suspicious the Garda can either advise the person or reveal the person's name, where necessary. Therefore, there is a deterrent. If a paedophile moves elsewhere and does not register it is obvious he is intent on abusing children. There should be some mechanism whereby the Garda has an identity it can follow up. I see some of the reasons in regard to photographs because they are emotive. While I do not agree there should be any acceptance of non-compliance with the Bill at any level, whether 5% or 10%, I would moderate my view with regard to the photograph. However, I am convinced there should be some follow-up where a sex offender leaves the jurisdiction and does not register elsewhere that would enable the Garda to chase that person and ensure children are protected.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty with fingerprints. Deputy Neville is of the view that fingerprints should be taken and agrees that the photograph proposal is in a different category. For the life of me I cannot see how fingerprints could assist. A person who is a sex offender goes to the Garda station and gives his or her name and address and if he or she changes that name and address notifies the Garda also. By leaving it <Col N="558" /> at that, we should have a high compliance rate. We are seeking a compliance rate of 100%. In Britain the compliance rate has been in the region of 97%. Britain did not have any requirement for fingerprints or for photographs. It would be difficult from a legal perspective to look for fingerprints from an individual going into the Garda station to give his name and address.</P>

      <P>These amendments concern the requirement to give notification when a person is on the register. I am seeking to reduce the bureaucracy. Amendment No. 36 seeks to ensure that the notification process should not be considered invalid because certain aspects of it are invalid. Amendment No. 37 seeks that the requirement for a person to register his or her date of birth each time should only exist if required by a garda.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, a person who moves in and out of the jurisdiction may have to come back to the register on a number of occasions. I do not see why such people should have to state their date of birth each time.</P>
      <P>Section 9(6) states that a person shall give his or her date of birth, name on the relevant date and, where he or she used one or more other names on that date, each of those names, and the home address on the relevant date. This highlights that a number of different details are required. I am proposing that a notification should not automatically be considered invalid if the individual inadvertently omits a small piece of information. The Garda can make judgments in these matters.</P>
      <P>In reply to the previous group of amendments, and speaking on the issue of fingerprints and photographs, the Minister stated that the less that has to be notified, the more likely the person is to comply. We wish people to comply with the register. We should not come down too heavily on a person who is known to the Garda and who inadvertently fails to give his or her date of birth, which the Garda may already know. Such people are being compliant with the register and perhaps there is no intention to behave otherwise. These amendments seek to encourage compliance.</P>

      <P>A person notifying the Garda under Part 2 of the Bill has to state his or her name and address and date of birth. This is the minimum and maximum amount of information which should be required. I have explained my general position on this point on an earlier amendment and there is no need to repeat that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy wishes to make information <Col N="560" /> regarding age mandatory only if required by the Garda. However, the Garda will always want that information which will be important for many reasons. Such information would be crucial from the point of view of risk assessment and identification.</P>
    <P>The information might also be used for cross-referencing and statistical collation. However, it is important that the offender be in no doubt when registering about exactly what information to give the Garda. If the notification is made in person there would be little practical difficulty with the amendment as the Garda would ask for the date of birth each time.</P>
    <P>However, because of the provisions for postal notifications, the offender would not know the requirement of the Garda as to his or her date of birth when notifying by this method. Other means of fulfilling the notification obligation may be prescribed in future regulations as advances in technology make them feasible.

      <P>I proposed this amendment on Committee Stage. The amendment concerns a person who may be detained in hospital and is medically certified as being incapable of complying with the notification requirements of the Bill. Such situations will arise.</P>
      <P>Section 9(7) deals with determining a period for registration and disregarding any time during which a person is remanded in custody, serving a sentence or on temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. The amendment would also include people who are ill in hospital and who are medically certified as being incapable of complying with the notification requirements.</P>
      <P>The amendment would deal with a situation where, for example, someone is recuperating from a serious stroke or an accident and is medically certified as being incapable of complying with the Bill. Such a person could be unconscious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister stated that this was a sensible amendment and undertook to discuss with the parliamentary counsel how best to resolve the concerns it addressed. How can someone who is in hospital or who is unconscious <Col N="561" /> register? Will someone in such circumstances be charged if he or she does not register?</P>
    <P>What of someone on the register who is unconscious in hospital in Limerick and is moved to Dublin for special treatment? Many people from my area come to the national rehabilitation hospital in Dún Laoghaire. If such a person is on the register and is moved to Dún Laoghaire, as I understand it, he or she is obliged to register in the Garda region in which they reside. This amendment would ensure that such people would not be charged with an offence. It would also require such people to register if they are remaining in the area once the medical certification has expired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasonable amendment. From his comments on Committee Stage, we understood the Minister would consider the points made by Deputy Neville. The register does not intend that people would have to get out of their hospital beds and go back to where they come from to register. Deputy Neville's proposal is reasonable and I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 9(2) provides that certain periods can be disregarded when determining the time that a notification requirement starts, namely, the time a person is remanded in custody, the time spent in prison or the time spent on temporary release. In other words, if, for example, a person serves five years in prison the life time notification requirement will commence seven days after his or her release. If a person is sentenced to nine months in prison, the ten year notification requirement commences seven days following his or her release.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks also to stop the clock during the time an offender might be in hospital and is incapable of complying with the notification requirement due to illness, etc. On Committee Stage I offered the opinion that this looked like a sensible amendment and undertook to consult the parliamentary counsel regarding the matter. Following those consultations and further consideration of the amendment, we are of the opinion the amendment is neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to the amendment. First, the periods which can be disregarded as set out in section 9(2) are related to the offender's relationship at a given time to aspects of the criminal justice system such as being remanded in custody or serving a prison sentence. These are easily definable and understood as periods during which the clock stands still as far as the notification requirement is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being in hospital is less definite and adds a level of subjectivity to the process. In addition, the offender may not wish the doctor to know that he or she has a notification obligation as a <Col N="562" /> sex offender or, because of a severe medical condition, may be incapable of informing the doctor of the obligation.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, was on an official visit to Japan. One of her speeches, which was widely reported in the media, carried a very significant comment coming <Col N="563" /> as it did from a Minister, particularly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. She stated that Ireland has a first world economy but a Third World infrastructure. How right she is. The country has a ramshackle rail system, an inadequate public transport system and a road system that is becoming even more strangled day by day through gridlock. The Tánaiste as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for the industrial jobs sector must also have been very mindful of our current perilously critical electricity power situation.</P>
    <P>Last January, California suffered a major power collapse. The State of California has the most advanced industrial park in the world, the very heart of America's technology boom, yet, because of lack of planning and the failure to manage privatisation and de-regulation properly, the lights went out in Silicon Valley. Right across San Francisco Bay, because of the electricity blackout, traffic lights failed to function, petrol stations closed, bank-telling machines were paralysed, lifts stalled and television and PC screens went blank. The hub of the American technology miracle had to resort to generators, flashlights and candles.</P>
    <P>Last week, California experienced an even worse power collapse. The message from the power hungry companies based in Silicon Valley was blunt and forthright: &ldquo;If we cannot anticipate a reliable supply of power to run our computers, then we will move elsewhere.&rdquo; If they decide to move, they certainly will think twice about moving to Ireland because of the very real prospect that a California type power collapse could well be on the cards here. All one has to do is look at the growing number of amber and red alerts to see that we are in an extremely fragile situation as regards electrical power supply.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago, RTE's 6.01 and 9 o'clock news bulletins on TV ran a sobering series on the critical state of electricity supply. On three successive nights the RTE news team visited Dublin, Ballina and Cork. In all three locations the story was the same &ndash; power supply problems were causing major headaches for existing companies. In the case of Dublin, data hosting companies complained they were being contacted by the ESB at peak demand times and asked to switch off their plant. In Ballina, the manager of Hollister, Mr. Pat O'Malley, confirmed that because of the frailty of the electrical system, the company had no option but to bring in its own one megawatt generator. The whole industrial and commercial fabric of Cork city is under threat because of threatened power shortages.</P>
    <P>The IDA was interviewed on the same programme and had no hesitation in confirming that because it could not guarantee power supply to prospective industries, foreign investment prospects will be badly affected. The ESB was asked <Col N="564" /> on the same programme for its observations on the situation. The reply was extremely significant on two fronts: first, as the monopoly power supplier who knows exactly what the situation is and, second, because time and time again when Opposition Members raised concerns about the electricity supply, the Minister has repeatedly told the House that she has been assured that there would be &ldquo;adequate electricity supplies provided by the ESB up to and including winter 2000&rdquo;. Yet, on the same RTE programme, the ESB said the network is &ndash; in the company's own words &ndash;&ldquo;creaking&rdquo; and that the problem is getting worse. According to the ESB, it has problems both with transmission and generation. Mr. Seán Dorgan was quoted as confirming that from the point of view of generation, in order to keep pace with demand, the system would need 480 megawatts additional generation every two years.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that we have a critical power position when political and departmental management is so lacking? Today we had oral questions to the Minister for Public Enterprise. One of the questions I had tabled was to ask the Minister if a report had been presented to the Government warning of an imminent electricity and gas crisis. On Thursday last I received a telephone call from the Minister's Department asking me to what report I was referring. The Department of Public Enterprise seems to be totally oblivious to the existence of any such report being presented to the Government. I had to refer the Department to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 February 2001, Business and Finance section, page 19, which contained an article entitled &ldquo;Energy Crisis in the Republic could mean capital funds loss&rdquo;. It is incredible that neither the Minister nor the Department would appear to have seen the report.</P>
    <P>The newspaper article confirmed that the Department had commissioned DKM Economic Consultants to carry out the study. The report is extremely ominous. It confirms that many areas of the State face high risks of unplanned electricity outages due to transmission system weaknesses. In addition, depleted gas supplies and inadequate generating capacity for electricity are increasing the risk of outages this winter and next. The report stated</P>
    <P>The risk of unplanned outage this current winter is markedly higher than it was in the peak of January 2000, and that risk will increase shortly again for the winter of 2001-2002.</P>
    <P>The report warns that a failure to invest in generation and transmission facilities over the next few years would lead to social and economic dislocation. The report also stated</P>
    <P>Clearly, a lack of action in relation to the serious energy situation in which the economy now finds itself, will result in a flight of digital capital to economies where reliable and secure <Col N="565" /> telecommunications and energy supplies are guaranteed.</P>
    <P>What is particularly significant is the time lag, lack of vision and lack of planning because EirGrid, the national electricity grid company, admits that the upgrading of the transmission system has a lead in time of seven years due to planning, legal and construction processes.</P>
    <P>Here we have a key report, commissioned by the Department of Public Enterprise, identifying a critical power supply situation which would totally undermine the well being of the Celtic tiger. It is a report one would imagine should have sent shock tremors right through economic Departments, which should have gone straight to the top of the Government agenda and should have triggered a major review of energy policy. The impression I got from the telephone call last Thursday was that the Department was blissfully unaware of its existence or, at best, might have been mildly aware that there was a report somewhere.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the various areas at risk and, like the RTE programme, there is a particular emphasis on the Cork region. The power supply requirements of the data hosting industry is a central theme of the DKM report. Data hosting has become massive business and millions of dollars of investment have been poured into Dublin in the past few months. As we speak, several warehouses full of servers are being built in Dublin to host and manage data that makes us part of the world wide web. At least 23 further centres of this kind are planned for the Republic, which will bring in more than $1 billion dollars to the State. To date, only two of these are planned for outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Here we have a huge growth area with major revenue earning potential and, without any new centres coming on stream, existing centres are being telephoned by the country's monopoly power supplier, the ESB, and asked to switch off their systems because of inadequate power in the grid. In fairness, the surge in popularity of data hosting centres was not expected by those involved in the e-business arena, not to mention those in the utility sector. However, the reality is that e-business companies depend for their survival on facilities being provided immediately and the ESB is simply unable to facilitate them. Data centres only began springing up in such huge numbers last year and each needs the same amount of power as a medium sized town. As a result of the speed of the sector's development, they need the power to be made available almost immediately.</P>
    <P>This sudden growth and surge has caught the ESB unawares and the infrastructure to deliver the power is simply not available. The ESB has grossly under estimated the requirements of the digital economy and the e-commerce sector. While it would steadfastly maintain that there is <Col N="566" /> a safe margin between supply and demand, one has to ask why it was necessary for the company to lease five massive generators from General Electric in the United States in order to sustain supply over the winter months. The ESB located three of the generators at Aghada, County Cork, and two in Killala, County Mayo. Each generator had a 22.9 megawatt capacity output.</P>
    <P>In total, it cost £10 million just to lease these generators for the six months and a further £10 million to fuel and maintain them. Each generator is now wending its way back to the United States in what must be the sweetest of sweet deals for the American leasing company. Such expensive <i>ad hoc</i> measures are the clearest possible illustration of the Government's failure to plan properly for the energy needs of the country. What is even more evident is the grossly inadequate level of infrastructure. I refer here to lines cables and the sub-stations which simply cannot carry the power from the generating facilities across the country to their destinations. That is an appalling indictment. On one hand we have the IDA and Ministers, who are absent from the country on a regular basis, aggressively marketing Ireland as the place to locate, while those who locate here are being asked to close down their operations at peak demand time. What more need I say?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement that seven international companies due to build data centres in Ireland have either deferred their plans or dropped them altogether highlights the concerns expressed in a recent Government report regarding an impending energy crisis in Ireland. Data hosting centres are crucial to the Government's plans to make Ireland the e-hub of Europe. However, data hosting centres in Dublin are regularly asked by the ESB to suspend their operations during periods of peak demand. The ESB has acknowledged that its network is creaking under modern day power demands.</P>
      <P>On her recent visit to Japan, the Tánaiste stated that Ireland has a first rate economy but a third rate infrastructure in many areas. The report compiled for the Department of Public Enterprise by DKM predicted that delays in major electricity projects mean it would be very difficult for the ESB to accept large new loads such as data centres. EirGrid, the national grid company, has warned that the electricity network will operate without a safe margin of reserve capacity next winter. This will mean that the situation <i>vis-à-vis </i>electricity generation will be tight, with the threat of power cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Demand for power broke the 4,000 megawatt threshold for the first time in January. While the national system can produce up to 4,800 megawatts, some of the reserve capacity is available for only five or six hours. Such reserves would not be sufficient to replace the output of two major generation stations in the event of their breaking <Col N="567" /> down, particularly given that Ireland's demand for electricity is increasing by 250 megawatts annually. That is the equivalent of approximately 50% of the output of a power station.</P>
    <P>Industry analysts estimate technology companies can lose from £800,000 per hour to £800,000 a minute, due to lost sales and lost productivity, when the power goes down. For a chip manufacturer such as Intel, lost power can mean a glitch in the sensitive chip fabrication process. The technology industry is hugely dependent on a guaranteed and stable power supply. Given the major growth of that industry in Ireland, this highlights the need to make such power supplies secure.</P>
    <P>In recent months, Ireland has seen a great influx of data warehouse companies, which manage and control Internet bandwidth for other companies and look after their websites. These companies each use the power of a small town and a primary consideration for them, in terms of where to locate their operations, is access to the power grid. Does anybody in Government track the companies that are establishing operations here and what are their electricity needs? We are advertising this nation as a prime location for technology companies, e-commerce and related industries. If there is not careful planning we will be faced next winter with a situation similar to that which obtains in California. Ireland could then face a crisis in its technology industry that will eclipse any current fears of a US recession.</P>
    <P>The lack of action on this issue by the Government will result in a flight of e-commerce and technology companies to countries with reliable energy resources. The recent loss of the seven data centres is estimated to have cost the economy £120 million and may herald a number of similar announcements unless urgent action is taken to increase energy generation capacity in Ireland. The Government must speed up liberalisation of the energy sector to provide extra generating capacity. It is vitally important to the development of the economy not only that we have sufficient energy but that we have data storage facilities in the country to ensure a sufficient capacity for e-commerce activities here.</P>
    <P>Significant reinforcement of the electricity and gas networks is needed to bring any new significant generating capacity into commercial operation. Such upgrading work is required on the electricity transmission system in Dublin and in the BMW region, and to the gas transportation network outside the capital. In its absence, power stations will not be able to send electricity into the transmission network at full capacity. While we can discuss attracting additional investment in relation to generating capacity, our efforts will prove futile unless we have a transmission network capable of relaying power to various locations throughout the country. Serious questions will continue to be asked for as long as <Col N="568" /> responsibility for this remains under the ESB's control.</P>
    <P>The system must be designed to encourage new firms to enter with a reasonable chance of making a return on their investment. In this respect, the ownership of transmission and distribution assets is crucial. EirGrid will formally separate from the ESB next June, but will function as a grid operator with the ESB retaining ownership of the transmission assets and responsibility to maintain the network. The Competition Authority has stated that it is the wrong route to take and that the ESB should not be allowed to retain these assets. When a new operator desires to enter the generation market, the transmission system must be upgraded to accommodate it. If EirGrid, the national transmission system operator, owned and controlled the transmission assets, it would have an incentive to facilitate access to the grid. International experience indicates that the appropriate policy response must be rapid and meaningful deregulation, which is not happening here at present.</P>
    <P>A £500 million programme has been put in place for the next five years to upgrade the electricity transmission network, which is crucial to modernise the current system. However, the level of public opposition to this programme is growing. While everyone accepts that this must take place, the mechanisms used to upgrade the network must be flexible enough to allay public concerns. It is an outdated attitude on the part of the Government that cost must be the primary consideration. This attitude must take a back seat to the need to ensure that such work is delivered on schedule.</P>
    <P>The £500 million investment to which I refer is required to meet the standards set down by the electricity regulator. However, further work, much of it in the BMW region, is also required to allow for future development. Such investment could cost an additional £50 million to £100 million, but it is time we considered meeting this objective. The pending electricity shortage will also have fundamental implications for the Government's plan to secure half of all inward investment for the Border, midlands and western region. No industrialist will tolerate the length of time required to upgrade the network in these regions. If we wish to locate a large industry in Mayo or north Roscommon, for example, that is out of the question due to the lack of capacity. It is important for us to look again at how we can reincentivise investors to enter the market. We must also look at the development of the gas network in the region.</P>
    <P>To decide on the development of such vital infrastructure solely on economic grounds will severely hamper the development of the regions. We need such infrastructure if we are to promote the development of combined heat and power plants in the smaller towns, which are ideally <Col N="569" /> suited to such plants, thus reducing the demand for network upgrades. Such an expansion would not only facilitate the stated Government objective of bringing 50% of all new industry to the BMW region but would also help to reduce the growing demand for electricity.</P>
    <P>The IDA's anxiety about the negative impact on attracting foreign investment is backed up by the confidential report carried by DKM Consultants. The report warns that a failure to invest in generation and transmission facilities over the next few years will lead to social and economic dislocation especially in the BMW region. It is now time for the Government to take a new approach to infrastructural investment by ensuring that it is not only delivered on time but that the major gaps which remain in the regions are removed.</P>
    <P>The Government should reassess the NDP and its objectives. There is no way the current timescale and objectives will be met by the mechanism used by the Government. It is fundamentally important that those targets are met if we are to ensure the development of the regions. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. The crisis we face due to the lack of a proper electricity supply needs urgent action by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Government. The Government should undertake a programme for the immediate upgrading of the electricity transmission system within a two year period and ensure that the required additional annual 200 megawatt generation capacity is brought on stream immediately to meet increased demand. The basis of the electricity system is the reliable operation of interconnected high voltage grids which are the main arteries of the system.</P>
      <P>Growth in national electricity consumption at peak times has doubled from 200MW in 1983 to 3,500MW in 2000. There is little spare capacity for power generation in the system. Four new independent power stations have been announced by the Government but there is great difficulty in getting these much needed stations completed. Why has there been such an inordinate delay in having these power stations put in place?</P>
      <P>The transmission and distribution of the electricity system is outdated. Most of it is 30 years old. If more electricity was produced, the current transmission and distribution system would not be capable of carrying it. There is no high voltage 400-200 KV transmission line north of a line from Flagford in County Roscommon to Galway. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have stated publicly that they will be unable to attract large industries to the west and north-west if a proper power supply is not provided urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the ESBI has a planning application lodged with Sligo County Council for a 220 <Col N="570" /> KV line from Flagford to Sligo. There are approximately 4,000 objections by those living along that route against taking this supply by pylon. The ESB, which is a monopoly, states that, depending on the topography of the area, the cost of undergrounding the cable could be ten times more expensive than pylons. I call on the Minister to request another company to cost the undergrounding of the line from Flagford to Sligo. This will be fair and transparent to the large number of objectors. There is a fear of bringing this line by pylon but the cable is to carry a much needed electricity supply for the north-west.</P>
    <P>Last year the IDA report stated that there were over 150 job losses in the north-west. We need an electricity supply to bring much needed jobs to Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. If the Government is not in a position to improve that supply there is no way a large company such as Intel can locate in the north-west. Masonite Ireland Limited, which is located in my own county, Leitrim, could not locate any further north-west because of the lack of electricity supply. The problem has been ongoing for a number of years and it is essential that the supply is upgraded. The way to bring people on board, given the large number of objections, is to establish an independent body or company to cost an underground cable. This body should be separate from the ESB or the ESBI.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about outages in the electricity system in the west and north-west and this is a great concern to industry. It is happening on a regular basis and the complaints to the ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland about this from business have been growing in number. If this is allowed to continue, not alone will we not attract new industry to the area but existing industry will find it hard to sustain a proper industrial base. Rather than increasing jobs, we could see further job losses.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural development of electricity is urgently needed for the economic and social development of the west and north-west. I ask that the Government tell the House their policy to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>This week's <i>Sligo Champion</i> reports that Ireland's biggest wind farm project is planned for Sligo. The report states that a £100 million development is earmarked for 3,000 acres of commonage in Sligo. The scheme would supply up to 90,000 homes with electricity. That is welcome as wind farming is one of the ways in which we could bring about supply&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a concern. We are all aware that wind energy is one of Ireland's largest natural resources. It has security of supply. It is economically friendly and it should be encouraged as much as possible but due to the fact that there is not a proper infrastructural electrical system in the area, it is difficult to set up these wind farms. There is an urgent need to jointly plan our economic and energy development requirements. Otherwise Ireland's future as an e-commerce hub is under threat and regional development cannot be planned. That is the serious situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>The poor state of energy supply and distribution is also a deterrent to inward investment in the regions. It is difficult to plan long term for investment if faced with an uncertain and unreliable energy supply. For instance, it will be difficult to plan in the long term for database centres in the north-west or west regions.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Higgins, for bringing this serious matter before the House. I hope the Government will act in an urgent way to make sure that a proper electricity supply is brought into the west and north-west regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for bringing this important issue before the House. It is vital that we have a proper and adequate supply of electricity. Following on from what Deputy Reynolds said about wind power, it is interesting to note that Denmark produces 2,500MW of electricity using wind power. By 2010, it expects to produce half its required energy from wind power or other natural resources. Our record for the same period is a mere 55MW, so we have used very little wind power and the other energies for which we so strongly strive. The European Union wants us to use more natural resources and it made that clear again in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Stagg is in the House tonight because he was involved with me and others in trying to get a power station up and running in the north Monaghan area to cope with all the waste or biomass from mushrooms, poultry, etc. Despite the fact that we lost three competitions <Col N="572" /> at national level, the group now has a licence and some support from the fifth programme by going directly to Brussels.</P>
    <P>In its amendment the Government congratulates itself, and rightly so, on bringing in gas from Scotland through an additional pipeline and states that it will extend the gas pipeline network to the north-west. I want to advise the Minister that we still do not have gas in the north of Monaghan so I hope when she is looking after the north-west she will also look after north Monaghan as far as gas is concerned.</P>

      <P>We should try to produce as much power in areas without having to put up high powered pylons. We can work towards that in north Monaghan if we are given the support to get the power station up and running and fuelled by the natural resources in the area. I look forward to the Minister giving us all the support she can. That, in turn, could help to attract one of the database centres mentioned by previous speakers. We would certainly welcome such a database centre in north Monaghan.</P>
      <P>When one considers that the State has paid £10 million to the US to hire the means of producing electricity over a six months period, there is a strong case to be made for making grant aid available for biomass production so that these stations could be set up as quickly as possible. We are talking about tourism and waste and that is one way we can solve both problems.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I do not mean to be personal but I hope the Minister is listening to what is being said by those on this side of the House because I am alarmed by the Government amendment which notes that the amount of generating capacity continues to exceed the level of peak demand. That is simply not true. We must face reality and live in the real world. We are back to candlelight in rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may lead to romance but it is not the way forward for a modern economy. At least the Tánaiste has admitted that this is a first world economy and a Third World infrastructure. That is an alarming statement from the second most senior person in the Government to make in a country from which she is seeking investment, but at least she is speaking the truth. If the Minister for Public Enterprise, the person who is in charge of this area, is not aware of the facts we will not make progress. The ESB, a major semi-<Col N="573" /> State body, has not kept pace with the demand. It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>The country has progressed. Many of us will recall rural electrification and the advances that brought to the country in terms of agriculture and small industry. Demand has continued to grow yet the ESB has said that has taken them by surprise. The people who admit that should lose their jobs because they have not been keeping their eye on the ball. The IDA is beavering away attracting industry.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the Objective One region, rural Ireland. A recent statement that the ESB cannot guarantee power supply to another major industry in that region is not acceptable. Why should the Objective One region be denied what appears to be available to the east or the south-east? If the rest of the country, including the Minister's area, is not aware of that, obviously everything is hunky-dory in that part of the country. I want to see an even distribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>When I listened to what Deputy Reynolds said about a proposal from a private investor to set up a wind farm, I was concerned that the national grid would not be in a position to take on that project. That is not progress. This is a serious problem and it must be examined.</P>
      <P>I have had representations from constituents who have businesses which need refrigeration and it is a regular occurrence for the refrigerators to be burned out because of the surge in power. The power can diminish but then suddenly surge which causes numerous problems, including motors burning out. It is now a cost to people to have an electricity supply. Where are we going if that is the case?</P>
      <P>Prior to rural electrification, those who were mechanically minded and had the means to work with electricity developed generators but we are now told to provide our own alternative supply. That is a backward step and it is not acceptable. Generators should be located in areas as a standby. Either the ESB can do the job or it cannot and if it cannot it should let private enterprise step in and do it because this is too serious a subject.</P>
      <P>The reference in the amendment that the amount of generating capacity available continues to exceed the level of peak demand alarms me. The Minister should have the courage to say that is not true and that she will deal with it. We would like her to outline the positive steps she will take to alleviate the problems people are experiencing, as well as the IDA and other agencies which are trying to attract industry and jobs, to rural Ireland and create wealth in that region. We must have the wherewithal to do that and that lies in the Minister's hands. We are looking for a positive response and not for camouflage. We do not want to be in the dark.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(I) commends the Government for its continuing commitment to meeting the country's energy requirements through the ongoing provision of a secure and reliable electricity and gas supply at competitive prices;</P>
      <P>(II) acknowledges the continuing record growth in demand for electricity as evidence of the success of the Government's economic policies;</P>
      <P>(III) notes the opening of the power generation market to competition in 2000, and the commitment to a further opening to 40% in 2002, leading to full liberalisation in 2005;</P>
      <P>(IV) notes that the amount of generating capacity available continues to exceed the level of peak demand;</P>
      <P>(V) notes that the power supply situation has been managed very competently by the Commission for Electricity Regulation (CER), ESB and ESB national grid this winter;</P>
      <P>(VI) notes that all demands for power supply have been met and that neither the general public nor industry has suffered any interruptions or shortages, apart from normal maintenance and repair work, localised storm damage and builders digging up cables;</P>
      <P>(VII) commends the Government for the steps it has taken to ensure that all demands for power will be met during the coming winter;</P>
      <P>(VIII) notes that ESB has already taken steps for the provision of five sub-stations in the Dublin area to facilitate network strengthening and cater for data hosting sites;</P>
      <P>(IX) recognises the critical importance of energy, including infrastructure and supply, to the country's continuing economic growth and development;</P>
      <P>(X) notes that record levels of investment by ESB, including £2.1 billion in the transmission and distribution networks over the next five years will provide the country with a robust electricity infrastructure to international standard;</P>
      <P>(XI) notes the measures taken to ensure that sufficient natural gas capacity is available to meet projected demand, including demand by new power plants;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> (XII) notes that Bord Gáis Éireann has been given approval to proceed with the construction of a second gas interconnector from Scotland as well as completion of the ring main and for extension of the gas pipeline network to the north-west;</P>
    <P>(XIII) recalls the publication of the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which sets a target of 500Mw of renewable sourced electricity generation plant between 2000 and 2005 and notes the imminent announcement of an alternative energy requirement competition aimed at providing a market mechanism for, in excess of, 240MW of such electricity generating plant over the next two years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will try to be positive as I can towards the Deputy. I thank the Opposition for putting down the motion. It is timely and proper that the Minister of State and myself should be here to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government, the Minister of State and I fully recognise the importance of energy, including infrastructure and supply, to the country's economic growth and development. The Government remains strongly committed to the ongoing provision of a reliable and secure supply of energy at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>There has been a record level of growth in demand for energy in the past five years. This growth is firm evidence of the underlying record performance of the economy, which is an indication of the success of the Government's economic policies. Our energy supply has been the subject of considerable media coverage in recent times and there is a certain amount of confusion in the public mind about it. While I do not want to appear complacent, I want to make clear that we are not short of generating capacity. The amount of power at our disposal continues to exceed the level of peak demand. I did not make that up &ndash; the ESB said it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows I know what it means. I acknowledge that margins have been contracting, but this is a by-product of the exceptional growth we have experienced. The situation has been competently managed by the electricity regulator, CER, the ESB and ESB National Grid this winter and neither the general public nor industry has suffered any interruptions or shortages, apart from interruptions which arose from normal maintenance and repair, localised storm damage or builders digging up cables. On the basis of an initiative by my Department, the ESB installed a number of mobile generators last year. That proved successful in giving the company additional flexibility in managing peak demand. I am pleased to be able to tell Members <Col N="576" /> that my Department has already taken a further initiative for next winter with Mr. Tom Reeves and the Commission for Electricity Regulation and asked it to take the necessary steps to ensure that all demands for power are met during the coming winter. The CER's plans in this regard are well advanced.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that ESB national grid has met and continues to meet all demands for power supply. There is, however, a clear acceptance that additional generating capacity needs to come on stream as soon as possible. The House will be aware that the new ESB-Statoil plant at Ringsend and the new Viridian plant are expected to come on stream in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I am sure the Minister does not intend to mislead the House, but my information is that the two new plants will not come on stream until 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only tell the Deputy what Viridian and the ESB told me. If I am told tomorrow that these plants will not come on stream next year, I will correct the record. However, both firms told me this evening that would be the case. These plants will offer a significant additional tranche of generating capacity and will help to restore the operating capacity margins to normal levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country's energy infrastructure has served us well but there is no doubt that the unprecedented growth of recent years has imposed a significant additional load upon the system. The country's electricity networks were designed essentially for another age. The distribution network dates largely from the era of rural electrification, while the high voltage transmission network has remained largely unchanged since the early 1980s. There is no doubt that the unprecedented growth of recent years has brought us to a point where a massive programme of investment is now clearly required. The programme proposed by EirGrid for the next five years will involve an investment of £0.5 billion and, when completed, will provide the country with a robust transmission system to international standards. This does not take account of any additional investments that may be required in the light of regional development requirements and the national spatial strategy currently being developed. In the case of the distribution system, the ESB investment programme for the next five <Col N="577" /> years will be £1.5 billion. That investment will also bring about significant improvements in the network and the process will be ongoing with further investment during the second half of the decade.</P>
    <P>As regards the gas infrastructure, Deputies will have noted from the recent press release that the Government has decided that Bord Gáis should proceed with the construction of a second interconnector from Scotland. The Government has also approved the extension of the gas network to the north-west. We will have to move on to the areas represented by Deputies Crawford and Boylan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>These projects, coupled with BGE's projects to complete the Ringmain and a pipeline from Mayo to Galway, represent a massive investment in our gas infrastructure. This investment, taken together with the investment already mentioned in relation to electricity, will provide the country with an energy infrastructure well into the early decades of this century which is capable, with ongoing maintenance and upgrading, of meeting all demands from users and underpinning continuing economic growth.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government last year appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to look at the question of infrastructure development and planning in the context of the national development plan. The establishment of that sub-committee is a clear indication of the overriding importance the Government attaches to the issue of infrastructure provision. Senior officials in the Department made a detailed presentation on energy infrastructure to a meeting of this sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, on Wednesday, 7 March. The recent rejection by ESB network technicians of new work practices, including the use of outside contractors, was discussed at the meeting and the ESB gave a commitment that the company was working intensively to ensure a positive turnaround in the situation to allow the unlimited use of contractors in order to deliver in full on the company's infrastructure investment programme. It is of critical importance that it succeeds in its efforts. The outcome of the meeting was a decision by the Taoiseach and other Ministers, including myself, that energy infrastructure provision is to be monitored and tracked from here on, with the State companies concerned being required to account to the Cabinet sub-committee through my Department on a quarterly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is public opposition in parts of the country on planning and environmental grounds to putting in place the infrastructure needed to underpin our energy supply. Previous speakers mentioned this topic. Elected representatives can <Col N="578" /> play a useful role in creating a greater public awareness and acceptance of the need for infrastructure provision to allow economic growth and inward investment to be maintained.</P>
    <P>There has been a reference to the demand for electricity from data hosting or web farms, as they are sometimes called. These plants can consume as much electricity as a small town. These web farms are a relatively recent development and are capable of fairly rapid start-up. Other countries in Europe have difficulty in meeting such large increases in demand at short notice. However, I am happy to be able to tell the House that the ESB has already made arrangements to put in five large new substations at an early date to cater for a number of these data centres in the Dublin area. This is the area where applications have arisen to date for power supply for web farms. None have been turned away and the ESB, in conjunction with my Department and the development agencies, including IDA Ireland and Forfás, has responded rapidly to the requests for power.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the liberalisation of energy markets. I have demonstrated this in the electricity industry by the actions I have taken to promote competition. In July 1999 I sponsored the Electricity Regulation Act as the first urgent step in the process of liberalisation. This legislation repealed regulatory powers that had been vested in the ESB and established the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation to oversee market opening and to regulate access to the grid. In December 2000 I signed the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000 which implemented the remainder of the electricity directive and which, in the main, provided for the establishment of an independent transmission system operator to be known as Eirgrid. I have also decided upon accelerated liberalisation of the electricity market, moving to 40% in 2002, with full market opening in February 2005.</P>
    <P>The 5% shareholding allocated to the ESB workers is the only item of business from the tripartite arrangement of 1996 left undone. This has greatly exercised ESB employees and rightly so. We had hoped that the last remaining ESB legislation would have embraced that. The legislation to allow the ESB to give the shares to the employees was passed by the Cabinet today so it should be in the pigeonholes by tomorrow afternoon. It is a very short Bill and I thank the Attorney General and the draftspeople in his office for the way they have attended to it. It will be available to the public and the Deputies tomorrow. I hope that we will be able, through the good offices of the Whips of the Fine Gael, Labour, Green and Progressive Democrats parties, to fix a date next week to deal with the legislation as there are only two weeks left of the Dáil term. I did not realise that we could not take it <Col N="579" /> next week in the Séanad because it must be printed first on the other sheet of paper.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very simple and gives workers their due. That tripartite agreement has been succeeded by a second agreement concluded in the winter of 1999-2000, which gave the go-ahead for the liberalisation of the market. I am glad we have been able to get this Bill ready and hope that goodwill will be shown towards the measure, which essentially gives force to the last remaining provision of the 1996 agreement.</P>
    <P>In summary, demands for energy are being met, but there is no room for complacency. The steps being taken, particularly the accelerated investment and the new monitoring and reporting requirement to the Cabinet, are designed to ensure that all demands for energy will continue to be met.</P>
    <P>My next comments are not directed towards the Deputy in a hostile fashion. I did, however, undertake to clear the record on the matter. Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> carried claims by an Opposition spokesman that, &ldquo;data hosting centres are being asked regularly by the ESB to switch off during peak electricity demand hours&rdquo;. As a matter of normal operating practice, energy utilities the world over, including the ESB for many decades, operate a system of interruptible tariffs to help at times of peak demand. There is nothing unusual or abnormal about this. Customers who use large amounts of electricity can agree in advance to have their power supply interrupted for very short periods of usually no more than an hour. There is a commercial advantage for participating companies, who benefit from a lower electricity tariff. It is an entirely voluntary matter for companies, who participate freely and for commercial reasons. Companies which do not wish to participate are not obliged to do so and are provided with whatever power they require. I have checked with the ESB, which this evening advised me that no web farms currently avail of this facility and none has ever been asked to accept power interruptions.</P>
    <P>I was in Opposition too and I know that spokespersons need to say their piece because their job depends on getting it into newspapers, getting it listened to and getting it read. That is all part of the cut and thrust of politics and I genuinely understand it. The piece in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Data hosting centres are crucial to the government's plans to make Ireland the e-hub of Europe. Yet in Dublin data hosting centres are being asked regularly by the ESB to switch off during peak electricity demand hours.</P>
    <P>I have checked the matter and no web farms currently avail of that facility and none has been asked to accept power interruptions. In the light of this assurance by the ESB, it is important to <Col N="580" /> set the record straight before we all receive letters saying we got our facts wrong.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to doubt the veracity of the ESB in this matter. Why should I? I asked the ESB after that. The Deputy can contact the ESB if he disbelieves me. I am advised by the ESB that no web farms currently avail of this facility and none has been asked to accept power interruptions. If the Deputy has information to the contrary, I will certainly take it up with the ESB. For now, I will accept that information as correct.</P>
      <P>I neglected to say when I started that I wished to give ten minutes of my time to Deputy Sean Power if that is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it important that we have a contribution from a Power considering the matter we are discussing here tonight. We had protests outside this House on Friday last, during which one of the ushers received a little blow. It would do no harm for this House to send him its best wishes and wish him a speedy recovery so that he can return to his business around the Houses as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion acknowledges the importance of power in securing the future. I have been trying to tell the same thing to the electorate in south Kildare, but unfortunately Deputies Dukes and Wall have a different story to tell. We are all familiar with the great growth in our economy in recent years. This success has brought with it some problems, one of which is meeting the ever increasing energy demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the Fine Gael motion states: &ldquo;Noting the slow progress in the implementation of the deregulation of the energy generation market . . . condemns the Government for its failure to plan adequately for the energy needs of the economy&rdquo;. Fine Gael has a cheek to be so critical of the Government. A comparison of the records of this Government and the previous one will show that this Government wins handsomely. The previous Government agreed with the EU directive on market liberalisation, which provided for a supply market opening of 30% in February 2000, increasing to 33% in 2003, and to review the situation in 2006. This Government has accelerated the opening of the supply market ahead of EU directive requirements to 40% in 2002 and intends to fully open the market by 2005. The necessary legislation has been introduced and the ESB has provided 600 megawatts of power for auction to enable new entrants to develop a cus<Col N="581" /> tomer base prior to the construction of their plant. Following deregulation, responsibility for security of supply is no longer in the hands of the ESB. However, as a leading supplier, the company is acutely aware of the critical importance of adequate and reliable electricity to the continued growth of the economy and the large energy requirements of key technological sectors, particularly in the major growth area of data hosting.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred earlier to planning and environmental difficulties, of which we have had experience in County Kildare. A consortium comprising a Finnish-based energy company, Elf Aquitaine Gas &ndash; part of the French Elf Group &ndash; and Bord na Móna, applied to construct a gas-fired power station in Dunstown, a few miles outside Naas. These well known companies have substantial experience in the area of energy provision. The Finnish company, which is very active in the supply of oil and gas, employs more than 18,000 people world wide and is involved in more than 50 power stations. It was also involved in the construction of the new peat-fired station in Offaly. The French company is recognised as a world leader in hydro-carbon exploration and production and is a big player in the French and British gas markets. Bord na Móna is a key player in Ireland's energy industry, supplying peat to power stations and manufacturing briquettes. One would expect that a proposal from a consortium with that type of experience would be well researched. The brochure circulated to residents in the Dunstown area included a section entitled &ldquo;Fitting in With the Environment&rdquo;. It stated:</P>
    <P>An important part of our plan is the landscaping of the entire area surrounding the proposed new power station. We will be maintaining the beautiful tree line which surrounds the site. This will be carried out not only to minimise the visual impact but also to make this facility something our neighbours can be proud of.</P>
    <P>This site is located in a very rural part of County Kildare and the residents rejected the proposal out of hand. The proposed plant would cover almost 250,000 square feet and stand 100 feet high &ndash; the same height as Croke Park &ndash; with a smoke stack height of more than 160 feet. The plant would be visible for miles around, irrespective of any plantation. I am convinced the site, purchased in what appears to have been a sweetheart deal, was chosen because it was cheap as it does not have any other apparent benefits. Many local residents are concerned that the plant would have a negative impact on their lives and that its presence would adversely affect property prices. Kildare County Council unsuccessfully sought a material contravention and the matter is currently with An Bord Pleanála which will adjudicate on it in the near future. While I recognise the necessity for additional generating capacity, <Col N="582" /> attempting to enforce monstrosities such as this on rural Ireland will meet considerable resistance. Similar difficulties have been experienced in Cork and we must consider alternative options.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins's contribution was very negative. Together with other Opposition spokespersons, he cited comments made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on her recent trip abroad. The level of economic growth in recent years was unexpected. Web farms and data centres have huge energy requirements and it is important these are met. The Minister indicated that neither the general public nor industry suffered interruptions or shortages other than those which would normally occur in the course of maintenance or repair work. Opposition Members always see the barrel as being half empty but they should adopt a more realistic approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Jobs will not be threatened due to inadequate electricity supplies. If we continue to increase our generating capacity, we will not face any immediate difficulties. The ESB is engaged in a major investment programme which will see it spending £2 billion over the next five years, one quarter of which will be spent on the grid, with the remaining £1.5 billion being spent on the distribution network which conducts electricity to our homes, farms and businesses. This investment will significantly improve our energy infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the establishment of the ESB to deal with the needs of a different era. We should not let this occasion pass without acknowledging the huge task the company faced in 1927 when it was requested to develop an electricity industry in Ireland. The company subsequently worked with Bord na Móna in the establishment of a number of peat-fired stations which provided much needed employment and used native fuel to provide guaranteed electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg will be familiar with the power station in Allenwood, County Kildare, which was due to close on a number of occasions but was resuscitated by successive Ministers. The station finally closed in the mid-1990s at which stage the area's future looked very bleak. To give it credit, the ESB did not simply walk away. It provided funding to ensure that alternative industry was found for the area. In December 1999, the Allenwood Community Development Association Limited took possession of the ESB site and more than 60 people are currently employed in small local industries. There is also an information office on site which is regularly used by local people who have a sense of ownership of the association. The association has submitted an application to the county council for a community-based child care facility which, if successful, will be the first of its kind in the area. I wish it well with its application as we can all appreciate the need for child care facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> I commend Bord Gáis on the extension of the gas network throughout the country, from which a number of towns in County Kildare have benefited. The second gas interconnector from Scotland will ensure the network can be extended to an increasing number of homes and businesses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time and support the amendment before the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely motion which raises questions of extreme national importance. The motion provides the House with an opportunity to examine systematically the record of the Government and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, especially, on the ESB and energy provision in general. It will not be an enjoyable exercise for the Minister whose failings and prevarication on critical issues have been a major contributory factor to the imminent crisis facing the country. The Minister cannot deny that the energy generation supply network has been running on a wing and a prayer for the past three years. The fact that major electricity blackouts have not occurred is due in the main to good luck. However, the possibility of blackouts for domestic and industrial customers is still very real and, due to ministerial neglect, will remain with us for the next two years at least.</P>
      <P>The crisis in the electricity industry not only affects existing customers but has a devastating effect on the ability of the Government to plan a rational and balanced regional policy for the country. The failings of the Government have contributed directly to the chronic overcrowding of the east coast and of the Dublin region especially. Major obstacles towards the social and economic development of the western seaboard and the Border and midlands regions are being erected. Towns throughout these regions cannot attract investment or industry because the basic power requirements of industrial development cannot be met. The aims of the national development plan and the forthcoming national spatial plan will remain little more than pious gestures due to the energy crisis of which we are in the middle. This is disastrous for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Energy supply is critical to balance social and economic development. The technical parlance is spatial planning. My party recently produced a blueprint for the future development of the country. Energy infrastructure is an integral part of that plan. Without developing our energy infrastructure, the untenable expansion of Dublin will continue unabated as will all the resulting social <Col N="584" /> disasters, such as traffic chaos, the inexorable rise in house prices and rents and increasing environmental pollution. Meanwhile, the continued economic depression and emigration which have linked many towns in the west will carry on apace. The regional apartheid which exists will deepen and will condemn the western seaboard to being little more than a holiday retreat for Europe's wealthiest because it will have been denuded of the industrial development necessary to provide families and young people with a viable future in their local communities. Since taking office, the Minister has failed utterly to grasp this reality. In her tenure she has actively encouraged the process I have just described, and it can be justly described as regional apartheid.</P>
    <P>There is an energy crisis in the country and the extent of that crisis cannot be denied by the Minister. I will place the basic facts on record. It is unlikely we will be able to meet the demand from existing customers and they will be obliged to restrict the use of electricity before new generating plants are commissioned. We will not be able to meet the 10% growth in demand from new customers and the increased demand from existing customers. One third of the country cannot be supplied with the electricity required for high energy commercial users. With the growth in demand and given the planned additional generating capacity, in five years' time, two thirds of the country will be unable to supply new large scale energy users. If an Intel wants to locate in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, it cannot do so because the energy it requires is not available to it. Many other such projects which could go to the west, thereby reducing the pressure on Dublin, cannot locate there because their energy requirements cannot be supplied. Even if the generating capacity were available, the creaking transmission network would be incapable of transporting the electricity needed. These are facts.</P>
    <P>This is the disastrous situation for which the Minister must be held to account. The seriousness of it cannot be understated. The shortage of electricity supply more than any other factor, such as labour supply or a slowdown in the economy in the United States, has the potential to stop the Celtic tiger in its tracks. Despite this, in the past four years, the Minister has done nothing to deal with this problem. The chronic problems in electricity supply have been raised repeatedly by me and Deputy Jim Higgins during Question Time. At all times the Minister has been anxious to adopt a hands off approach to the issue. For a Minister who is almost indecently anxious to be seen as the mother goddess of electronic commerce, she demonstrates a severe aversion to taking a hands on responsibility for anything as unattractive or traditional as electricity supply. There lies part of the answer to the crisis we face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The Minister's handling of relations with the ESB, her failure to sanction actively generation projects urgently needed by the ESB and her refusal to honour her part of the cost and competitiveness review are major contributory factors. Neglect, lethargy and prevarication have been the hallmarks of the Minister's tenure where electricity supply is concerned. I am anxious the House is not fooled by suggestions that the ESB did not do its job well. It was not allowed to do it well because the Minister was on her knees adoring at the altar of competition and refusing to allow the ESB to build the stations and install the transmission systems it said were necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the Minister's failure to promote quickly generation projects urgently needed and proposed by the ESB. Three years ago, anticipating the pressure on supply during the winter of 2000-01 and beyond, the ESB advised the Minister and her Department of the need for a new 400MW station. The proposed station in Ringsend would be a joint venture between the ESB and Statoil. However, the Minister refused to give the go ahead for the station until 26 May last year, three years later. She argued repeatedly and stridently in the House that she could not give permission for this power station. Suddenly on 26 May last year when a crisis was upon us, she could give permission. Had she given it at the time it was requested, the power station would now be built and supplying electricity. This decision means not only will the station not be ready for this winter, it will not be ready for the following one. The Minister's statement that it will be ready before the following winter is wrong on the basis of the information I have from the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fumbling on this issue was astounding. Rather than taking action to ensure continuity of supply, she ran for cover and used the technical details of the EU electricity directive to avoid taking action; this was before legislation establishing the new Commission for Electricity Regulation was introduced in the House. Her interpretation of the EU directive was conservative and self-serving and I said so at the time. There is no way the terms of the EU directive opening up only part of the electricity market to competition was intended to stymie essential infrastructural developments for three years, something which has contributed directly to the crisis we face now and into the future. Not one of our EU partners placed a moratorium on infrastructural development until a competitive market was introduced. The Minister's unique decision was viewed in many circles as a deliberate measure targeted at the ESB and designed to frustrate its development plans. Thousands of ESB customers were used as pawns in the Minister's battle of wills with the ESB, and these customers may well have to pay the price for her foolishness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Already this winter the ESB was forced to hire five emergency generators of 100MW capacity to prevent blackouts. That is crisis management. This arrangement, which would not have been necessary if the Minister had given the go ahead for the Ringsend station in 1998, cost the company £20 million. ESB customers will have to foot this unnecessary and costly bill. A further £21 million will be spent next winter on the leasing of seven gas turbines of 160 MW capacity to meet generating shortfall. Even with this costly investment, we cannot be assured that blackouts will not take place. We are into crisis management, and it is a crisis created by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister's prevarication over the Ringsend project is one example, albeit a costly one, of her antagonism towards the ESB and her failure to support essential projects, an extraordinary stance for the shareholder of a company to take. The same prevarication was abundantly evident in the approval of the gas interconnector with Scotland. A decision on this key infrastructural development was needed two years ago at the latest.</P>
    <P>However, yet again, the Minister appeared to be too busy to make a decision. Perhaps her interminable rows with other semi-State companies proved too time consuming.</P>
    <P>The development and bringing on stream of this critical energy supply source is now seriously behind schedule and the contribution the connector could make to our current crisis is seriously diminished. I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who took this project by the scruff of the neck and fought tooth and nail with his senior Cabinet colleagues to ensure a Government decision was taken. He eventually got the decision and I pay tribute to him because he fought the issue alone for a long time.</P>
    <P>The recent ownership change debate in the ESB has highlighted the frustration throughout the organisation with the lethargy demonstrated by the Minister. The management document submitted to that process was more a vote of no confidence in the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, than a vote of confidence in the public flotation process. In summary, the management proposal highlighted the need for either a radical change in the role played by the Government as shareholder, involving a willingness to provide equity capital to support a significant internationalisation plan and to provide real commercial freedom, or to pursue a change of ownership. Damningly, the document concluded that, in the light of experience to date, the scale of change required in the current shareholder relationship is unlikely and this supported a change of ownership under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, must have been delighted when she saw the proposal as her long-running campaign of inaction appeared to have eventually forced the ESB management to <Col N="587" /> conclude that only by selling off the company could the ESB get the dead hand of the Minister off its back. I am delighted the management conclusion was not accepted by the board and that wiser counsel from the group of unions held sway on this occasion. However, the long-term agenda of the Minister and her reasons for frustrating the development of the ESB have become clear as a result of this internal debate regarding future ownership of the company.</P>
    <P>The frustration and annoyance of the management of the ESB is only surpassed by the workers of the company. The groundbreaking tripartite CCR agreement was reached in May 1996. The full benefits of that agreement have not been reaped and responsibility for this failing lies solely with the Minister. The CCR agreement provided the staff of the ESB with a 5% shareholding in the company. If nothing else, Deputy Higgins' motion flushed out the Minister earlier when she announced that she would introduce a short Bill to give the workers the rights secured under that agreement in 1996.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister and the Government are too willing to rush legislation through the House that changes the status of semi-State companies when the prospect of privatisation beckons. An example is the legislation regarding the ICC Bank that was rammed through the House before Christmas. However, when it comes to the Government introducing promised legislation to honour its commitments to ESB workers in 1996, no such determination exists. The Minister has purposefully let down the workers in the ESB and it may be her intention to promote dissent within the company. The plans of the ESB to take emergency action to meet the needs of web farms in the Dublin area in particular are being delayed specifically because the Minister has not honoured her part of the CCR. The ESB wants to outsource the building of six 110 kV stations within a year in the Dublin region to service this intensive and growing sector of the economy. However, the unions have yet to agree to this outsourcing and the failure to date to give the workers the 5% of the company to which the Minister signed up is a major obstacle to progress.</P>
    <P>Through a deliberate policy of inaction, indecision and neglect, the Minister for Public Enterprise has directly contributed to the energy crisis facing the country. This crisis places our future economic and social progress in grave jeopardy. The Government should take a number of urgent steps and if the Minister will not take them, the Taoiseach should find someone who is capable of the task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate as I worked on the Electricity Regulation Bill with Deputy Stagg and the <Col N="588" /> Fine Gael Party and because I have frequently called in the House for energy conservation measures, including the Bill relating to the energy centre. I represent the Dublin North constituency where rural electrification began in Oldtown, but it has experienced many black outs in recent times.</P>
      <P>The motion is too narrowly focused. There is no mention of the cost of the Kyoto protocol or the possibility of energy savings. The energy centre said household efficiency alone would yield £75 million a year if the country got its act together. Other EU countries look at Ireland with envy because it is a wind abundant island and has a long wave and tide abundant coastline. However, while Denmark generates 2,300MW from wind, Ireland only generates 93MW from this source. Ireland's best target is another 500 MW in the next five years. While Ireland gets 1% of its electricity from wind, Denmark gets 7%, with an aim of 50% by 2030, from this source. At times, it is difficult to imagine that it intermittently gets 100% of its energy from wind during winter periods.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a national spatial plan with energy conservation as a key ingredient. Building regulations and building construction must be energy efficient. For example, the use of hollow blocks in construction is inefficient, but they are used in more than 90% of the new houses built every year. They must give way to energy efficient materials. Regulations should be introduced urgently to maximise solar design in new buildings in their planning and lay out and much higher standards of insulation need to be implemented, particularly in the context of the current building boom. Otherwise, people will live for decades to come in inefficient, heat wasting homes. Grants and subsidies are needed to promote energy efficiency and rating for all premises.</P>
      <P>Our increasing reliance on fossil fuels is a dead end policy. At present, more than 75% of our energy is generated from imported fossil fuels. By 2010, current policy will lead to 90% of our energy being generated from imported fuel. What will happen if there is another Gulf war or the price increases? What will happen when that fuel eventually runs out? We will be left with the legacy of inefficiency and short-term thinking.</P>
      <P>The companies that will be competitive in the future are those that are low energy users and energy efficient. This should be the focus of the debate. Ultimately, the greenhouse gas burden we are building up for this and future generations will cost us dearly. The story in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 November which stated that, according to an insurance expert, global warming may bankrupt the world is not a false warning. It is the reality and if we are to jump out of the pan, we should at least jump clear and not into the fire.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the ridiculously short time available to me &ndash; I am getting used to trying to cram much into a short time &ndash; I will make one point. A supply of electricity that is consistent and regular is critical for homes, public services and industrial development. However, the Fine Gael Party's motion and the Government amendment slavishly repeat the mantra of the big business driven marketplace that deregulation and privatisation of the electricity generating capacity is somehow crucial to the supply of adequate electricity. Both conservative parties, as evidenced in the motion and the amendment, are trying to outdo each other in their worship of this myth. For the Fine Gael Party, deregulation is not happening fast enough, while the Government says there will be full deregulation by 2005.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins and other Fine Gael Party speakers pointed to the electricity generating crisis in California a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, they did not draw the lesson that deregulation has proved a disaster for the residents of California and businesses there. Consumers in California pay the highest rates in the US and the private conglomerates which dominate electricity generation are abusing and manipulating the market to the detriment of consumers. In contrast, Sacramento and Los Angeles still have publicly owned generating capacity and their rates have not increased to anything like the same extent. In the home of world capitalism in the US, there is now a demand for public ownership of the biggest electricity generator in California.</P>
      <P>Electricity generation in Ireland should continue in public ownership in a developed way. It should be opened to democratic control with more workers and consumer representatives on the board. The board should be dominated by the future needs of society and in investing in environmentally compatible generation. That is the alternative to the gallop for privatisation and deregulation which will prove equally disastrous in the long-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in the House this evening this important matter affecting thousands of our young citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In ministerial reply after ministerial reply in this House, questioning Deputies have been fobbed off by the standard insurance industry mantra that the putative level of insurance costs for young drivers is a function of the claims record, especially of young male drivers, and effectively there is nothing in EU rules the Minister can do about it. The record shows that no month has passed without this issue being pressed <Col N="590" /> at the relevant Question Time and the Minister doing his ritual handwashing exercise. To make matters worse, the most prominent figures in the industry have attended in sequence before the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and defended the inordinate costs levied on young drivers by reference to their claims ratio which they said made any reduction not viable.</P>
    <P>If <i>The Irish Times</i> report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board findings is correct, the position of the industry has been at a minimum misleading and the position of the Minister of State naive and foolish. He must now tell the House why he continued to regurgitate the traditional excuse for inaction, even after he received the Motor Insurance Advisory Board preliminary report last July. The industry must explain why, although it had full knowledge of the MIAB report, its leading figures appeared before an Oireachtas Select Committee over recent months and stuck to their original position. Meanwhile tens of thousands of young people, who in most cases need a car to get to work, are expected to bear burdensome and crushing insurance costs because the testimony of the industry that it is an unprofitable enterprise is relied upon by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is all too tragically true that the rate of accidents among young male drivers in particular is alarmingly high. However, both the Minister of State and the industry must now explain why the MIAB has apparently concluded that young drivers are virtually the most profitable segment of the market. They must explain if it is true that young female drivers contributed on average £730 per annum per person to profitability. If those figures are accurate, the position of the industry is a disgraceful misrepresentation of the true position. The recklessness and appalling record of some young male drivers ought not be allowed distort the fact that tens of thousands of responsible young drivers are being punished on the fraudulent basis that they constitute an inherent loss making segment of the market.</P>
    <P>This is a very significant issue of public interest. Some young people are expected to pay more for annual insurance cover than they paid for the motor vehicle being insured. If the MIAB report is borne out, they are victims of grave misrepresentation by the industry in which the Minister of State, knowingly or otherwise, is complicit. This revelation is reminiscent of the discovery a few years ago that in their annual presentation of the Blue Book the industry conveniently excluded reference to investment income. It is now time for a detailed examination of practices in the industry and for immediate alleviation of the burdens unfairly imposed on young drivers.</P>
    <P>It is especially regrettable that, in his remarks on the Order of Business today, the Taoiseach lapsed into the old waffle that the figures are in dispute and came out essentially on the side of <Col N="591" /> the industry. Nor did he make any attempt to explain why his Minister sat on the draft report since last July while the members of the Oireachtas committee were made fools of by the industry. He might have explained why the Personal Injuries Tribunal report initiative, which he today confused with the MIAB report, has taken almost four years to win the approval of his reluctant Minister who, it must be said, has never shown that the consumers, young or old, are his first priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I set up the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998 to examine the factors that influence the cost of motor insurance and, in particular, the relationship between the premiums charged to different categories of drivers and the claims experience of those categories. The board is chaired by Ms Dorothea Dowling, claims manager of Coras Iompair Éireann and a Fellow of the Chartered Insurance Institute, with 15 years experience in this industry in both Dublin and London . The board members are representative of all the various groups interested in motor insurance, including representatives of consumers, commercial motorists, young drivers, the Garda, Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, driver trainers, the motor industry and, of course, the insurance industry, including brokers.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board submitted its interim report to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment last June. The board was conscious that the data on which it had based its interim report was incomplete and that the findings were, therefore, tentative. Thus, the interim report clearly stated that the board required access to the individual raw data before any firm conclusions could be reached. I want to categorically contradict what Deputy Rabbitte has tried to portray here this evening, that is, that the MIAB has apparently concluded its business. The MIAB has not concluded its business. Furthermore, it became clear last October that there were serious deficiencies in the raw data. The board took the view that the flawed information compromised the already tentative conclusions of its report and brought this fact to my immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, the data concerning claims experience in various categories of drivers did not cover the whole market. The MIAB considered that the missing data were very significant and could have a serious impact on its analysis. In addition, it was not clear that the data adequately identified different categories of driver. In particular, it was not clear that women drivers were always separately identified. The challenges in producing accurate data largely arose because the centralised IT system the insurance industry used to <Col N="592" /> deliver the necessary data had difficulties in coping with mergers in the insurance industry which had necessitated integration of sometimes very different computer systems. It appears that these difficulties have been resolved and that the insurance industry is now in a position to deliver accurate data to the MIAB.</P>
    <P>Once the board was in a position to confirm that the insurance industry would be supplying up-to-date accurate data, to facilitate the board's analysis of that data and the completion of its task, I extended the appointment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board until the end of 2001. It is vital that any consideration by this Government of issues arising from the levels of motor insurance premiums should be on an accurate and well informed basis. I respectfully suggest that Members of this House, rather than playing politics with this serious issue, reflect on facts rather than fiction.</P>

      <P>We decided last week to prepare for the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board, to reduce the high cost of delivering personal injury compensation. Research undertaken by the MIAB indicates that a high proportion of outlay on injury claims is absorbed by fees paid to lawyers and other professional experts. It should be noted that for every £100 compensation paid for injury in motor accidents an extra 40% goes on professional fees.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to reduce accident frequency. While there is still some way to go and accident rates remain too high, particularly in view of their human cost, we are achieving real progress, particularly when the rates of accidents are compared with the significant rate of growth in car ownership. Car numbers have risen from 828,000 in 1996 to approximately 1.3 million today. I trust these facts put the matter in context.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue publicly. Despite the seriousness of the matter and the severity of the blast, which could have had lethal consequences, there appeared to be a conspiracy of silence surrounding this event. I do not believe there was a conspiracy and perhaps the reason for the silence was the sheer disbelief by the contractor that this could have happened a second time.</P>
      <P>However incredible the event, local residents have been left in the dark for almost a week in terms of the circumstances surrounding it. All that is known is that at 6 p.m. last Wednesday a blast warning was given in the normal way and the normal blast took place. A half an hour or so later when workers had gone home &ndash; luckily there were only a few AMCO employees still on the site &ndash; a huge unexplained and unplanned explosion took place. This explosion shook houses in the locality and set off many house alarms. There were no injuries but I am convinced that if last Wednesday night had not been extremely cold and wet there would have been injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The initial reaction to phone calls to the site office the next morning was that nothing had happened. It was subsequently admitted that something had happened but no information was available other than it was being investigated. On Friday, two days after this frightening explosion, the Health and Safety Authority issued a statement saying it had been informed by the Garda of an incident on the Southern Cross and it was investigating it. An incident is an altercation between two drunks outside a pub. This was not an incident; it was a serious accident, a massive explosion, which requires more by way of explanation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Health and Safety Authority for the speed with which it moved onto the site to withdraw the licence of the blasting company. I understand it is carrying out a thorough investigation and considering legal proceedings. There is a terrible sense of <i>déja vu</i> about this explosion. There was a full investigation after the first explosion last September, a file was prepared for the DPP and new procedures were put in place. A few months later at the beginning of the next series of blasts there was another accident in what appears to have been exactly the same circumstances. The first accident left three people injured, including a young garda who has permanent hearing loss. Much damage has been done to local houses and many people feel aggrieved that they did not get what they were promised. There are serious worries about the long-term impact of the explosion on their homes. The first accident should never have happened and it defies belief that there should have been a second explosion on the same site in the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>The use of explosives is a serious business and I and other members of the public attended meetings prior to the commencement of the project. Concerns about the possibility of damage during blasting were dismissed and we were assured that there would be extreme vigilance, the strictest of procedures would be applied and the use of explosives was now such a precise science that accidents could not happen. I do not raise this matter to apportion blame as that is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority. Rather I raise it because what has happened does not inspire confidence that future blasting can be undertaken safely. The next phase of the project, the M50, is due to start shortly. It not only involves a huge amount of blasting but the blasting will take place in close proximity to homes and offices in a built-up and densely populated area.</P>
    <P>The challenge for the Minister is to restore confidence in the blasting process. This accident also has implications for other projects such as the port tunnel and the metro. Concerns have already been expressed about disruption and possible damage caused by planned blasting. However, <Col N="596" /> the possibility of accidental explosions adds a whole new dimension to these projects. If confidence is to be restored the Minister must give a full public account of precisely what happened on the site last Wednesday, how the strict procedures governing the disposal of explosives and the new procedures were ignored and the procedures which can be put in place to ensure a similar incident will not happen again. The least the public, particularly those who live close to the site, deserve is a detailed explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that my Government and departmental colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, Deputy Kitt, is unavailable because of illness to reply to the debate. I am aware that he is taking a personal interest in this matter and has been in regular contact with the Health and Safety Authority, the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 General Applications Regulations and the 1995 Construction Regulations all provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed. This legislation is enforced in a proactive manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The construction sector is specifically addressed in the context of the 1995 Construction Regulations. These regulations deal with the minimum safety and health requirements on temporary or mobile construction sites and are one of the most detailed legislative frameworks dealing with any one specific sector. Their purpose is to reduce accidents, fatalities and ill health during the construction phase of the project and subsequent maintenance work.</P>
      <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally sound and provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety. It is enforced in a targeted manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources both in terms of staffing and financial assistance which the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has allocated to the authority has enabled it to increase its inspection, enforcement and awareness raising activities with a high proportion being targeted at the construction sector. In addition to the mainstream occupational health and safety legislation to which I have referred, the handling, use and disposal of explosives is also covered under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Extractive Industries) Regulations, 1998, the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, and the Explosives Act, 1875.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Health and Safety Authority has responsibility for monitoring compliance with the above legislation with regard to worker health and safety, the chief inspector of explosives and <Col N="597" /> the Garda Síochána also have a role in ensuring commercial explosives are safely used and disposed of. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, will obviously keep in close contact with it. The authority monitors the procedures for using the explosives and ensures they are up to accepted standards. In addition, the shotfirers, that is, those who set off the explosions, must be adequately trained and follow the set procedures.</P>
    <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875, the chief inspector of explosives must give authorisation to carry out explosions to trained companies. He, in conjunction with the Garda, monitors the security arrangements for all commercial explosives. These arrangements cover the safe transport, under Garda escort, of the explosives to the site. While every effort must be made to use all the explosives on the day they are transported to the site, sometimes this does not happen. In these cases the Garda must ensure that all remaining explosives in opened packages are destroyed on the ground in a controlled manner and that full packages of explosives are returned to the supplier under a Garda escort. When any explosive incident happens these arrangements are investigated to ensure the laws have been fully complied with.</P>
    <P>While the investigation of incidents such as the one referred to by Deputy Mitchell is a day to day matter for the Health and Safety Authority, I am informed that the authority was notified by the Garda on Wednesday night last, 21 March, of an incident which occurred during the construction of the Southern Cross Route Motorway at Black Lane Bridge, Ballinteer.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings are under consideration in respect of this and an earlier incident on the site last summer. A prohibition notice has been served by the authority on AMCO Limited, the explosives sub-contractor on the site, in respect of the use of explosives on this site with effect from 22 March 2001. The main contractor for the project is ASCON.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who lives very close to this site has been in regular contact with the Health and Safety Authority on the matter and they are continuing to monitor the situation on site. In the light of possible legal proceedings being instituted in respect of this incident, and the previous one in September last year, it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any further detail on the matter at this time. However, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being fully and speedily dealt with by the authority and that every effort is being made by the authority's inspectors to determine the cause of this second incident. I can also assure the Deputy that the necessary enforcement action is being and will continue to be taken and that work on the project in question will continue to <Col N="598" /> be closely monitored by the authority's inspectors.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me raise this matter this evening and I am grateful to the Minister for Health and Children for coming into the Dáil to take this debate.</P>
      <P>I was first made aware of this a while ago but last Monday the current situation in regard to the health board was brought home to me dramatically. A mother rang me. She has a child who will soon be six. His doctor has referred him to the child guidance clinic and she was told that, as things are at the moment, she will have to wait almost three years before she will be seen. I want to be helpful and supportive. I know there is a lot of work in the pipeline and that many plans have been made and money made available. I want tonight to ask and encourage the Minister to take a personal interest in this area. He should do everything possible to ensure that these services are brought on stream as quickly as possible. This particular lady is only one of many. I understand that at the moment there are 277 waiting on that list in Cork. The professionals there are working very hard but they need support and they need it urgently.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the working group's report on child and adolescent psychiatric services published last February; it will cost about £90 million to implement. I would encourage and support the Minister in getting all that work completed. It is very urgent. This particular mother is suffering terrible stress. She is afraid the child will be nine before he will be seen. She cannot afford to go privately though she would be willing to take a second job. She is under such stress that her own health is at risk. She asked me to go public with her name and that of her child. I will not do that but I will send the information to the Minister and I have already been in contact with the health board and it is doing all it can to help. This is most urgent.</P>
      <P>We have to intervene at the earliest time when we identify these difficulties children have. The working group's report says that 500 per 200,000 children are affected by attention deficit disorder. Why is this happening? I have dealt with children like that in another capacity and when they reach adolescence it is extremely difficult on them, their parents and their teachers. There is also a need for liaison between schools, community and families in dealing with this. There should be training for families and support for parents, otherwise these children are condemned to a life possibly in jail or worse. I do not want to make a political issue of this but I want to encourage and support the Minister to put maximum resources, effort and time into this issue. It is most urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for his constructive comments. I take this opportunity to appraise the Deputy in relation to the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>In the Southern Health Board child and adolescent psychiatry services are provided jointly by the Brothers of Charity and the board. In March 2000, the board published a comprehensive development plan for child and adolescent psychiatry services for the period 2000-02. This plan makes provision for a total of ten community based, multi-disciplinary consultant led teams for the area. The present position is that the Brothers of Charity have part or all of three teams in place. The board has one consultant led multi-disciplinary team in post and two additional consultants have been offered posts and it is hoped they will be in a position to commence shortly. Steps have also been taken to recruit staff for these two teams. This will result in a total of six community based consultants and part or all of their teams being in place throughout Cork and Kerry later this year.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of the additional consultants and their teams will enable the board and the Brothers of Charity to make progress in relation to waiting lists that have developed in recent years. We are looking at historic deficits here and are trying to catch up as quickly as we can. A clinical priority system is in place at present and appointments are based on this system. In addition, the board has requested the Local Appointments Commission to commence the process of recruitment of six additional posts of psychologist. These additional posts will enhance the board's generic psychology service to children and adolescents in the board's area. A lot here does depend on the success of the recruitment campaign. We have had a shortage of psychologists in terms of availability and I have been working at national level to try and develop manpower force in both short and interim steps to improve recruitment and in more medium term perspective to improve supply.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, additional revenue funding of approximately £1 million had been provided to the board to enhance services in line with its development plan. The board's development plan also provides for the development of a 20 bed in-patient child and adolescent psychiatric unit for the region. The board has located a suitable building and in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Brothers of Charity is currently finalising the brief for the building. It is expected that work on the upgrading and restructuring of this unit, to be based at Bessborough House, will commence later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At national level, I am pleased to inform the <Col N="600" /> Deputy that significant additional funding of £18.64 million has been provided this year for the development of mental health services generally and £3.2 million of this has been directed towards the development of comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric services. I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that £150 million is being provided under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for mental health services. This funding has been made available for the development of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals, day hospitals and day care facilities, community residences and intensive care units for the disturbed mentally ill. Five in-patient units for children and adolescents will also be developed and funded under the NDP. At present, three of the units are at the planning stage, including the unit at Bessborough House referred to earlier, and project teams have been appointed to oversee their implementation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has already referred to the working group which was set up last year to make recommendations on the development of child and adolescent psychiatry. The first report of the group, which I have made available to each Member of the Oireachtas and other interested parties, recommends a significant increase in the number of consultant led multi-disciplinary teams throughout the country. It also recommends that priority should be given, in the first instance, to the recruitment of the required expertise for the completion of existing consultant led multi-disciplinary teams. Additional funding required to fully implement the recommendations of this report will be the subject of discussion in the annual estimates campaigns in respect of 2002.</P>
    <P>We have attempted to make progress and it is a matter of spending the resources we have made available this year. If I can be of any assistance in relation to the cases the Deputy has identified we will do our best to alleviate the distress of the parents concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish this evening to call upon the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular to provide improved policing and increase Garda personnel in the Laois-Offaly Garda division. I would like to congratulate the Garda Síochána at all ranks throughout Laois-Offaly who are doing a very good job. With the resources they have available they are to be complimented on what they have achieved to date. The Garda Síochána work hard. There have been a number of serious crimes in the area including robbery, rape, manslaughter and murder. It has been on top of its job in regard to most of those serious crimes. It got convictions in some, investigations are ongoing in regard to others but overall the Garda Síochána has achieved quite an amount and I pay tribute to it. <Col N="601" /> Many of the sergeants, inspectors and superintendents are active young men and women. It is good that people in their age group are being promoted and recognised for their talents.</P>
      <P>I would be less than honest unless I outlined the anger of many people throughout Laois-Offaly about what is happening in some areas. On his travels to Cork, the Minister, Deputy Martin, passes through Laois-Offaly. As one leaves Monasterevin one enters Laois. From there to Roscrea, one by-passes Portlaoise, but passes through Ballybrittas, Mountrath, the verge of Castletown and Borris in Ossory. There is not a resident garda in any of those villages or towns. In Borris in Ossory there was always a sergeant and three gardaí, most of whom were resident. Sergeant Cullinane and Garda Jack Fahy were resident there but have retired. At present there appears to be one garda attached to Borris in Ossory who is not resident in the village. In Mountrath Sergeant Arthurs has retired, another active garda has been transferred and it appears that the other garda is in the station part time. In that stretch of the N7, the town of Portlaoise, which is by-passed, is the only area which has a resident garda. This is most unsatisfactory. I have spoken with people in the Ballaghmore, Borris in Ossory, Castletown area leading to Rathdowney and Camross and they are angry and frustrated at being forgotten by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Their sense of anger at not having a garda presence is palpable and they consider they have been abandoned by the Government. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Edenderry, which is one of the most rapidly expanding towns in the Laois-Offaly area due to its proximity to Dublin, has only a part time garda service. In Edenderry the garda station closes in the evening and there is not a garda present at night. I have had many representations from the residents of Edenderry especially at weekends. There are young men and young women in Edenderry who are causing problems, yet no ban garda is attached to Edenderry. In the event of ladies being involved in some misdemeanours or fisticuffs or whatever with young men, the Garda are powerless. The male members of the Garda find it impossible to cope. It is a scenario that can go out of hand in the absence of female members to deal with those situations. Fianna Fáil councillors have gone on public record saying they want increased personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Garda Commissioner was to visit Laois and Offaly. He visited Laois but had to postpone his visit to Offaly due to the foot and mouth disease crisis. He said he was working with the resources available to him and that he has had to transfer personnel to the Border due to foot and mouth disease. The Minister should provide additional garda resources to the Garda Com<Col N="602" /> missioner because there is deep dissatisfaction throughout Laois-Offaly. We have suffered as a result of the rural policing scheme. It is most unsatisfactory and it is not working in Laois-Offaly. The Government will have to allocate sufficient personnel and staff to provide an upgraded and improved policing service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the policing arrangements in the Garda division of Laois-Offally.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the issue of Garda strength. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>In respect of overall resources provided to the Garda, the House will be well aware that since the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took office the strength of the force has increased consistently. It has gone up from a figure of 10,800 in 1997 to a current situation where the number of gardaí now exceeds 11,600. Last year, the Government approved the Minister's proposals for a further Garda recruitment competition which is now under way. This latest recruitment competition will fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the strength of the Force to 12,000.</P>
      <P>As well as increasing the strength of the force the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has provided additional financial resources. The provision in the Garda Vote when he took office was £457 million. The provision for this year is more than £690 million. This is a significant increase by any standards.</P>
      <P>Not ever in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, not ever in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those convicted of crime serve their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the question of Garda strength in Laois-Offaly. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the manpower strength of the division, as at 1 January this year was 274 and is due to rise to 275 on 5 April 2001. I am further informed that Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements in place in the Laois-Offaly division are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. In this regard, Garda personnel assigned throughout the Laois-Offaly division, together with overall policing arrangements and <Col N="603" /> operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
    <P>Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Laois-Offaly division, with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained and when additional manpower next becomes available the Deputy can be assured that the needs of the Laois-Offaly division will be fully <Col N="604" /> considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I undertake to convey the views articulated by the Deputy to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is not available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also anxious that the Minister would allocate additional urgently needed Garda personnel to Kilcormac, Ferbane and Clara.</P>

The objective in engaging DKM was to quantify and assess the impact of investment in co-location, complex web hosting, web farming, advanced data processing, and similar e-commerce related facilities on the energy demand and supply situation in Ireland. DKM was also asked to advise on the appropriate investment, regulatory and legislative measures needed to ensure that Ireland remained competitive in attracting and retaining this type of investment.</P>
      <P>My Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and Forfás, commissioned that confidential report. It was finalised at the end of January and its recommendations are being studied. The report has not been formally presented to Government.</P>

I am advised by Aer Rianta that its ongoing £60 million investment programme at Cork Airport is concentrated on the priority areas for development to cater for current growth in passenger traffic such as the terminal expansion project, extra car-parking and extensions to the apron.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta keeps the issue of runway length relative to market needs under constant review in consultation with airline operators. It does not consider that the length of the main runway is constraining the development of Cork Airport.</P>

      <P>There is very close North-South liaison on energy matters, in particularly in the area of gas. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and I have had meetings devoted to energy matters with the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey. Both sides accord a high priority to the North-South dimension of the energy sector. This focus is in keeping with overall Government policy and is being progressed through a consultancy study jointly undertaken by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland. This study is examining the energy markets in both parts of the island with a view to achieving an integrated energy market. There are also regular meetings between my officials and those of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland to inform and, where possible, co-ordinate approaches to the energy sectors of both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The question of extending gas supply from Derry to Donegal depends, in the first instance, on the construction of a Belfast-Derry pipeline, which is a matter for the Northern Ireland Administration. In this context, BGE and Questar, a US gas pipeline company, have presented to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast proposals in relation to the construction of pipelines between Dublin and Craigavon and on to Belfast and from Belfast to Derry. Minister Empey has indicated that he wishes to take time to consider the proposals in detail. I understand that there is a number of complex issues related to the commerciality of the projects to be considered and that this is likely to take some time. My Department will continue to maintain close contact with the Northern Administration and BGE regarding this issue.</P>

      <P>In May 1998, I set an indicative timetable for the construction and completion of the light rail lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. I am satisfied that, based on progress to date, the target date of 2003 for commencement of services will be achieved. Preparatory work, including utilities diversion, has been progressing steadily on the Tallaght to Abbey Street line. The construction of the Red Cow depot is now well under way and on schedule for completion in July 2001. On the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line, property acquisition and preparatory works are also progressing.</P>
      <P>Contractors have been selected for the main construction elements of the project, involving mainly track-laying and cabling for all lines, and this work will commence shortly. The first tram is scheduled for delivery to Dublin in October 2001 and six trams per quarter will be delivered thereafter. The competition to select an operator for the system is progressing with a view to awarding the franchise in October 2001.</P>
      <P>The light rail advisory and action group, that I established to oversee the timetable for the project, reported to me in February 2001. This report is available on the Department's website at www.dpe.ie. The group expressed concerns about the need for inter-agency co-ordination in a number of areas, such as the related developments at St. James's Hospital. I have asked my officials to pursue these matters with the light rail project office and the agencies concerned as a matter of urgency. However, the group has assured me that the target date of 2003 for commencement of passenger services remains feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established in June 1997. The office is responsible for making the liberalised market work in accordance with EU and national law while carrying out its functions of issuing, renewing, enforcing and general administration of licences and managing the frequency spectrum. Full liberalisation took place in Ireland on 1 December 1998. Prior to that, a number of significant areas had been opened to competition. These included the provision of fax, data and value added services &ndash; this area was liberalised in 1992 and more than 50 licences were granted prior to full liberalisation; the provision of mobile telephony networks and services &ndash; in addition to Eircell Limited, a subsidiary of Telecom Éireann, a second mobile telephony operator, Esat Digifone, was licensed in 1996 to operate a digital GSM mobile telephony service &ndash; a competition for the licensing of a combined GSM 900 and GSM 1800 service was conducted in 1998; a third mobile operator Meteor has also subsequently commenced operations; the provision of satellite based telecommunications services; and the provision of infrastructure for already liberalised services.</P>
      <P>Much of the legislation necessary for liberalisation of telecommunications has been introduced through the transposition of EU directives into Irish law. Following a recently completed review of the impact and effectiveness of the earlier directives, five new draft directives are actively under negotiation within the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. It is anticipated that these will be agreed in 2001. In light of these EU reforms and taking into account the Governments regulatory reform programme and the policy document on governance and accountability in the regulatory process, legislation is now being prepared with the objective of enhancing and adapting the telecommunications regulatory framework in order to respond to the rapidly developing market environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 52, 56 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the Retired Aviation Staff Association on 10 October 2000 and senior officials from my Department also met the association on 23 October 2000 to hear details of its claim for enhanced pension benefits for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners. More recently, officials from my Department met the association on 1 March 2001.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pensioners' demands, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta have both indicated that they are not in a position to meet those demands for ongoing costs reasons and as it would also necessitate a substantial capital injection into the pension fund which they cannot afford. Last week, I received correspondence from the Retired Aviation Staff Association revising its claim for enhanced pension entitlements. I am writing to the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta seeking their comments on the latest proposal from RASA.</P>
      <P>In so far as the funding arrangements for the current scheme are concerned, I have been advised that, on the basis of the terms of the scheme, it is not under-funded. According to the most recent actuarial valuation the scheme has a surplus of more than £249 million. Under the rules of the scheme, members pay a contribution calculated as a percentage of their salary. For staff recruited prior to 1970 this contribution is 6.375% while for staff recruited after 1970 it is 5.1% approximately. The employers contribute a similar amount. I have already indicated in replies to a number of parliamentary questions, that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are proposing to establish new pension schemes for their serving staff and pensioners. The terms of the new pension schemes are essentially a matter for the companies concerned to negotiate with staff interests taking account of overall Government policy on public sector pensions, affordability and broader industrial relations priorities for the companies going forward.</P>
      <P>I understand that Aer Lingus will be resuming discussions with staff interests on a new scheme shortly. It is Aer Lingus's intention to implement the new pension scheme as soon as possible after the IPO of the airline is completed. Existing Aer Lingus pensioners who transfer to the new scheme will receive the improved benefits. In so far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company proposes to establish a new scheme as soon as possible in consultation with staff interests.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated, my Department will continue to give careful consideration to the issue of Aer Rianta's corporate future. The issues involved are complex and the options for the future of the company should also have regard to developments generally in the airport sector in Europe and elsewhere. While I remain personally of the view that a minority IPO may be the best option to address Aer Rianta's funding needs in the medium and long-term, I am conscious that there are policy aspects to that option on which I and other Ministers need to reflect carefully.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Aviation Regulation Act is now in force and the framework for independent regulation of airport charges, which is now being pursued by the regulator, will help to clarify the policy debate, since airport charges have been an issue in that debate. As I said in response to earlier questions, my main concern in relation to whatever strategy is decided upon for Aer Rianta is that it is the correct strategy not just for the company itself and its employees but also for the users of the State airports.</P>

      <P>My previous reply was based on information which at the time we were unable to confirm with the German authorities. Since then, the Irish Embassy in Germany has confirmed that a permit issued on 19 January, 2001 for the shipment of three flasks from one power station. This relates to a resumption of suspended activity under existing contractual arrangements. I understand that BNFL have made applications in respect of further shipments.</P>
      <P>Now that the position relating to the permit has been clarified, I will be contacting the German authorities to protest against their decision. I shall also be contacting Ireland's likeminded OSPAR counterparts to enlist their support for a possible unified approach to the German Government. The Irish Government remains totally opposed to the reprocessing activities at Sellafield and I will continue to press the UK Government for a cessation of such activities at the plant.</P>

      <P>Iarnrod Éireann has advised that it expects an interim report of its formal inquiry into the accident of 22 December to be ready by mid April 2001. In relation to the accident of 26 February 2001, the company expects that the interim report will be ready by 6 April 2001. The chief railway inspecting officer has requested that Iarnród Éireann provide him with the findings of these reports as soon as they become available. He has also asked that the findings of the final reports be provided to him as soon as these are finalised.</P>
      <P>In relation to interim measures taken by Iarnród Éireann and my Department, the chief railway inspecting officer visited Kiltoom level crossing on 19 February and noted that Iarnród Éireann had imposed a temporary speed restriction of 25 miles per hour through the level crossing. On 20 February, I directed the railway inspecting officers of my Department to carry out an inquiry under section 7 of the Railways Regulations Act, 1871 into the cause of the railway accident on 16 February, 2001 at Kiltoom level crossing and into the previous accidents at this level crossing. My Department is currently in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office concerning the inquiry.</P>

Part of the strategy provides for the provision of additional suburban stations on the existing rail network, including the coastal suburban line to Wicklow. New diesel railcars will be delivered in 2002 and will allow Iarnród Éireann to provide and improved service on the suburban rail route from Arklow to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, my Department responded to the UK Environment agency's public consultation on the agency's proposals for the future regulation of technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield. The agency's proposals in respect of technetium-99 form part of a wider review by the agency of its authorisations for the discharge of all radioactive waste from Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Technetium-99 is a long-lasting radionuclide, which arises from the reprocessing of Magnox fuel, and is discharged from the Sellafield site to the Irish Sea. The UK Environment agency's consultation paper identified and assessed a number of options which the agency is considering for the future regulation of technetium-99 discharges. The options ranged from reducing immediately the authorised discharge limit for technetium-99 to 10 terabecquerels per year, to retaining the existing limit of 90 terabecquerels per year. In summary, the agency's paper proposed the retention until 2006 of the current discharge limit of 90 terabecquerels per year, which would be reduced to 10 terabecquerels per year from 2006, or earlier, depending on abatement technologies.</P>
      <P>In its response to the agency's consultation paper, my Department, while reiterating the Government's call for a cessation of radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea and for an end to reprocessing, called for an immediate reduction in the discharge authorisation limit for technetium-99 to 10 terabecquerels per year, as being the only option identified in the agency's consultation paper that most closely conforms to the OSPAR strategy commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that in July 1998 the Ministerial meeting of the OSPAR commission adopted a strategy on radioactive discharges <Col N="616" /> which committed all OSPAR Ministers, including the UK Ministers, to the virtual elimination of such discharges to the marine environment by the year 2020 through progressive and substantial reductions in discharges. In announcing the adoption of the strategy, the OSPAR Ministers noted the concerns of a number of the OSPAR contracting parties about technetium-99 discharges and noted that such concerns would be addressed in the UK's forthcoming decisions concerning discharge authorisations for Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Since that strategy was agreed, I have, on several occasions, written to and met with my UK counterparts, and have sought, among other things, an early and significant reduction in the level of discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield. My Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have also monitored progress on this issue in their on-going dealings with their counterparts in the UK.</P>

      <P>Regional airports provide an additional means of access for business and tourism to the regions which they serve. My policy, and that of the Government, is to support the efforts of the regional airports to contribute to regional access. As the Deputy is aware, our strategy to give effect to this policy is manifest through a range of support schemes for the regional airports.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, my Department has enhanced the programme of support for the marketing and promotional efforts of the airports. Over the period 1996-98, the regional airports benefited to the tune of about £600,000 per annum under this scheme, rising to £700,000 in 1999 and to £1.5 million last year. This year, a further sum of £1.5 million is available in financial assistance for the regional airports.</P>
      <P>In addition, a sum of £11 million has been allocated under the national development plan to assist with improving essential facilities at the regional airports. In the coming weeks, my Department will be inviting the regional airport authorities to submit their project proposals for support under this scheme.</P>
      <P>While not intended as a specific support mechanism for the regional airports themselves, my Department also operates the public service obligation programme which supports air access for business and tourism interests to and from the regions. This programme was significantly expanded in January of this year with the addition of the new PSO routes from Dublin to Derry and Knock. The other four PSO routes linking Dublin with Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal were renewed for a further three-year period with extra flights being provided to Kerry and Galway. Exchequer support for this programme has increased more than three fold to over £10 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy study, which is currently being formulated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in consultation with all interested parties, will examine the appropriate role for all forms of transport in regional development in the future. That study will no doubt have regard to the future role of regional air access in the context of balanced regional development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no statutory function in <Col N="619" /> relation to fuel prices. However, the Deputy will be aware that in the recent budget in December 2000, the Minister for Finance reduced the excise duty on unleaded petrol by 2p per litre, 2.4p VAT inclusive, and on auto-diesel by 6p per litre, 7.3p VAT inclusive. With the 1% VAT reduction in January 2001, this means a cumulative tax reduction of 3p per litre for unleaded petrol and 7.8p per litre for auto-diesel.</P>
      <P>In relation to electricity, phased liberalisation of the electricity market, moving to full market liberalisation in 2005, will incentivise competition in the generation and supply of electricity. It is expected that increased competition in this sector will lead to downward pressure on price.</P>
      <P>Liberalising the Irish gas market means giving eligible customers the right to choose their own supplier, or source their own gas. While the Government has no role in the price of natural gas, giving customers the right to choose enables them to get the best deal available in the market. At the moment, this option is open to all gas fired electricity generators, regardless of size, and to customers consuming 25 million standard cubic metres per annum. I intend to lower this threshold to 2 million standard cubic metres per annum. This measure will be put into effect in a Bill which I intend to have passed by this summer.</P>
      <P>Finally, Irish business can minimise fuel costs by increasing energy efficiency. My Department's Green Paper on Sustainable Energy highlights necessary measures to promote energy efficiency among targeted consumers, such as the residential sector, industry, the services sector, the public sector and the transport and electricity sector. For example, the annual self-audit and statement of energy accounts scheme, which is managed by the Irish Energy Centre, has resulted in cumulative saving of £12 million in energy costs over the last four years. This self-audit scheme has 72 member companies with a combined energy spend of over £165 million.</P>

      <P>The external trade statistical release issued on 28 February contained revisions to the value of exports on foot of amended returns from enterprises. These arose as a consequence of the ongoing detailed investigation of the consistency of returns from enterprises to the various statistical inquiries, that is, trade, balance of payments and production.</P>
      <P>When compiling the national accounts, the various primary statistics must be integrated into a balanced set of accounts. Resolving inconsistencies between external trade and other statistical inquiries is part of this integration process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through this consistency checking, it became apparent that there was a problem with valuation of some exports. The first task was to ensure the <Col N="621" /> bottom line balance of payments-national accounts data were consistent. However, more investigation and discussion with enterprises was required to obtain the detail necessary to adjust external trade.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the recent retrospective correction to export data was based on the receipt of amended returns from some large enterprises.</P>

While it was originally envisaged that the task force would report in March of last year, the chairman of the task force requested an extension of time to facilitate a proper fulfilment of its remit, in particular the first remit which is to identify the size of the problem in Ireland and the sectors most at risk. The report of the task force is now being finalised, and will shortly be considered by the board of the Health and Safety Authority, under whose auspices the task force has been operating.

    <P>In line with IDA Ireland's strategy to achieve a more equitable distribution of inward investment, <Col N="622" /> the agency evaluates on a regular basis the industrial property requirements in regional locations.</P>
    <P>I understand that IDA Ireland's industrial property holdings in County Mayo are those listed below IDA space available leased from private developers: 22,605 sq. ft. factory in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, available at £3.22 per square foot. IDA Ireland owned space available to lease: 3,606 sq. ft. unit in Ballina available at £3.50 per square foot.</P>
    <P>In addition, I further understand that there are a number of buildings which are owned by the private sector and are available for lease in County Mayo. IDA Ireland would be involved in the promotion of these properties to suitable inward investment projects, but are not involved in the leasing arrangements with the owners. These properties are: 34,000 sq. ft. in Bunree Industrial Estate, Ballina, former Roware building; 75,000 sq. ft. in Ballina, former Henniges building; 60,000 sq. ft. in Killala, former Asahi building.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. I am aware of car insurance prices varying across different regions of the country. However, EU law prevents us, from intervening directly with the insurance companies, in the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks, that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, following publicity in recent years regarding differences in motor insurance in different areas of the country, our officials contacted a number of insurance companies to establish the reasons behind such pricing policies. The insurance companies stated that the differentials <Col N="623" /> were attributable to rising motor claims' costs and formed part of an overall review of pricing policy, in respect of selected segments of the private motor insurance business. It was also confirmed that the increases in some areas were due to an increase in commuter numbers in those areas, with consequential increases in claims frequency.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, should be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the delivery costs of subsequent claims.</P>
    <P>There are a number of such initiatives in place including, as a result of a recent Government decision, the establishment of a Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It is hoped that the work of the PIAB would, in the course of time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation. It is expected that the board will be operational early in 2002.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I re-established in 1998, is aimed at providing us, with the necessary information and advice, on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. The recent release of the board's Interim report, under the Freedom of Information Act, has provoked an interesting debate. However, it is important to note that shortly after that report had been prepared, it became apparent that the data on which it was based was questionable. The MIAB is currently proceeding with an analysis of more accurate data; and it's final report is expected by the end of this year. Upon receipt of this report and taking all other initiatives into consideration, I will then decide as to what further action is appropriate to reduce the cost of motor insurance, in this country.</P>

      <Quest> the redress a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 has in view of the fact that she left her place of employment due to alleged harassment; if she is entitled to the payment of a back week; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>In general, the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs and provide redress for employees who have been found to be unfairly dismissed. It can also be construed as dismissal if a person's conditions of work are made so difficult that he or she feels obliged to leave. This is called constructive dismissal. In general, to qual<Col N="624" /> ify for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and have at least one year's continuous service.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the details supplied in this case, that the employee concerned would not qualify for entitlements under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. However, if she feels that she has been unfairly dismissed, she may refer the matter to a Rights Commissioner under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. A rights commissioner investigation is, however, voluntary and requires the consent of both parties. Alternatively it is open to the individual to seek legal advice if she feels that her former employer is in beach of the terms of their contract of employment. This matter would of course be pursued in the civil courts.</P>
      <P>The payment of a back week is dependant on an individual's mode of payment. The Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, requires an employer to provide an employee with a written statement of certain particulars of the employee's terms of employment. This statement should include, among other things, such particulars as the rate of remuneration or method of calculating remuneration and whether remuneration is paid weekly, monthly or otherwise.</P>
      <P>In addition the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides a right of complaint to a rights commissioner for any employee who has had an unlawful deduction made from wages and this includes non-payment of wages. A complaint must be presented to a rights commissioner within six months of the non-payment which gave rise to the complaint. If the individual concerned feels that she is due wages in respect of a back week she may initiate a complaint to a rights commissioner under this Act.</P>
      <P>Detailed booklets-leaflets on individual items of legislation are available on request from the employment rights information unit of my Department. Should the individual concerned require more detailed information or further clarification on any of the matters referred to she may contact the information unit at (01) 631 3131 or on Lo-call 1890 220222 where staff will be happy to assist.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Provision of the new port access road was a condition of the planning consent given for the recently completed West Jetty extension at Foynes. Funding for the road is to be provided by the National Roads Authority, Limerick County Council and the Shannon Foynes Port Company.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that Limerick County Council was awarded £378,000 for 1999 and 2000 towards the cost of the access road to Foynes Port and that they have been allocated £150,000 under the EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme for the project for 2001. I understand that the tender process for construction of this access road has recently commenced.</P>
      <P>On 18 September 2000 the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Ports Company, the successor authorities to Foynes Harbour Trustees and Limerick Harbour Commissioners, were amalgamated to form the Shannon Foynes Port Company on foot of the Harbours Acts, 1996 and 2000 (Transfer of Functions of Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company) Order, 2000.</P>
      <P>Section 41(1) of the Harbours Act, 1996, provides for existing superannuation schemes, the establishment of pension funds and arrangements for pilots etc. in the context of the transfer from the former Limerick Harbour Commissioners to the former Shannon Estuary Ports Company, to continue in existence or force and apply to each person to whom it applied immediately before corporatisation. Similarly, section 1 of the Harbours (Amendment) Act, 2000, provides, by way of amendment of the 1996 Act, for its continued application to the new Shannon Foynes Port Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the Shannon Foynes Port Company is proceeding in accordance with their mandate provided by the statute and above men<Col N="627" /> tioned order, to ensure this important protection for the staff of the previous companies is fully respected.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am also advised that interviews for key positions within the new company are progressing according to plan. Consultations with staff and their trade union representatives have commenced regarding employee participation in a proposed voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>Fiduciary responsibility for all decisions relating to the Shannon Foynes Port Company rests with the company board since 18 September 2000. I am very grateful to the members for agreeing to serve on this vitally important board. I indicated to the House, when debating the Harbours (Amendment) Act, 2000, that there would be close liaison between the then informal implementation board and both port company boards and their successor advisory boards in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to a new single port company structure.</P>
    <P>I am advised that whereas the company board recognises that the advisory boards' members are not as involved now in the board &ndash; policy &ndash; decision making as in their previous roles, it is the board's opinion that relevant information should be and has been passed on at appropriate intervals. I am also advised that meetings of the advisory boards have taken place with updates provided on progress being made and views actively encouraged.</P>
    <P>Both advisory boards were brought together by the new company on 15 March last. The attendance included the chairperson of each advisory board, members of the company board, the new company chief executive, five members of the Foynes Port Advisory Board and nine members of the Shannon Estuary Ports Advisory Board. A full report was delivered on the up to date status and relevant progress to that meeting.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that the Shannon Foynes Port Company Board continues to encourage members of the advisory boards to seek any necessary clarification or advice, in particular through the mechanism of the quarterly advisory board meetings.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I instructed the board to locate the headquarters of the new larger company in Foynes, County Limerick. This was provided for in the Harbours Act, 1996, and 2000 (Transfer of Functions of Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company) Order, 2000, and consequently the board had no discretion in the matter. I am advised that this has necessitated the acquisition of appropriate premises for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in Iraq, including that relating to children, and the challenges of implementing the established United Nations humanitarian programmes in that country, remain of deep concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>These concerns have been actively pursued by the Government, including more recently, at high level meetings which I have had with the Russian Foreign Minister in Moscow on 21 February, the French Foreign Minister in Paris on 23 February, the new US Secretary of State in Washington on 28 February and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin on 8 March. The Government consistently advocates the rapid delivery of essential supplies under the oil for food programme. It continues to raise, within the UN and EU, the urgent need to improve the conditions of children and other vulnerable sectors of the population in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The oil for food programme was established by a memorandum of agreement between the UN and the Government of Iraq in 1996 to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people in the context of the UN economic sanctions regime introduced in 1990. This agreement came into force five years after the UN had initially offered to allow the Government of Iraq to sell oil to meet the basic needs of its people. Administered by the United Nations Office of the Iraq Programme, the oil for food programme is the existing co-ordinating mechanism for meeting the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan has recently provided a report to the UN Security Council which provides a detailed and objective analysis of the operation of the oil for food programme over the past six months and what it <Col N="629" /> means for the period ahead. The Secretary General concludes that, as long as sanctions are in place, there is no alternative to the oil for food programme in providing for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. He also restates the commitment of the United Nations in ensuring delivery of such assistance and points out that, under existing Security Council resolutions, the Government of Iraq has the necessary authorisation to export unlimited amounts of oil in exchange for the importation of a wide range of humanitarian goods. His report also confirms that the necessary funds are there for the Iraqi authorities to address urgently the nutritional requirements of children. However, the Secretary General goes on to state that, despite this, the Iraqi Government has made no application for targeted nutrition programmes for the benefit of malnourished children, pregnant women or breast-feeding mothers during the six-month period covered by his report.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the UN Secretary General's latest report, that the oil for food programme provides a ready means through which the UN and the Government of Iraq can work together to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of Iraqi children and other vulnerable sectors of the country's population. On 14 February 2001, the UN Secretary General approved a new US$5.5 billion plan submitted by Iraq for distributing UN-administered humanitarian aid in the country over a six-month period. Among the allocations within this plan is US$1.27 billion in food, US$300 million for the purchase of medicine and medical supplies and US$387 million for especially vulnerable groups. The head of UNOIP, Mr. Benon Sevan, has written to the Iraqi authorities with a view to their expediting applications for the supplies urgently required under the new plan. In particular, he has underscored the need to urgently advance the targeted nutrition programme for Iraqi children &ndash; this reflects the wishes of Ireland and other members of the international community to see the early delivery of aid to children. The Government shares the view, also expressed by the Secretary General in his report, that it is essential, now more than ever, for all parties concerned to depoliticise and facilitate the implementation of the oil for food programme.</P>
    <P>During 1999 and 2000, the Government provided a total of £596,000 in bilateral humanitarian assistance to those affected by the ongoing crisis in Iraq. Since 1997, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), has disbursed over £21 million in assistance to Iraq focusing on the most vulnerable and on basic needs, including those of malnourished children. Along with our UN and EU partners and in conjunction with the Iraqi authorities, the Government will continue to strongly support these and other practical measures aimed at ensuring more effective use of the existing UN co-ordination mechanisms and the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to <Col N="630" /> children and other vulnerable sectors of the population in Iraq.</P>

      <P>Despite recent positive signals and statements on the part of the Algerian authorities and of a number of opposition forces for the ending of the seven years of civil conflict, there is continued opposition by some groups in Algeria to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. The security situation has seriously deteriorated in recent months after an improvement following the implementation of the general amnesty announced by President Bouteflika last year.</P>
      <P>Progress in the area of human rights is a major objective in Ireland's bilateral relations with Algeria. The Government has expressed its deep concern at the horrendous loss of life and the human suffering caused by the civil conflict. We continue to take every appropriate opportunity in our bilateral contacts, through the process of dialogue between Algeria and the EU, and at the United Nations, to urge the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will lead to an ending of the conflict, and for the establishment of independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and for bringing those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>In our continuing discussions with our EU partners Ireland has sought to maintain a strong emphasis on effective action by the EU to advance full respect for human rights in Algeria. The EU has called for the establishment of a dialogue between the Government, opposition groups, and civil society, as a means to bring about the peaceful climate and the process of national reconciliation as called for by the people of Algeria in the national referendum held in September 1999.</P>
      <P>At the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland and our EU partners will again raise the situation in Algeria under agenda item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>

      <P>It was agreed at the Nice European Council last <Col N="631" /> December that a broadly based discussion on the future development of the Union should begin, leading in due course to a more detailed consideration of a number of issues, including the distribution of powers between the Union and the member states; the future status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the simplification of the treaties, and the role of national parliaments in the EU framework.</P>
      <P>While giving immediate priority to the ratification of the Nice treaty, which will involve a referendum, and the expected accompanying public debate, consideration is also being given to how Ireland's contribution to the wider debate might best be organised. Given the emphasis on ensuring that the debate is representative and broadly based, it will be important to ensure that all relevant interests have an opportunity to put forward their point of view, and we will be considering a range of options to help achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>While these developments, which are on the agenda for the Gothenburg European Council in June, have yet to be discussed in detail in the General Affairs Council, I had the opportunity to review progress in this area at my recent meeting with the German Foreign Minister, Joscka Fischer. In stressing our commitment to closer co-operation within the EU framework, I emphasised that the Government intends to participate constructively in the ongoing debate. We both looked forward to contributing to the development of the Union so that it was capable of meeting the challenges of enlargement, while remaining responsive to the needs of it's citizens.</P>

      <P>The grave situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a matter of concern to the Government in view of its potential impact on peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Ireland has participated at EU level, at the OSCE and in discussions at the United Nations Security Council about the situation in FYROM and has made its views known in these venues. In reply to a question from Deputy Stagg on 22 March, I reported on the actions already taken up to that time by the European Union and at the United Nations Security Council in relation to the situation in FYROM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in FYROM was discussed most recently at the meeting of the European Council in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March. At that meeting, the Taoiseach and I had the opportunity of hearing at first hand from President Trajkovski and Foreign Minister Kerim of the actions the <Col N="632" /> Government is taking to cope with the current crisis in the area around Tetovo. In a declaration which issued following that meeting, the full text of which is contained in the Council conclusions, the EU urged the FYROM Government to continue to respond in a restrained manner and reaffirmed our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of FYROM and the inviolability of its borders. We welcomed the determination of the elected leaders of the ethnic Albanian community to remain committed to the democratic process and their renunciation of violence and assured them that the Union will be ready to assist the necessary internal political and economic reforms in order to consolidate FYROM's multiethnic society. The EU reaffirmed its intention to sign a stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM on 9 April making FYROM the first country in the region to be linked to the EU through this new instrument.</P>
    <P>We called on the ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo to dissociate themselves from the Albanian extremists in FYROM and to condemn the violence unconditionally as the Government of Albania has already done. In this regard, I welcome the statement made this weekend by the leaders of the three main political parties in Kosovo calling on the extremist groups to lay down their weapons and return to their homes.</P>
    <P>The unambiguous condemnation of the actions of the Albanian extremists by their elected political representatives in the FYROM Government and parliament, their kinsfolk in Kosovo as well as by the Government of Albania demonstrates that they have no support. I hope that measures will now be taken by all sides to reduce tensions and restore peace in the region. When this has been achieved, the legitimate grievances of the Albanian community in FYROM must be addressed in accordance with normal democratic principles.</P>

      <P>The Government warmly welcomed the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea on 12 December 2000. The agreement brought an end to their brutal border war and provides the real prospect of a lasting peace to the war weary peoples of both countries. It is essential that its terms be fully implemented without delay. I therefore welcome the progress that has been made to date. Lasting peace and stability will enable the Governments of both countries to devote their full attention to addressing the pressing development needs facing their societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eritrea is now attempting to deal with the enormous social, economic and humanitarian con<Col N="633" /> sequences of the war. The immediate priorities include access to vulnerable populations and the safe and co-ordinated resettlement of populations who were displaced as a result of the war. Since autumn 2000, 55,000 Eritreans have returned from the Sudan. A total of 208,000 internally displaced persons are still hosted in 24 camps, while an additional 10,000 to 150,000 internally displaced persons are in host communities. Eritrea also continues to face a difficult humanitarian situation as a result of the impact of the third year of drought. So far this year, the Government has contributed £94,000 to help meet these humanitarian needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Eritrea has ratified the Geneva Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It has also signed the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. However, Eritrea has yet to sign a number of important UN human rights conventions. I urge it to do so without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 to 85, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. I have welcomed Trócaire's current Lenten campaign to highlight the issue of contemporary forms of slavery.</P>
    <P>Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights, which is currently in session in Geneva and the International Labour Organisation. The ILO will consider the issue of bonded labour at its annual conference in June 2001. In addition, the working group on contemporary forms of slavery, an intersessional working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery.</P>
    <P>Trafficking in human beings, where many of the victims are women and children, is a serious and growing problem. The EU in recent years has developed a comprehensive policy to fight against trafficking in human beings and in particular in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Since May 1999, EU activities to combat trafficking in human beings have been based on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The conclusions from the European Council in Tampere in October 1999 also give clear priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings. The European Commission has proposed a new Council framework decision concerning trafficking in persons which is currently being discussed by Ireland and our EU partners. A number of other measures have been taken at EU level which deal, to varying degrees, with the issue of trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>The sale of children continues to be of particular concern. Children are being sold for a variety of reasons, including for sexual exploitation, illegal adoption and for use as labour. Anti-slavery international estimates that there are at least 26 million slaves in the world today, a significant proportion of whom are children. The Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms the special protection and promotion the international community wishes to give to the children and his and her their rights. An important recent development was the adoption by the General Assembly in May 2000 of the optional protocol to the convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which imposes substantive general obligations on state parties to adopt all measures necessary to prevent child prostitution, child pornography, abduction, sale and traffic of children and all other forms of exploi<Col N="635" /> tation prejudicial to a child. Ireland signed the optional protocol in September 2000.</P>
    <P>There has been strong acceptance world-wide that the problems of child pornography on the Internet require close international co-operation. Such co-operation is ongoing and a variety of legal and structural measures to combat this evil are emerging, particularly at EU level. These include legal instruments for harmonising national laws on child pornography and funding support for practical initiatives such as national public hotlines and awareness measures.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a public hotline for reporting child pornography was established in Ireland in 1999 and that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, established a non-statutory Internet advisory board to supervise the hotline and to monitor overall developments in the area of the illegal and harmful use of the Internet. The board is actively involved in ensuring that all possible measures are being taken to combat child pornography from an Irish perspective.</P>
    <P>On the question of banning child pornography, the technical and legal difficulties of detection and enforcement continue to challenge law enforcement agencies world-wide. Ireland is no exception but we are particularly fortunate to have modern legislation in the form of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, which gives the Garda an effective tool, at least within our jurisdiction, to bring the perpetrators of such dreadful crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery &ndash; a most fundamental abuse of human rights &ndash; presents a challenge to all Governments. Highlighting and addressing this issue, and, in particular, the trafficking of women and children, continues to be a priority for the Government. The Department welcomes applications from organisations which believe they may qualify for consideration under the criteria governing the fund. All applications are considered by an interdepartmental advisory committee on the basis of eligibility criteria which are available to applicants and the advisory committee then makes its recommendations to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes the positive developments in Somalia since the convening of the National Peace Conference in May 2000. After ten years of violence and human suffering Somalia is now perceived to be in a period of transition following the election of a transitional national assembly <Col N="636" /> and President in August 2000. The political developments have now given a tremendous opportunity for lasting peace and reconciliation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to supporting the Somali people in their efforts to establish peace, stability and reconstruction of the institutions of governance, on the basis of a unified state with a federal system. Through our membership of the EU and the UN, we have indicated our willingness to assist in building reconciliation in Somalia. However, a massive task lies ahead in ensuring that progress is sustained and enhanced by our continued support for reconstruction, development and humanitarian programmes.</P>
      <P>Along with our partners in the European Union we are also contributing in broader terms to the rehabilitation and reconciliation processes in Somalia. The overall objective is to enhance peace and security as well as improve the social and economic status of the people of Somalia. The EU programme focuses on rural development, namely, agriculture and livestock, rural and urban water supply, primary health care, primary education, infrastructure, support for peace building, governance and civil society and de-mining. It comprises three major components, including long-term development assistance provided under the European development funds from the rehabilitation budget line and from the de-mining budget line.</P>
      <P>The third EU rehabilitation programme for Somalia will make 26.1 million available over the next three years to support these sectors. The programme will also be complemented by funding from the European Commission's food security budget line, with an allocation of 8 million. In 1999 and 2000 the EU Commission provided almost 2.5 million for human rights and democratisation projects and 16 million in humanitarian aid for Somalia. Due to the political situation in Somalia, the EU has had to make special provisions for the delivery of its assistance. Therefore, the EU programme has been channelled through non-governmental organisations and other channels to provide direct support to local communities.</P>
      <P>Following on Ireland's committed responses to previous humanitarian emergencies in Somalia, Ireland Aid provided £707,000 in emergency and rehabilitation assistance to that country last year. So far this year, Ireland Aid has provided a total of £462,000 in rehabilitation assistance. This included allocations to the Irish NGOs Concern and Trócaire for projects dealing with issues of food security and education. Further grants were made to the International Rescue Committee, which is undertaking the rehabilitation of a maternity ward and World Vision which is carrying out an agricultural rehabilitation project. Both bilaterally and in conjunction with our EU and UN partners, we will continue to support lasting peace and democratic transition in Somalia for the benefit of all its people.</P>

      <P>President Obasanjo has faced enormous challenges since coming to power as the first democratically-elected civilian President of Nigeria after 15 years of military rule. He has inherited an economy in disarray which has resulted in a standard of living lower than it was at independence. High levels of unemployment have exacerbated the poverty in which a large part of the population now find themselves. Furthermore, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course of the year 2000 has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
      <P>The Nigerian Government has taken a number of important steps to address the major problems in the economy, including in the areas of market reform, privatisation and the fight against corruption. The human rights situation in most parts of Nigeria has also improved since the new civilian Government came to power. The Government welcomes the positive initiatives taken to date and, together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, we will continue to co-operate with the elected authorities in their efforts to reduce poverty and ensure respect for human rights in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>HIV-AIDS is having a devastating impact on the poorest countries and is contributing to an increase in poverty and a decline in development indicators. In December 2000, more than 36 million people were estimated to have been infected with HIV-AIDS. More than 22 million people have died of the disease to date. HIV infection is concentrated in countries that can least afford the sickness, death and loss of productivity it brings. In Southern Africa, the HIV-AIDS infection <Col N="638" /> level in the adult population now exceeds 25% in many countries.</P>
      <P>HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in all of Ireland Aid's priority countries, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda, Mozambique and Lesotho. Ireland Aid has integrated the fight against AIDS into all of its development activities. There are now HIV-AIDS programmes in all of our priority countries and in Zimbabwe and Ghana. Our funding to UNAIDS has increased from $75,000 in 1999 to $500,000 in 2001. We will contribute £1.5 million to the international AIDS vaccine initiative in 2001.</P>
      <P>Our growing aid budget will allow us to augment international support with an increased volume of financial resources for HIV-AIDS activities at country level. These investments will be complemented by an intensified involvement in the development of health systems that are responsive to the many challenges presented by the AIDS epidemic.</P>
      <P>Most of the 36 million people who are infected with HIV cannot access effective treatment. In Africa less than one out of every 1,000 people with HIV-AIDS is benefiting from combination anti retro-viral therapy. At a cost of up to US $10,000-$15,000 per person per year, medicines to slow the progression of AIDS and to control opportunistic infections are far beyond what most African governments can afford.</P>
      <P>Last year the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, urging an accelerated EU response to the AIDS crisis and raising the issues of access to drugs for poor countries. In September 2000 the Commission issued a communication on accelerated action against HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB. It has since followed up this communication with an action plan. Accelerated action aims to increase the effectiveness of existing interventions, deals with affordability through the proposed introduction of tiered pricing and strengthens research into vaccines. The action plan gives priority to spending on health, AIDS and population, HAP, activities in the EC development co-operation programme.</P>
      <P>Following the EU-Africa Heads of State summit in Cairo in April 2000, Ireland and the European Commission drafted a plan of action, a key focus of which is to improve access by African countries to essential medications. This EU plan will now be discussed with African states in the follow-up process to the EU-Africa summit.</P>
      <P>In a statement to the UN Security Council on 19 January, we called for an intensification of efforts by UN bodies, drugs industry and other relevant organisations to address the complex issues of access to medicines and overcoming obstacles in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to use our membership of the UN Security Council to highlight this critical issue and ensure our concerns are reflected in EU policy dialogue and programme direction. We will actively participate in the forthcoming United <Col N="639" /> Nations General Assembly Special Session HIV-AIDS in New York in June of this year and at the special session on children in September. In addition, the Irish Government will strengthen its involvement in the international partnership for AIDS in Africa over the forthcoming months, and will continue to increase the volume of contributions to HIV-AIDS activities in UN agencies such as UNICEF, UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been considerable progress. A number of major pharmaceutical companies have offered to supply poor countries with key drugs at or below cost price. The EU and the US are discussing how to put in place an international system which would permit the sale of these deeply discounted drugs to poor countries in a way which would prevent them being smuggled back on to the markets of developed countries. International discussions on the establishment of one or more global funds for the purchase of the drugs for poor countries are also at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Although the provision of affordable medicines is a crucial issue, it is one element in the comprehensive strategy which is necessary to halt and reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS in poor countries. In the long-term access to universal high quality health care is essential if the spread of HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases is to be stopped. Political leaders need to recognise the gravity of the threat and take the lead in educating the public on prevention measures. National prevention strategies need to be put in place. Children orphaned by HIV-AIDS require care. Research into an AIDS vaccine has to be accelerated and properly funded.</P>
    <P>The rapid spread of HIV-AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has its roots in poverty. Intensified efforts by the international community to meet the UN target of reducing by half the number of people living in extreme poverty &ndash; defined as an income of less than $1 per day &ndash; through increases in overseas development Assistance, debt relief and the mobilisation of development finance would make a major contribution to fighting HIV-AIDS. Ireland Aid will continue to focus its programmes on the eradication of poverty and will, in the coming years, be able to allocate significantly higher resources to this objective.</P>

      <P>The promotion and support of international efforts to secure appropriate safeguards on sales and trans<Col N="640" /> fers of armaments is a key priority of Irish foreign policy. We wish to end destabilising accumulations of arms which can increase the potential for violence in areas of tension, including on the African continent. We are actively engaged on this issue in the EU context and wherever like-minded countries share this goal, particularly at the United Nations. In the run up to the United Nations conference on illicit trafficking in small arms in all its aspects, we participate actively in several fora which are setting ambitious goals for the conference.</P>
      <P>In 1998, all the European Union member states agreed to a strict code of conduct regarding the export of conventional arms. Ireland played an active role in the formulation of this code. Criterion three of the code prohibits member states from exporting goods which would provoke or prolong conflicts in the country of final destination, and criterion four specifically refers to the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the United Nations Disarmament Commission, under the chairmanship of Ireland, adopted guidelines on conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament, with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace. These highlighted the fact that the excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons, the absence of control to arrest it, and the illicit arms trade continue to have a negative effect on the internal security and socio-economic development of affected states. This is particularly the case in many African conflicts.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council is concerned, in particular, with the prevention of conflict and, therefore, the issue of the excessive or improper trade in arms is relevant in this context. Our approach, as a member of the Council, is informed by the policy that we are already following in this area. Ireland holds the chairmanship of the Angolan Sanctions Committee, and it is the responsibility of this committee to ensure that the United Nations sanctions against the UNITA rebels in Angola, which includes an arms embargo, are observed by all nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches a very high priority to the promotion of peace, stability and development in Africa. I am deeply conscious of the many ties that connect Ireland with so many parts of the continent. Generations of Irish missionaries and the invaluable work of contemporary Irish NGOs have produced a record of service and commit<Col N="641" /> ment to Africa of which all Irish people are rightly proud.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I deeply regret the enormous suffering that has been inflicted in recent years upon millions of people by the large number of conflicts on the continent. These needless wars make it immeasurably more difficult to effectively tackle Africa's development needs. Through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations, Ireland has actively sought to bring an end to conflict and promote reconciliation throughout Africa. In doing so, we have been guided by the lessons learned from our own peace process.</P>
      <P>Recent months have witnessed progress in some of the continent's most troubled regions. For several years, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been experiencing a bitter violent conflict involving several countries from the region. Until recently, prospects for an early resolution to the war were bleak. However, on 21 and 22 February, the UN Security Council met with the countries involved in the war and adopted its most important resolution to date on the conflict. Security Council Resolution 1341 sets deadlines for the disengagement of opposing forces in the DRC and urges them to adopt a timetable for the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops. I am pleased to note that Ireland played an active role in the drafting of the resolution. The disengagement of troops began on 15 March in accordance with the resolution and is being observed by members of the United Nations Mission in the DRC (MONUC). Ireland will continue to insist that all relevant Security Council resolutions are fully implemented and will encourage all the parties to the conflict to abide by the commitments made in the Lusaka agreement.</P>
      <P>I am also encouraged by developments in the Horn of Africa. On 12 December 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed an agreement bringing an end to their border war. The agreement offers the real prospect of a lasting peace to the war weary peoples of both countries. Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, has welcomed the progress made to date. We will continue to urge both Governments to fully implement the terms of the agreement without delay. We have also made known our views on developments in the peace process at the Security Council and played an important role in ensuring that the UN arms embargo on both countries was not prematurely lifted.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in the Horn of Africa, we have welcomed the encouraging signs of progress in Somalia and, along with our EU partners, have indicated our willingness to assist the process of national reconciliation and reconstruction that is required there.</P>
      <P>As a member of the IGAD international partners forum and through the EU, we have actively contributed to attempts to end the civil war in Sudan. We will continue to support progress towards a peaceful settlement of that conflict within the context of the peace initiative of the IGAD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has been appointed to chair the UN Committee on Sanctions Against UNITA. I welcome the opportunity provided by our chairmanship to contribute to building lasting peace in Angola by ensuring that all relevant UN resolutions on the conflict are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>We will continue to support UN attempts to bring an end to the war in Sierra Leone and to prevent the conflict spreading to other parts of West Africa. In this regard, we fully supported the recent Security Council decision to impose sanctions on Liberia if it does not cease its active support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</P>
    <P>The Government has also played a leading role in encouraging the international community to tackle the root causes of conflict in Africa. We have promoted attempts to end the illicit trade in small arms, to prevent the illegal sale of diamonds from conflict areas and to encourage development policies that can help prevent the outbreak of war. I firmly believe that conflict prevention must form a key component of the international community's overall policy towards Africa.</P>

      <P>The International Day Against Racism, which took place on 21 March 2001, gave Governments an opportunity to reflect on the problems posed by racism to their societies. The Taoiseach issued a statement to mark the day in which he restated the total opposition of the Government to racism and any manifestation of racism in our society. A number of events took place across the country to mark the day.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the recent establishment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of a high level steering group to implement the three-year national anti-racism-interculturalism public awareness programme. The awareness programme will receive Government funding of £4.5 million over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>With the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we are making national preparations for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, which will take place in South Africa from 31 August to 7 September 2001. We are supporting the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, in her preparations for the conference, which we hope will be a watershed in the fight against the scourges of racism and xenophobia.</P>

      <P>The UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, has given repeated assurances that it does not support China's one child policy. The UNFPA's programme in China has projects in 32 poor counties. It was requested by the Chinese Government and approved by the 36-member state UNFPA executive board. The programme adheres strictly to the voluntary, human rights based approach to reproductive health and family planning stipulated by the programme of action adopted by the UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.</P>
      <P>The abolition of quotas and targets in the 32 counties was a condition of UNFPA assistance. Funds were released only after the UNFPA field office received official written communication from provincial/local authorities that quotas and targets had been removed from participating counties. It has been agreed with the Chinese Government that the project will follow all UNFPA procedures for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Government has agreed that the project counties will be open to monitoring visits by foreigners and that county officials would be available to talk to foreign delegations.</P>
      <P>In December 1997, Ireland's ambassador to China participated in a field trip organised by UNFPA to view its programmes in China. He was completely satisfied that UNFPA was not in any way supporting China's one child policy. Following the trip, the ambassador noted that the long-term objective informing the UNFPA programme is to encourage China's family planning system to adopt a more enlightened client-driven focus by demonstrating the efficacy of a client-oriented qualitative approach operating within the counties selected by the agency.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been making voluntary contributions to UNFPA since 1993. In 2001, Ireland is contributing £1 million to the fund's core resources. Indicative commitments of £1.45 million and £2 million have been given for 2002 and 2003 respectively. It is estimated that 500,000 women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. The money provided by Ireland Aid contributes to UNFPA's efforts, saves the lives of thousands of women each year and helps prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Ireland has just completed a three year term on the executive board of UNFPA. Through its membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and be in a position to closely monitor UNFPA's performance. We assumed our position on foot of the regular rotation of donor representatives. During our tenure on the board, Ireland participated actively in policy debate concerning the present and future orientations of the agency.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a sufficient body of information available to it from this and other sources on which to form a positive assessment of UNFPA's operations. On the basis of that information, and in light of specific and repeated assurances from UNFPA, I am satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with its mandate.</P>
    <P>I am aware of allegations about the effects of China's population control policy on the human rights of the Chinese people. The Government remains very concerned about the human rights situation in China. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns, at every appropriate opportunity, to the Chinese authorities, both bilaterally and through the EU-China human rights dialogue. This dialogue is our preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation. At the General Affairs Council of 22-23 January, the EU took a number of decisions to improve the dialogue. It was decided to intensify it, focus it better and assess it on a continuous basis. The most recent session of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place on 22-23 February.</P>
    <P>On 28 February, the Chinese authorities announced their decision to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Together with my European partners, I welcomed this decision and view it as an important starting point for further improvements in the situation of economic, social and cultural rights in China.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government fully supports the enlargement process and participates positively and constructively in the accession negotiations, which are currently at a very advanced stage with Hungary and other candidate countries. At the same time, Ireland is willing to provide any assistance possible to the candidate countries in their preparations for EU membership. Ireland is perceived by these countries as having managed its membership of the EU very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> In addition to the assistance provided under EU programmes like PHARE, Ireland has provided assistance to Hungary and other candidates on a bilateral basis in the form of advice and training for officials in preparation for accession. Hungarian public servants have participated in several training courses and seminars on EU issues, which have been funded and organised by my Department in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration. This programme of courses is being developed further in the lead-up to accession, and, I fully expect that more officials from Hungary will participate.</P>
    <P>Contacts at all levels, government, parliamentary, and official, can be very beneficial to both candidate and member states alike. In respect of Hungary, I can report that such contacts have increased considerably over recent years. I would draw attention particularly to the Taoiseach's visit to Hungary in November 1999 and the President's state visit in April 2000 as just two examples of the many recent high level exchanges. Further intensive contacts are planned at all levels in the period ahead. Indeed, I look forward to welcoming the Hungarian Foreign Minister when he pays an official visit to Ireland next week.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty, clearly states that human rights figure among the principles common to all the Union's member states and on which the Union is founded.

      <P>Each member state of the EU is party to a wide range of international human rights instruments, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the core UN human rights conventions, which bind each member state to respect fundamental rights and freedoms.

      <P>According to the Strathclyde police, 373 people, including 27 from Ireland, were arrested at Faslane on 12 February and ten of those arrested, including five Irish women, were strip searched and detained in Kilmarnock police station for about five hours.</P>
      <P>At the time of these events the Irish Consulate-General in Edinburgh contacted the police to ascertain whether any Irish citizens were among those detained and was informed that all those arrested had by then been released without charge. On foot of a complaint I received a few days later from the mother of one of the women who was searched, the Consulate-General made representations to the Scottish Executive and the Strathclyde police at senior level and was assured that the matter would be fully and speedily investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Consulate-General yesterday received a response from the Strathclyde police acknowledging that the decision to subject Irish citizens to a full search was wrong and that this resulted in inappropriate procedures being adopted. In their explanation of why this mistake occurred the police assure us that the decision to carry out full searches was made before the nationalities of those arrested was known. They have apologised unreservedly for the way in which our citizens <Col N="648" /> were dealt with and have undertaken to ensure that there is no recurrence of this most regrettable incident.</P>

      <P>Details of the level of discharges of radioactive waste from the Sellafield plant and radioactivity contamination of the Irish marine environment arising from such discharges in respect of the years 1998 and 1999 are set out in the RPII's report on Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1998 and 1999 published by the RPII in September 2000. The monitoring data for the year 2000 is available on the RPII's website &ndash; www.rpii.ie. Data for the first quarter of this year will be posted on the RPII's website as soon as it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 88, it is the view of the RPII that the doses received by the Irish public through the <Col N="649" /> consumption of seafood, walking on the beaches or engaging in any other marine based activity are low and do not constitute a significant health risk. Nevertheless, the continued contamination of the marine environment from the Sellafield plant is totally unacceptable and I am continuing to exert maximum pressure on the UK authorities for the cessation of nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield and of radioactive discharges from the plant and, indeed, for the cessation of all nuclear activities at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding Waterford Airport was addressed in detail on my behalf by my colleague, Deputy Jacob, Minister for State, on the Adjournment of Tuesday, 20 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of Waterford Airport has not requested a meeting with me but I would be happy to meet with board members if they wish. I should point out, however, that the position as outlined in the House last week remains <Col N="650" /> unchanged. While my Department will continue to provide support to assist the regional airports with their marketing and promotional activities, it is not appropriate to provide direct operational subsidies to sustain airport operations.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing financial difficulties of Waterford Airport, I have made it clear that I am prepared to allocate £165,000 in marketing support this year to the airport. However, the airport authorities have indicated that they need support of the order of £500,000 this year and indeed annually in order to maintain operations. This level of assistance amounts to an ongoing operational subsidy, which, as I said, is not appropriate within Government policy of financial support for the regional airports.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the level of marketing support which I am prepared to offer to Waterford Airport this year is proportionately more than that available to the other regional airports when account is taken of the scale of operations at these airports. In both 1999 and 2000, Waterford Airport also benefited disproportionately from my Departments marketing support fund in recognition of their financial difficulties.</P>

      <P>In January this year directives issued to CIE under section 26(1) and to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann under section 19(7) of the Transport (Re-organisation of Coras Iompair Éireann) Act, 1986, regarding new notification and approval procedures in respect of proposals for the introduction of new or modified services by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>The aim of this new regulatory approach is to ensure that an operator, such as Dublin Bus, which is exempt from the requirement to hold a licence in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932, for road passenger services, does not announce or introduce services, which may serve to pre-empt the introduction of licensed services by private operators. My intention is to ensure fair treatment of new service proposals on the part of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann on the one hand and the private sector on the other.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus is complying with the directives and co-operating with my Department in respect of guidelines for the administration of the new notification system. Since the inception of the new notification system a number of proposals for new bus services in the Dublin region have been received from Dublin Bus. Those which have been approved and are in operation are as follows:</P>

    <P>As shown above, ESB power generation plant forms the bulk of the existing plant total for capacity planning purposes. To this aggregate must be added auto-producer capacity and other small scale generation plant such as that installed <i>via</i> alternative energy requirement schemes.</P>
    <P>Since the above forecast statement, the most notable additions have been the 160MW unit at Poolbeg and the 120MW peat plant at Edenderry. I understand that ESB National Grid is currently preparing an update of the forecast statement which will cover the generation capacity requirements to 2007. This is expected to be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the construction of future generating stations, the position is that prospective power producers apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary authorisations and licences in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. Details of these applications and their status can <Col N="653" /> be found on the commission's website at www.cer.ie.</P>
    <P>In the context of the above, a number of power producers have well developed plans to build new gas fired generating plants. Two such facilities are currently under construction, a 400MW plant being built by Synergen and a 340MW plant being built by Huntstown Power Company Limited. Both of these will provide significant additional tranches of generating capacity in 2002-03.</P>
    <P>In addition, the upgrading of the North/South electricity interconnector from 280MW to 400MW is proceeding according to plan and is on track for completion before the end of 2001. The 500MW Moyle interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland is expected to come on stream around the second half of 2001, adding to overall system security.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 111 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of passenger and freight handling facilities at the three State airports is a day-to-day matter for Aer Rianta. Freight facilities at the six privately owned regional airports are a matter for the relevant airport authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Dublin Airport, I am informed by Aer Rianta that the new extended passenger terminal which is currently being completed, including its baggage systems, will have a capacity to cater for 20 million passengers per annum. This compares with a passenger throughput at Dublin Airport last year of approximately 13.8 million. Aer Rianta also informs me that given the con<Col N="654" /> tinued growth in freight business, the current cargo facilities at Dublin Airport are becoming congested at peak business times. Aer Rianta is taking steps towards a more active approach to traffic management at these peak times on the landside of the airport in order to achieve a more streamlined traffic flow. In relation to longer term developments, Aer Rianta is currently involved in consultations with airport users to ensure that Dublin Airport is positioned to meet future passenger and cargo needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to freight handling capacity at the other State airports, Aer Rianta informs me that the existing cargo facilities at Cork Airport are adequate to meet current demand. For the longer term, Aer Rianta has a 40 acre site which it plans to develop for cargo and other purposes as part of its overall investment programme at Cork Airport. Current cargo facilities at Shannon are coming under pressure as a result of the strong growth in the freight sector. However, Aer Rianta's ongoing capital investment programme at Shannon is designed to ensure that future freight traffic demand will be adequately met.</P>
    <P>Freight traffic is not a major sector of activity at most of the six regional airports and I am not aware of any capacity problems for freight handling at those airports.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, £21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased to £147 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This funding will be utilised to uphold and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
      <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-06 closed on 22 September 2000. The Department received twenty-eight applications for funding under this call. These were assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants. I recently announced the successful 13 projects that will receive a total of £59 million in national development plan aid. My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals.</P>

The necessity to do this arises from competitive pressures both from the liberalisation of the market and the consolidation which is taking place in the European postal industry, driven by the four main players, the post offices of Germany, Holland, Britain and France. The investigation by An Post into the alliance possibilities is continuing and, while there are indications of interest, it is too early yet to judge the eventual outcome.

The scheme provides for the payment of a pension and a lump sum on retirement, subject to certain service criteria. In addition, by virtue of their PRSI contribution, non-military employees would be eligible for either a contributory retirement or old age pension from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The occupational pension scheme is designed to ensure that for an employee with full service &ndash;  40 years &ndash; his or her total pension benefit &ndash; social insurance pension plus occupational pension &ndash; would amount to 50% of pensionable remuneration. Moreover, if the employee concerned has dependants, his or her total benefit would be in excess of 50% of pensionable remuneration.</P>

      <P>Medical officers of the rank of captain and commandant are rostered for the provision of out of hours service to members of the Defence Forces. The incidence of duty is, on average, one duty per week. This is an incidence of rostered duties comparable to that normally required of other officers of similar rank. When the number of medical officers in any military post is insufficient to provide a continuum of 24 hour cover, local arrangements are made to engage civilian medical practitioners to provide such cover as necessary.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, recently submitted a claim on behalf of members of the Defence Forces who have been engaged in additional duties arising out of the foot and mouth disease scare and this claim is currently being processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme. By agreement with the association, discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this issue at present, other than to say that I hope for an early resolution.</P>
      <P>As a result of the distinctive nature of military duties and military life, overtime is not payable to members of the Defence Forces. However, a range of allowances are payable for the performance of particular duties which involve service significantly in excess of normal duty hours. Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a border duty allowance of £59.63 per week in the case of officers and £53.74 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates. All personnel who are engaged on border duties arising from the foot and mouth scare will be eligible to be paid border duty allowance in addition to their normal regimental pay and military service allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Military service allowance is also payable to members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in a wide range of conditions. The current rate in the case of officers is £2,502 per annum, and in the case of non-<Col N="660" /> commissioned offices and privates is £65.83 per week or £3,423 per annum. Privates with less than three years' service receive £23.70 per week. These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave and sick leave.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a substantial decline in the recorded number of farms between 1980 and 1999. However, a significant element of this decline related to a change in the CSO's methodology of determining eligible farms from 1991 onwards. Until then, all farms, irrespective of size, were included. From 1991 onwards, farms below one hectare in size were excluded. Thus, close to 30,000 farms, which were previously counted, were excluded from data from 1991 onwards.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other ways of defining full and part-time farming. In Teagasc's national farm survey, a full-time farm is defined as one which requires at least 0.75 standard labour units to operate. On this basis, Teagasc estimates that 60% of farms were part-time and 40% full-time in 1999. The figures from the 1997 survey were 58% and 42%, respectively. No comparable figures are available for 1980.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned at the decline in the numbers of full-time farms, I welcome the trend of increased participation in off-farm employment to supplement farm household incomes among smaller farmers. This trend has been helped by the buoyancy in the economy generally and the substantial number of jobs now available in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>The person named entered the scheme of early retirement from farming is in joint management with his wife. The <Col N="662" /> regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension which becomes payable to either the applicant or the spouse/ partner in such joint management arrangements.</P>
      <P>In this case both the person named and his wife are in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions, the combined value of which have been deducted from the early retirement pension. As the gross amount of early retirement pension is fixed, any increases in the rate of old age pension result in a reduction in the amount of the early retirement pension.</P>

      <P>I understand that the herd in question was collected yesterday and is being slaughtered today, 27 March 2001. An initial payment was made to the person concerned on the 2 February, 2001, and the final payment of the agreed valuation will be made on receipt of the appropriate documentation. The <i>ex-gratia </i>payment in this case will be for the period in excess of 14 days between the date of confirmation of the BSE animal and the date of the agreed valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> In the case of BSE, herd re-population is usually permitted within 30 days following satisfactory cleansing and disinfection of the farm. There is, therefore, no legislative provision for losses consequential on BSE depopulation.</P>

No area aid application was received from the person named for 2000. However, the area aid unit received a copy application and certificate of posting in February 2001 from the person named, showing that the original application was sent before the closing date of 28 April 2000. The copy of the 2000 area aid application for the person named was therefore fully accepted and processed with no outstanding errors, and the area for payment purposes has been determined at 27.20 hectares.</P>

Under the regulations governing the suckler cow premium scheme, eligibility is determined by the number of quota rights held by an applicant for the year in question. There is no record of the person named holding such a quota or having made an application for quota and consequently there is no entitlement to payment under this scheme. The person named was paid his full entitlement of £384.00 on 15 November, 2000 under the 2000 cattle headage scheme.</P>

      <P>The EU Leader+ draft operational programme was submitted by my Department to the European Commission in November last in accordance with the Commission's guidelines. Under the approval procedure, the Commission has a period of five months in which to examine the programme. My Department is in ongoing contact with the Commission as regards points of clarification which have beeen sought. The intention is to gain Commission acceptance and programme approval over the coming weeks. At the same time, final approval will be given for the Leader national rural development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of selecting local rural development groups to deliver the programmes is proceeding in parallel. The independent consultant <Col N="668" /> contracted to assess the business plans submitted by groups by way of application to be considered for delivery of the programmes is at work and will make recommendations which will be taken into account by my Department's selection committee. It is expected that the selection committee will complete its work within a short time frame. The committee will make a report to Government and the formal appointment of the appropriate number of groups and the allocation of funding will be decided by Government, having regard to the terms of the Commission's approval when received.</P>
    <P>In the meantime and so as to help bridge the gap between the conclusion of the Leader II programme and the commencement of the two new programmes which will operate in the period to 2006, I have to date allocated interim funding amounting to some £3.2 million to Leader groups without prejudice as to which groups will be appointed under the new programmes. This funding has helped to maintain core resources in the Leader II companies to facilitate the efficient and orderly conclusion of Leader II funding of projects and to ensure that groups when appointed can immediately commence appraisal and funding of sustainable new projects.</P>

      <P>An application for special beef premium in respect of seven animals was received by my Department from the person named on 24 November, 2000. Of the seven animals, only two were eligible for special beef premium based on the registered dates of birth of the animals. The application was selected for an on-farm inspection. All applications which are selected for inspection must be inspected prior to the issue of payment. In this case, the inspection has been postponed as part of the foot and mouth disease restrictions. In light of the current exceptional circumstances, my Department is considering whether there are alternative checks of an administrative nature which would be acceptable to the European Commission for releasing payments in this type of case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>I received the submission to which the Deputy refers and it is currently being examined within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation generally with regard to abattoirs is that, under EU regulations, those slaughtering more than 1,000 livestock units per annum must comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations 1997. Small abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are derogated <Col N="670" /> from certain requirements of these regulations provided they are licensed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the Abattoirs Act, 1988. These small abattoirs are, however, required to achieve minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach taken by my Department to establishments that have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the regulations. However, given that consumer protection must be our absolute priority, my Department has no option but to refuse to license those premises which are not prepared to achieve the minimum standard required.</P>
    <P>On the question of financial aid, abattoirs fall within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector. One such provision stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises that comply with existing minimum standards. Therefore, while it is not possible nor would it be appropriate to provide funding to achieve minimum hygiene standards, possibilities do exist for financial aid in circumstances which involve rationalisation, research and development, human resources, training and so on and the ACBI was invited to submit proposals for financial assistance in line with these criteria.</P>
    <P>Traceability is a vital factor in maintaining consumer confidence in the safety of our meat. With regard to beef and beef products, I am satisfied that excellent traceability is achieved through my Department's CMMS database which ensures that only animals whose origin and identification can be clearly vouched for are allowed into the food chain. Furthermore, EU regulations on compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to the final point of sale were introduced last September. These measures offer consumers both here and abroad traceability guarantees regarding Irish beef.</P>
    <P>It has been my policy to extend the traceability system to include the sheep sector. While there has been reluctance within the sector to this, recent events have highlighted the need for it and it is my intention to have a system in place in the very near future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that early retirement scheme applicants cannot finalise and submit their applications due to the current restrictions on the sale and movement of livestock due to the foot and mouth situation, which necessitate them holding onto their remaining livestock; if any exceptions can be made for such applications, who, if the current restrictions were not in place, would have divested all their stock and proceeded to apply under the early retire ment scheme; and if he has any proposals to allow force majeure relief in such circumstances, particularly where all other conditions of the early retirement scheme have been complied with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. However, compensation at current market value is paid in respect of herds that are destroyed under the arrangements in place to deal with BSE. The cost of compensation to farmers from 1990 to 2000 was £48.5 million. This includes the compensation for depopulated herds, birth cohort/progeny animals and UK imported animals. In addition, expenditure of approximately £10.7 million has been incurred on BSE associated costs including haulage, factory slaughter, rendering and disposal. To date, £23.9 million has been recouped from the EU under Ireland's BSE eradication plan.</P>

      <P>Under current EU legislation member states are obliged to put in place national identification systems that identify at least the holding of birth and of dispatch holding of sheep. The national sheep identification system to be implemented in Ireland, which will identify all sheep on an individual basis, more than meets the provisions of the relevant EU legislation, both current and projected, and will be of significant benefit in terms of disease control, marketing and implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum which reported in October, 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the national identification scheme farmers will be able to choose from a range of different tag types. Full information on the available tags, tag suppliers etc. will be posted to all farmers before the commencement of the scheme. In addition, Teagasc will have an advisory role in promoting best tagging practice and intends to hold open demonstration days for farmers at various locations, the disease situation permitting.

However, the advice that people should not travel from rural areas of the UK, and that events likely to attract people in high risk categories &ndash; farmers, vets and others involved in the agri-business industry &ndash; should not proceed, remains.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the measures in place are intended to prevent the longer term and more damaging impact that the uncontrolled spread of foot and mouth disease would undoubtedly have on the tourism sector and other sectors.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 137 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on his herd on 23 October 2000, 11 animals which were not present at inspection were deemed not to have been in his herd at the date of application. The person named was informed in writing on the day of inspection that the missing animals were rejected for grants, and that the likely penalty would be the loss of all 2000 cattle headage <Col N="674" /> grants. He was given the opportunity to explain in writing within seven days why the 11 animals were absent. However, no satisfactory explanation was provided.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 13 November 2000 advising him that the 11 absent animals were rejected from his claim, and that as it had been found a false declaration had been made through serious negligence, no grants would be paid to him under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. No reply was received directly from him, but representations dated 15 December 2000 were received on his behalf. These are being considered at present, and a reply will issue shortly.</P>

      <Col N="675" /> When a person enters the scheme of early retirement, my Department contracts with that person to pay the pension for as long as he/she remains eligible under the scheme.

Transferees must also comply with their undertakings under the scheme for the same period.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if the person named withdraws from the scheme within that period, the contract is broken, and she will have to repay all moneys paid to her since her entry to the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named has not farmed since 1982. He wrote to my Department inquiring about his eligibility under the new scheme of early retirement from farming. The position, as outlined by him, was that he had ceased farming in 1982 due to an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis and since then had leased his land and engaged in a business outside of farming.</P>
      <P>The conditions for eligibility under the early retirement ERS2 2000 scheme specify that the applicant must have farmed for the ten calendar years prior to the signing of the transfer-lease documents and must, at the same time, derive not less than 25% of his or her income from farming. These conditions could not be met by the person named as he had ceased farming in 1982.</P>
      <P>While provision is made under the scheme for the waiving of certain conditions under <i>force majeure</i>, my Department considered that the circumstances in this case, where the person named had not farmed for nearly 20 years, were such that he could not reasonably be considered eligible.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Killorglin, County Kerry was included in the list of small towns which had areas designated under the town renewal scheme announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government last July. Incentives to encourage the residential element of the scheme were available from that time and agreement has now been reached with the European Commission to allow the application of commercial and industrial incentives to the majority of projects planned under the business element of the scheme. Details of the new arrangements, which are tailored to meet the Commission's requirements on State aids, were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 March last.</P>
      <P>Incentives will be available to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that is enterprises defined by the EU as having certain characteristics, including a staff of fewer than 250 employees, with either an annual turnover not exceeding 40 million euro or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 27 million euro. In detail, the range of projects that have been cleared to proceed from 6 April 2001 following discussions with the European Commission are all new build SME projects &ndash; such projects will be eligible for both commercial and industrial incentives; refurbishment projects in the following categories: SME projects where the expenditure incurred is below 800,000 euro &ndash; £630,051 &ndash; will qualify for the full range of commercial and industrial incentives; SME projects which involve both expenditure on refurbishment and the provision of an extension where the cost of the extension is at least 25% of the market value of the existing building &ndash; this category will also qualify for commercial and industrial incentives; local retail SME projects, excluding mail order and financial services. Incentives for office and industrial development are therefore excluded under this category.</P>
      <P>Projects which qualify under any of the three refurbishment categories outlined above will be eligible under the scheme. Refurbishment projects which do not fall within these categories are the subject of ongoing discussions with the EU Commission. In view of the delay in reaching agreement with the Commission on the commencement of the commercial and industrial element of the scheme, the termination date of the scheme has been extended from 31 March 2003 to 31 December 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision to allow the implementation of these arrangements was included on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001. The provision also pro<Col N="682" /> vided that capital allowances will not apply in respect of expenditure incurred, on or after 6 April 2001, on industrial and commercial premises in designated areas under this scheme where any part of that expenditure is met by way of grant assistance from State bodies or elsewhere. This amendment is being made in order to ensure that the scheme complies with the European Commission's regional aid guidelines for the period to 2006 and similar amendments were made on Committee Stage in respect of the urban and rural renewal schemes.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider amending tax laws in order that members of the public service or of the Garda Síochána who take up posts abroad, particularly where they are contributing to Ireland's obligations under United Nations membership, should be able to avail of the tax arrangements that apply to private sector workers working overseas, whereby after a certain number of days abroad they are no longer taxable in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr McCreevy Mr McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 823 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief by way of a deduction against earnings in the case of certain Irish resident employees who work overseas, other than in the UK, during a tax year. The relief does not apply to employees paid out of the public revenue of the State, for example, civil and public servants, military personnel or employees of any State board or bodies. Thus, to qualify, a person must work abroad for at least 90 days in a tax year or in a relevant period. A relevant period is a continuous period of 12 months straddling two tax years. However, no one day can form part of two relevant periods. Each period of absence must include a continuous period of at least 11 consecutive days referred to in law as qualifying days. The amount of the deduction is related to the time spent on a foreign employment but there is an overall cap of £25,000 on the amount of the deduction which may be availed of by the individual in any one tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to employees of a public body, however, where such employees are seconded to a subsidiary of that body they will qualify for the foreign earnings deduction in respect of that employment. It is not necessary that the employees be transferred to the payroll of the subsidiary, provided they are seconded to the subsidiary and their salary is recharged to the subsidiary. They can therefore remain in the pen<Col N="684" /> sion scheme, etc. of the public body which will recharge the costs of these employees to the subsidiary. In calculating the foreign earnings deduction the employment income includes income from the public body prior to the secondment but days abroad prior to the secondment are ignored.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to make any amendments to the legislation as proposed by the Deputy. However, I should point out that this relief has had to be amended in the last two Finance Bills and the current Finance Bill to combat abuses and a termination date of 2003 has now been introduced to enable the relief to be reviewed.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will arrange for a free telephone facility to be operated by the Revenue Commissioners in view of the enormous confusion among members of the public with the new format of the tax free allowance certificate.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are making every effort to explain the changes in the tax system to PAYE taxpayers and to employers.</P>
      <P>The completion of the tax credits system represents a significant change and initially some members of the public may well experience some difficulty in coming to grips with the new arrangements. However, I have no doubt that once the public gets used to the system they will recognise it as a major improvement.</P>
      <P>Each year at this time, the Revenue Commissioners issue notices of entitlements to every employee in the country. This year over two million notices were issued. Although full details are not available, Revenue report that the volume of business in PAYE tax offices is running at roughly last year's levels. Direct contacts with taxpayers in tax offices or on the phone are taking up slightly more time than last year. This is to be expected but there is some evidence that the postal queries are slightly down in number.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have produced a detailed explanatory leaflet for employees, which contains a considerable amount of information to explain the changes in the system. This leaflet was sent to each employee or assessable spouse, in the case of jointly assessed couples. Employees seeking to understand the changes will undoubtedly need to take some time to read the leaflet carefully and they can contact their local PAYE tax office if they have queries.  </P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also produced a video and CD-ROM explaining the changes necessary in payroll systems. They have issued this and supporting documentation to all employers to ensure that they deduct the correct tax from employees from 6 April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, at this time of year, all tax offices assign the maximum possible number of staff to <Col N="685" /> answering telephone calls-personal callers' inquiries regarding PAYE. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they plan to introduce a general 1890 number &ndash; local rate &ndash; for all PAYE employee inquiries. These plans are at an advanced stage, but it was not possible to introduce them in time for this year's PAYE bulk issue of notices of tax credits.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I consider that the Revenue Commissioners are doing everything possible to ensure that taxpayers' queries on this matter are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner.</P>

      <P>It is the Office of Public Works policy to issue to each State &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; employee a contract of employment detailing the main terms and conditions of that employment. There are currently five types of employment contracts in use by the Office of Public Works. These are full-time contract, temporary-fixed term contract, specified purpose contract, part-time contract and apprenticeships. All employees should have a contract of employment suited to their position.</P>
      <P>The rates of pay and subsistence are those set down by the Department of Finance for those employees represented at the joint industrial council for State industrial employees. These rates are readily available to all employees and cover many Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A handbook for &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; employees was produced in 1999 and is available to all employees detailing the various entitlements available, including payment of wages, pensions, leave allowance, safety, health and welfare.

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in Statutory Instrument No 353, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme is under review by an interdepartmental committee under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria. There was no definite date for the completion of this review. I understand the work of the committee is ongoing. It would be imprudent of me to consider any amendments to the scheme until such time as the review is completed and its content is given due consideration. For the Deputy's information, the blind car owners and users association was one of the groups who made an oral submission to the committee.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the new Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was approved by the European Commission on 22 March. The programme was signed in Belfast by the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Michel Barnier. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy D. Ahern, represented the Government at the signing of the programme. The next phase of the programme's development involves the production of the programme complement. The programme complement sets out a range of implementation issues, including the method for delivery of funds, detailed measure descriptions, and project selection criteria. This phase of development must be completed within three months of the Commission's approval of the programme. My expectation is that elements of the peace programme will be launched in early summer.</P>
      <P>Last October I put in place a £2 million funding package to enable community based projects to continue in operation until the new programme comes on stream. My understanding is that the initiative has been widely welcomed and is meeting all immediate needs. Similar arrangements have been put in place in Northern Ireland in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA Programme, the programme was lodged with the European Commission last November following approval of the proposals by myself and the Minister for Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, Mr Mark Durkan, MLA, at a meeting in the North South Ministerial Council. The Commission raised a number of technical matters with the authorities North and South earlier this year and these have been resolved to the Commission's satisfaction. I am currently awaiting a formal response from the Commission on the programme.</P>
      <P>Authorities North and South working under the aegis of the special EU programmes body will need to consider the Commission's response before detailed negotiations are undertaken with the Commission. Both Administrations are anxious that these negotiations be completed quickly. In a similar manner to the peace programme, detailed implementation procedures will be contained in the programme complement and this phase of development can be completed only once the programme is agreed. I am hopeful that the INTERREG programme will be available from late summer.</P>
      <P>Similar timeframes will apply to the delivery of the Ireland-Wales, Atlantic Area, North West Europe and Inter-regional INTERREG programmes.</P>

      <P>Vehicle registration tax, VRT, is payable on the first registration of a vehicle in the State and applies to both new and second-hand vehicles, including jeeps. The current Finance Bill is amending the definition of category B vehicles. The rate of VRT for category B vehicles is 13.3% of the open market selling price. Jeep-derived vans and similar vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight below 2,520 kilograms or a wheel base below 2.450 metres will be classified as category B. Jeep-derived vans and similar vehicles exceeding both of these thresholds will be classified as category C vehicles. A flat rate of £40 VRT applies to this category. Once the Finance Bill is passed, the relevant amendment will have effect from a date to be specified by ministerial order. I have no further plans to amend the legislation in relation to vehicle registration tax.</P>

      <P>The correspondence in question relates to the classification of commercial vehicles for vehicle registration tax, VRT, purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992 Finance Act defines a category B vehicle as a vehicle, other than a category A vehicle, a motor-cycle or a listed vehicle, which is of not more than three tonnes unladen weight and which has a roofed area to the rear of the driver's seat, the floor of which is less than two metres in length when measured in such manner as may be approved by the Revenue Commissioners. The rate of VRT for a category B vehicle is 13.3% of the open market selling price, OMSP, of the vehicle. A category C vehicle means a vehicle other than a category A vehicle, a category B vehicle or a motor-cycle &ndash; Finance <Col N="689" /> Act, 1992. The rate of VRT for a category C vehicle is a flat rate of £40.</P>
    <P>There have been disputes over the categorisation of various models into category B/category C since 1992. It is the desire to qualify as a £40 vehicle for tax purposes that is at the root of the problem. It was brought to my attention that the legislation as it stands in this regard may be giving rise to inconsistencies. The issue has been examined at length by the Revenue Commissioners. I also understand that Revenue have had a number of meetings with the motor trade regarding the classification of commercial vehicles for VRT purposes. Arising from this process, an amendment to the existing VRT legislation is included in the Finance Bill amending the definition of category B vehicles. Car-derived vans, jeep-derived vans and similar vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight below 2,520 kilograms or a wheel base below 2.450 metres will be classified as category B. Car-derived vans, jeep-derived vans and similar vehicles exceeding both of these thresholds will be classified as category C vehicles. Once the Finance Bill is passed, the relevant amendment will have effect from a date to be specified by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The figures for the numbers of new vehicles registered in categories B and C for the years 1993 to 2000 are set out below:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes received a request from the taxpayer for a certificate of tax-free allowances on 9 March 2001. The inspector wrote to the taxpayer on 16 March 2001 requesting details of the taxpayer's earnings during the period from 6 April 2000, that is, the beginning of the current tax year, to 29 January 2001 when he took up his current employment.

    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> On 21 March 2001 the inspector issued a certificate of tax-free allowances for the taxpayer. The certificate was issued on a week-one basis, that is, effective from the date of issue only, because the inspector does not have sufficient information about the taxpayer's earnings in the current tax year to determine what his current tax-free allowances should be. When the inspector receives the information requested in his letter of 16 March 2001, he will review the taxpayer's tax-free allowances and make any necessary amendments.</P>

In this regard, expressions of interest were received by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited from <Col N="691" /> interested parties on 8 January 2001 and on the basis of these expressions of interest a number of proponents have been selected from which outline bids will be sought shortly. Until these bids have been received and assessed it will not be possible to quantify the cost of different elements of the project.

      <P>The estimated cost of relocating the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories and the State Laboratory from Abbotstown to Backweston is £157 million. The cost reflects the necessity to provide modern state-of-the-art facilities which would be of a standard comparable to the best laboratory facilities in the EU, US, etc. and would be capable of achieving international acceptance and accreditation. The laboratories concerned are to the forefront in the battle to ensure food safety and to allay consumers' fears on food quality and standards. The relocation of the Marine Institute to Galway is estimated to cost £31 million. Both estimates of cost include construction costs, design team fees, VAT, inflation etc. Planning permission has been sought for the relocation of the laboratories to Backweston.

The needs of those with disability are being met in more flexible ways. A database of persons with intellectual disability has been established and one for those with physical and sensory disability is being developed. These provide the basis for planning for health and personal social services. In addition, a working group is examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment and the training of those with disability has been restructured. Resources devoted to services for persons with disability have been greatly increased in recent years and, for example, additional spending in the health area alone will amount to over £310 million in the lifetime of the present Government up to the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government on whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the matter and reply directly.</P>

      <P>The representation to the Deputy would appear to relate to treatment received at a public hospital. If the Deputy could forward more precise details to me in this case, I will be pleased to have the matter examined by the relevant health agency.</P>
      <P>On the wider question of nursing recruitment, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a number of initiatives have been taken at national level and in the greater Dublin area in particular to attract nurses back to work. Indications are that the nurse staffing situation is improving as a result and as the recruitment of nurses from abroad begins to pay dividends. Beaumont Hospital, for example, now has a full complement of nurses &ndash; at one stage last year it had 130 nursing vacancies. Over 900 nurses from non-EU countries have been granted work visas or work authorisations since June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular, a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February. As part of my overall recruitment/retention strategy, I have introduced financial support for <Col N="694" /> nurses and midwives undertaking a wide range of post-registration educational courses, including the payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>I have also substantially increased the number of nursing training places. An additional 300 places were created last year, bringing to 1,500 the number of training places nationally. To increase the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme this autumn with an annual intake of 40 students. A total of 1,540 places will thus be available this year. The recruitment/retention initiatives for qualified nurses are impacting positively on the nursing vacancy situation. In time, the large increase in the number of nursing students being trained will greatly improve the supply of nurses for our health services.</P>

The report is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to redressing the geographic imbalance which has evolved over many years in our health services and the developments currently taking place under the national development plan at numerous hospitals in each health board area reflect this commitment. Furthermore, my Department is currently engaged in a major review of hospital bed capacity and this, when completed, will not only indicate total future bed requirements but will also indicate regional needs in this regard. While I acknowledge that many of our national specialties are located in the Dublin region, and this can be well justified in the interests of patients and quality of service, I should emphasise that current health policy lays great emphasis on equity of access, including geographic access.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance, mobility allowance and motorised transport grant are administered by the health boards on my behalf. The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is paid in respect of eligible children under 16 years of age who have such a severe physical or intellectual disability that they require care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. The current maximum rate of DCA is £117.30 per month and is increasing to £129.40 per month from 1 April 2001. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: the disability must be present at the time of the application and be likely to continue to last for at least a year; the disability must be so severe that the child requires from another person constant care or supervision, that is, continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age and the constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by arrangement by them with another person or persons.</P>
      <P>Only the means of the child are taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance; the means of the parents are not considered. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; in this context include payments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained. Where there is more than one eligible child in a family, a full DCA payment is made in respect of each child.</P>
      <P>From 1 April 2001 the following amendments to the domiciliary care allowance scheme come into effect: the abolition of the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, requirement that the handicap must have been present for six months prior to the date of application. From 1 April 2001 children may become eligible for DCA from birth. Therefore, from that date payment of the allowance should be made from the date of application. The second amendment is the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>DCA payment in respect of periods spent at home, for example, weekends and holidays, by eligible children who normally reside in special schools or institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The current maximum rate of the allowance is £45.60 per month and is being increased up to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001. It had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers, tax concessions, scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility <Col N="698" /> allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have given further consideration to this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals. It has now been decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax concessions, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing maximum rate of £45.60 per month. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: they must be over 16 years and under 66 years; living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. In assessing means, any income in excess of the current disability allowance rate is regarded as means. For those people on disability allowance, invalidity pension or infectious diseases maintenance allowance, income earned up to a maximum of £75 per week of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature can be disregarded for the purpose of assessing mobility allowance.</P>
    <P>The motorised transport grant is a means tested health board payment. The purpose of this allowance is to provide assistance to disabled persons who may need a car to obtain/retain employment and/or to provide assistance to disabled persons who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the disabled person to obtain/retain employment or have transport requirement because of isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in the cases of persons with severe disabilities who are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from work. Consideration might be given for the purpose of the scheme to award a grant for the purchase of a car in the name of the person with the disability subject to the understanding that he or she will be driven by another person, whose name will be notified to the health <Col N="699" /> board, to and from his or her place of employment.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment depends on the claimant's means. Assessment is carried out by the community welfare officer and is based on the income of the applicant and applicant's spouse, if any, together with any income derived from assets, investments, lettings, etc. This is reduced by the following outgoings: allowances for rent, mortgage interest repayments, ground rent or exceptional needs or expenses in excess of the prescribed amount; allowances as permissible under the income tax code. If an applicant and-or spouse has assets, apart from their basic income and the family home, that yield an interest payment that is more than or equal to the lowest consecutive motorised transport grant currently available, such an applicant would not be eligible for a motorised transport grant on means grounds.</P>
    <P>A grant of up to 75% of the cost of motorised transport may be paid, subject to the maximum grant. Subject to this limitation, the amount in each case will be determined by reference to a scale of payments related to various income levels, the amount of which will be fixed by the chief executive officer of the health board and revised from time to time. When a grant has previously been paid towards the purchase of a new vehicle, a grant towards replacement of the car will not normally be payable until three years from the date that the previous grant had been paid. When a previous grant was for the purchase of a used car, regard shall be had to the age and value of the applicant's existing car and to the age and type of the car the applicant proposes to purchase. The maximum motorised transport grant is currently £3,171 and is being increased to £3,300 from 1 April 2001.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health services are available to all persons ordinarily resident in this country who contracted hepatitis C, regardless of the source. Depending on the person's financial circumstances, all such persons have either full eligibility, that is, medical card holders, or limited eligibility for health services. Statutory responsibility for the provision of health services rests with the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has contacted me recently regarding a person who contracted hepatitis C while abroad. As a result, I understand that an officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority has contacted the Deputy directly with a view to discussing the availability of services to the individual in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, persons who contracted hepatitis C through the administration within <Col N="704" /> the State of infected blood or blood products are entitled to a range of health care and support services as well as financial compensation. These services are made available because of the particular circumstances surrounding the use of contaminated anti-D product within the State, and the consequent effects on the national blood supply. The relevant legislation is the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 and the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997 which cover &ldquo;persons who . . . contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immunoglobulin Anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or blood transfusion . . .&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The circumstances regarding the anti-D contamination in this country do not apply to persons who contracted hepatitis C abroad and accordingly they are not encompassed by the legislation referred to above.</P>
    <P>On two occasions, compensation has been paid by the State to persons who were referred to the UK for treatment and contracted hepatitis C during that treatment. Both patients were referred abroad under the aegis of a health board as the services they required were not available here at the time. I am prepared to consider similar further cases should they arise.</P>
    <P>Tests for hepatitis C were first introduced in 1991. Before that date, receipt of a blood transfusion is universally recognised to be one of the risk factors for acquiring this disease, and does not necessarily indicate any negligence or liability on the part of the relevant health authorities. However, it is open to any person who considers that they may have issues to be pursued in this regard to consult their legal advisers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 205, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck's recent advertising campaign has been very successful and the uptake of invitations to screening is now approaching the target level of at least 70%, which BreastCheck hopes to exceed. The cumulative uptake since the start of the programme is 67% and BreastCheck has informed me that this figure is likely to increase by several percentage points when the second invitations for women who did not attend are issued in all areas screened.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck is strongly committed to reaching all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years as quickly as the campaign allows. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Special legislation was passed allowing BreastCheck to collate a register of eligible women and screening will be offered to well women, who have no symptoms, in a systematic way so that all eligible women can be screened routinely every two years. If a woman has symptoms she should consult her general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial stages low volumes of women were screened in order to ensure that the quality of the programme was optimised at every step. BreastCheck offers screening to women in the target age group by invitation only and is there<Col N="706" /> fore not a demand service Women in the target age group will be automatically invited for screening on an area by area basis, in a fair and equitable manner covering each of the health board areas in phase one. To date BreastCheck has invited over 30,000 women for screening.</P>

      <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. The aims of the review process are to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this review is to address the following issues: the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being met; the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme; the need and the likely future demand for private nursing home care; the supply of nursing home care in the future; the role of the nursing home sector in an integrated public-private care system; the role of the social economy in an integrated, community-based, long-stay care system; optimal funding arrangements for long-stay care; the major policy questions for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Eamon O'Shea, National University of Ireland, Galway, was engaged to carry out the <Col N="709" /> detailed research and preparation of a report. The review was overseen by a steering committee comprising officials of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. I understand that Professor O'Shea consulted with various interested parties including officials from the health boards and owners of private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children intends to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

These relate to the additional capital and revenue funding required to support the programme and the basis on which nurse teachers will transfer to the higher education sector.</P>
      <P>The funding issues are currently being considered by an interdepartmental steering committee which has been established in response to a recommendation of the nursing education forum.

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of the Minister for Health and Children to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one-fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>

    <P>However, as the Deputy will appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving,<i> inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer <Col N="712" /> assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority. The criteria for this scheme are set out in the Department of the Environment and Local Government's Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>The housing modifications or adaptations required vary according to the level of disability involved in each particular case. It is, therefore, necessary for a trained professional, namely an occupational therapist, to identify the most suitable modifications which will allow the individual to function adequately within the home. Without these modifications, some everyday functions may be difficult or impossible to carry out due to the nature of the particular disability. Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board, in order for the grant to be approved.</P>
      <P>Occupational therapists generally carry out these assessments in the order in which they are referred from the local authority. However, I understand that in more urgent cases, certain assessments will be given priority as directed by the local authority.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 upwards, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are independent bodies, democratically elected and accountable to their local electorate. As part of the ongoing programme of local government renewal, the Government is promoting a strengthened local government system which is democratically based and working in partnership with the community it serves, in line with the constitutional recognition of local government adopted by the people in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of a more accountable local government system is a key objective of the renewal programme. Measures to achieve this objective include the introduction of strategic policy committees to enhance the policy making role of the elected member and to develop community and sectoral participation in local policy making; the establishment of broadly representative and inclusive county city development boards led by local government, which will, <i> inter alia</i>, give the community and the local social partners a role in bringing about the more coherent deliv<Col N="715" /> ery of public sector and local development services at local level; an efficiency agenda involving the development of modern financial management and accounting systems to provide simplified, transparent and comparable data; value for money and new audit initiatives; the development of customer action plans; new corporate plans in local authorities to improve local authority strategic management and operations; an initiatives fund of £15 million to support innovation and best practice; modernisation of human resources policies and introduction of performance management; a new emphasis on area committees and delivery of services at local level and the application of the Freedom of Information Act to local authorities from October 1998.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill currently before the House includes statutory provisions to underpin initiatives already under way. In addition, it makes provision for further measures to make local government more accountable. These include a new ethics framework for elected members and staff; strengthened rights of access to local authority meetings; proposals for directly elected mayors-chairs in cities and counties, who are accountable to the council and to the community; proposals for a salary type payment to councillors to enable them to carry out their policy making role and ensure accountability; and the abolition of the dual mandate will also result in a greater focus on local authority matters by local authority members.</P>

A notice under this section may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Under the Roads Act, 1993, landowners and occupiers of land can be required by the local authority to cut back trees, hedges and other vegetation to remove or prevent any danger to those using or working on a public road. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the authority can act at once to remove or reduce the danger. Where a dispute arises between neighbours as to the height of a particular hedge on a person's private property, this is a matter to be resolved between the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>A survey of local authorities, carried out by my Department last year, indicated that some 44,000 individual fixed rate local authority housing loans were outstanding and that the average amount outstanding on individual loans was less than £5,200.</P>
      <P>Borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a very significant concession, the cost of which must be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities. Borrowers with building society/bank fixed rate mortgages on the other hand are obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months' interest or more in the event of early redemption.</P>
      <P>In the past five years, the amount outstanding to the local loans fund and the Housing Finance Agency in fixed interest rate loans has reduced significantly, from £509 million to £135.6 million, indicating that many borrowers have availed of this concession.</P>

      <P>A review is under way in my Department as to what waters may need to be designated as sensitive areas for the purposes of the urban waste water treatment directive in addition to the ten areas already designated by the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994. The need for designation of the Cork harbour area is being considered in the context of this review. The effect of designation of a water body as a sensitive area is generally to require a higher level of treatment of discharges of waste waters from the larger agglomerations into that body of water. The treatment to be provided is determined by reference to the particular <Col N="717" /> circumstances, for example, removal of phosphorus and/or nitrogen.</P>
      <P>To assist the review, the Environmental Protection Agency is, at the request of my Department, carrying out an assessment of the trophic status of estuarine and coastal waters and I understand that the assessment is likely to be finalised by the agency and made available to my Department shortly. I hope to be in a position shortly thereafter, therefore, to make a decision as to the need to designate all or part of the Cork harbour area as a sensitive area.</P>
      <P>The Cork main drainage scheme, costing more than £200 million, is due for completion in 2003. Provision has been made in its design to facilitate the installation of nutrient reduction facilities on a modular basis should this become necessary. Appropriate provisions have been incorporated into the tender documents to allow for the retrofitting and operation of such facilities.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has recently indicated its view that most member states should designate a wider range of waters as sensitive waters. My Department has already advised the Commission of the review now under way and of our intention to designate a further seven freshwater bodies as sensitive areas. We have also advised that designation of the position in relation to estuaries and coastal waters will be finished following consideration of the imminent EPA assessment of the trophic status of such waters.</P>

The scheme was tenth on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000 to 2002 announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>While section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, provides power to make regulations, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, requiring works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise, this issue is dealt with on a case by case basis through environmental impact assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made on a wide range of grounds to proposed road developments, including the impact of increased noise, and objectors may raise their concerns at a public inquiry. The approval process for road projects, operated by An Bord Pleanála, can require modifications to be made to the scheme in relation, <Col N="719" /><i>inter alia</i>, to noise mitigation, and such modifications have been imposed as required.</P>
    <P>Given the above approach, regulations have not been made under section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, in relation to noise mitigation on newly constructed roads nor are such regulations at present proposed. Section 77 does not provide for the payment of compensation to affected parties.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to housing provided by voluntary housing bodies such as Respond! with funding from my Department's voluntary housing rental subsidy and capital assistance schemes. There is, advisedly, no provision in the voluntary housing schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants. A tenant purchase scheme is not desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector in this country as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
      <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner-occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits: special mortgage allowance of £9,000 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites scheme, and exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 to 237, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The disabled persons' grant scheme is administered by the local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act.</P>
      <P>The statutory regulations do not contain a strict definition of disability for the purposes of the disabled persons' grant scheme. This provides a measure of flexibility to local authorities in dealing with individual applications under the scheme. It is a matter for authorities to decide on the general criteria which they will apply and review them on a case by case basis, if necessary, exercising appropriate flexibility and compassion.</P>
      <P>I have improved the terms and conditions of this scheme on three occasions since 1997 with the effective maximum grant now £16,000, double what it was in 1997. In the case of a private house, the grant may now cover 90% of the approved cost of the work while the full cost of the works are covered in the case of a local authority house. These significant improvements have resulted in a much higher level of activity under the scheme. In 2000, £21.8 million was paid by local authorities in respect of 3,650 disabled persons grants compared to £8.6 million in respect of 2,231 grants in 1997. No data is available in my Department regarding the number of grant applications refused.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 252 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>Some 8,800 persons receiving old age non-contributory pension and some 1,550 persons receiving widow's non-contributory pension from my Department are also receiving British pensions. Records are not maintained in respect of people receiving contributory pensions as contributory pension are not means-tested and are not, therefore, subject to review or affected by changes in pensions from other jurisdictions. The value of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; pension is recorded on individual claim files and it is not practicable to establish the aggregate value of the British pensions in payment in these cases.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to old age non-contributory and widow's non-contributory pensions account must be taken of all income. This includes income from other pensions, whether Irish or foreign. This is the nature of non-contributory pension schemes. Ongoing entitlement to these payments is also conditional on the continuing fulfilment of the means conditions and pensioners are required to notify my Department of any change in their circumstances which might affect their entitlements. As part of its overall programme of claim maintenance and review my Department conducts periodic reviews to ensure that people on means-tested pensions receive payment according to their needs. Many of these reviews are requested by pensioners themselves. If their means from other sources decline, their pensions will be increased and if their means from other sources increase, their pensions will be reduced.</P>
      <P>Of some 14,400 old age non-contributory pension cases recently reviewed some 1,300 are due to have their pensions reduced as a result of unnotified increases in British pensions. In the case of widow(er)'s non-contributory pension, some 150 cases in receipt of a British pension have experienced a similar reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> In the case of Irish pensioners with a British retirement pension, it is the practice, when entitlements are being reviewed, to use the sterling to euro rate of exchange at the date of the last increase in British pension or the rate of exchange in the subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner.</P>
    <P>To change the present arrangements whereby account is taken of British pension in determining entitlement to non-contributory pensions here, would require a change in the legislation underlying the scheme. Any such change would have to apply to pensioners generally with other income and would have substantial financial implications. I have made substantial improvements in the means test for non-contributory pensions, most recently, in relation to the assessment of capital and have also made substantial improvements in the rates of pension payable. Any further improvements will be a matter for consideration in the context of future budgets</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for a maximum rate old age contributory pension a person must, amongst other things, have a yearly average of at least 48 full rate contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record. Reduced rates of pension are payable where the yearly average is between ten and 47 contributions.</P>
      <P>The yearly average is the average number of social insurance contributions recorded at the appropriate rate over the period from 1953, or date of entry into insurance, if later, to the last full contribution year before reaching age 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a self-employed person commenced paying social insurance contributions on 6 April 1988, the date that social insurance cover was extended to the self-employed, any earlier social insurance contributions may be disregarded and the yearly average calculated from 6 April 1988. However, where a person commenced paying self employed social insurance contributions on a date after 6 April 1988, the record is assessed in the normal way. However, such a person would, more than likely, have a recent employment record and consequently would not have a significant gap in his-her insurance record. However, measures introduced in recent years make it easier for people with gaps in their insurance record to receive a pension. The reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum <Col N="723" /> payment to ten, introduced in 1997, is of particular benefit to those in this position.</P>
    <P>In August 2000 the report on phase one of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which was undertaken by my Department was published. One of the recommendations involves a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid/credited over a person's working life. This represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, I feel such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public.</P>
    <P>However, much work needs to be done before such a system could be introduced. In particular, the appropriate level of contributions required for a pension needs to be determined and transitional arrangements will also have to be put in place. These and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications involved, are being examined in the context of the second phase of this review which commenced recently. I expect to receive the second phase report later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>I have set out the position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births on a number of occasions to this House in the recent past. Briefly, the position is that prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Secondly, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enhanced child benefit rates payable in the case of twins and other multiple births, give an appropriate level of recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them and fully implement the commitment made in this regard. Furthermore, the child benefit package provided in this year's budget will deliver significant gains to all families with children, including those with twins. Child benefit rates will increase <Col N="725" /> by over 50% from June 2001, a full three months earlier than usual. This marks the first step in a three year programme of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by an additional £1 billion by 2003.</P>
    <P>The question of providing any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins under the child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and other competing priorities. The cost of providing for double child benefit payment for twins is estimated at some £10.2 million in a full year, based on the improved rates recently announced in the budget for 2001.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, including people who have been unemployed for a certain minimum period, to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>Many people have pursued language qualifications with the help of the back to education scheme and have later used their language skills to gain a foothold in the labour market. However, to qualify for participation an unemployed person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be pursuing a course of study at a recognised second or third level institution. The course must be a full-time day course of study which is approved by the Department of Education and Science or have National Council for Educational Awards &ndash; NCEA &ndash; or National Council for Vocational Awards &ndash; NCVA &ndash; recognition. The institute concerned is not so recognised and, therefore, cannot be approved under the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the back to education programmes operated by my Department take cognisance of the fact that many unemployed people wish to pursue part-time courses of education as an alternative to the more structured full-time courses. Unemployed people who wish to pursue part-time education courses may continue to receive their unemployment payment for the duration of the course. The payment of college fees is not a feature of my Department's back to education programmes. The issue of education fees is a mat<Col N="726" /> ter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>People on approved schemes can retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000, substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA. All recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard <Col N="727" /> rules of SWA described earlier, whichever is the greater. The conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. In addition, where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, child dependant allowances &ndash; CDAs &ndash; are paid up to age 22 where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government is committed to extending child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>There are a number of difficulties inherent in the proposal put forward by the Deputy. Following the completion of the senior education cycle, many students pursue further second level education courses which can last up to three years, for example, post leaving certificate courses. The introduction of a provision whereby parents could continue to receive CB until the student completed second level education, regardless of the student's age, could have the effect of conferring CB entitlement on parents for an indefinite period. Furthermore, the proposed measure could raise equity issues in relation to third level students in the same cohort, who are not eligible for CB on reaching 19.</P>
      <P>Any further improvements in the child benefit scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and existing commitments for the future development of the scheme. On the basis of Department of Education and Science data pertaining to 1 January 2000, it is estimated that some 32,000 students could become eligible for CB at a full year cost of approximately £23 million, if CB was payable until the completion of second level education.</P>

      <P>Budget 2001 provided an increase of £8 in the weekly rate of carer's allowance for those recipients aged under 66 years, bringing their rate to £88.50 with effect from April 2001. A similar increase of £8 was awarded to qualified adults under 66 years of old age contributory pensioners, bringing their weekly rate to £68.20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Recipients of carer's allowance aged 66 years and over will receive an increase of £10, bringing their weekly rate to £98.50. However, in the case of qualified adults aged 66 years and over of old age contributory pensioners, a special increase of £15 per week is being awarded, bringing their rate of payment to £79.60. This special increase is in line with the commitment given in budget 2001 to progressively increase the qualified adults allowance for qualified adults over 66 years to the personal rate of old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of the budget increases in April, the rate of carer's allowance will continue to exceed the rate of qualified adults allowance paid to an old age contributory pensioner by £20.30 a week in the case of a carer under 66 years and by £18.90 a week in the case of a carer aged 66 years and over. On completion of the process of progressively increasing the qualified adults allowance for qualified adults over 66 years to the personal rate of old age non-contributory pension, the carer's allowance payable to carers aged 66 years and over will still continue to be ahead of the increased level of qualified adults allowance payable to an old age contributory pensioner.</P>
    <P>In addition to the weekly rates increases for carers, I also provided for a number of other significant improvements for carers in the last budget, including substantial increases in the income disregards from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple; a £100 increase in the respite care grant; and a double respite care grant for a carer looking after two or more people. The many measures I introduced for carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers and are a concrete expression of our appreciation for their valuable role in our society.</P>
    <P>Regarding the national fuel scheme, one of the conditions is that applicants must live alone, or with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance payments or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. In addition, to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. For the purpose of the means test, the weekly income limit is set at the maximum rate of old age contributory pension payable in the family circumstances plus £30. The additional weekly income limit of £30 will be increased to £40 with effect from October 2001.</P>
    <P>In the case outlined by the Deputy where the pensioner is in receipt of the old age contributory pension and their spouse is in receipt of a carer's allowance, the additional £40 per week private pension income would put the combined household income above the prescribed income limit and hence the fuel allowance would not be payable in this case. This will continue to be the case when the weekly income limit is increased in October unless there is any change in the couple's circumstances.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to treatment benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person. Persons must also have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 years must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need. They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record. The lower contribution requirement for a person under 25 is in recognition of the fact that a younger person may have entered insurable employment relatively recently and would have difficulty meeting the higher condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any changes in the insurance conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources.

      <P>Regulations provide for the award of credited PRSI contributions &ndash; credits &ndash; to a former student who re-enters employment which is insurable at full rate PRSI following a course of full-time education which commenced before he or she reached the age of 23 years. This provision is subject to the rules which apply to credits generally, in particular, the condition that these can only be awarded to people who were previously in insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these credits is to ensure that former students are not penalised for any brief earlier attachment to the labour force, for example, by virtue of having engaged in insurable summer work. These credits are awarded from the date of the beginning of the relevant contribution year, currently 6 April, up to the date the insured person re-entered insurance as an employed contributor. In addition, they are awarded in respect of the two previous contribution years before re-entry into insurable employment. The credits are reckonable only for short-term benefits, for example, disability benefit, maternity benefit, etc. In addition, participants on the back to education scheme, the vocational training opportunities scheme or any other approved course which qualifies for the retention of unemployment payments who fulfil the general rule for the award of credits are awarded a social insurance credit in respect of periods spent on these courses. The class of credit awarded depends on the value of the last paid contribution.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the underlying requirement for entitlement to the award of credited contributions is that a person must have worked previously and paid PRSI contributions. The rationale for this condition centres on the general principle that there should be a reasonable link between entitlement to benefit and a recent participation in the active labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of benefit payable to a disability benefit claimant depends on the circumstances of the particular family. In addition to a personal rate of payment &ndash; the current maximum is £77.50 a week &ndash; additional increases are available for qualified adults at a current maximum of £47 a week and for each qualified child at £13.20. A qualified child for disability benefit purposes is a child under age 18.</P>
      <P>While disability benefit is not regarded as a long-term payment for social welfare purposes, a person who has been on disability benefit for at least a year and who expects to remain incapable of work for at least a further year can opt to apply for invalidity pension. Invalidity pension is paid at higher rates than disability benefit. In addition, increases for qualified children are payable up to the age of 22 years or to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday where the child continues in full-time education. Where the child of a disability benefit claimant continues in secondary school beyond 18 years, supplementary welfare allowance may be claimed in respect of that child.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to extend child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education. This commitment will be fulfilled during the lifetime of the programme. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): Employees of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, are issued with contracts of employment setting out their entitlements in accordance with the provisions of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994. Details of subsequent revisions of pay, allowances and other entitlements are issued on an ongoing basis. Inquiries relating to these matters are raised with the local office in the first instance. Where necessary, the local office will, on behalf of any employee, seek any additional clarification that may be required from the relevant head office division.</P>
    <P>As I outlined to the Deputy in my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 486 on 20 March 2001, different employees qualify for different allowances depending on their grade, work location and commencement date. Such allowances derive from central agreements with the relevant trade unions. If the Deputy furnishes me with details regarding the queries to which he refers within the Kilkenny depot, I shall arrange to have the matter examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of fully restoring Portumna Castle was considered by the consultants engaged by my Department to prepare a draft management plan for the Portumna estate. The consultants recommended conservation of the castle itself rather than its full restoration. The reasons for this were to avoid conjecture in any such restoration; the need to study, preserve and present the fabric that does survive; and the possibility offered by the building in its current state of creating a unique experience not to be found elsewhere in Ireland. This recommendation has been <Col N="738" /> accepted by my Department and consequently the installation of timber floors throughout the castle does not arise. I have made £30,000 available this year to complete the installation of the stairway and to provide an enhanced exhibition for visitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has been given responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. Funding of £250 million was allocated to my Department under the national development plan. This funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services. In addition to this £250 million, my Department was allocated £26.5 million in 2001 as part of the Government's £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care.</P>
      <P>Following a recent decision of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion aimed at streamlining the processing of applications for child care facilities, responsibility for £12.5 million towards the child care initiatives targeted at schools has now transferred to my Department from the Department of Education and Science. Of this, £2.5 million is intended to promote the release of spare classrooms for use as child care facilities. Under this initiative, grants will be made available to schools where the management makes spare classrooms available for the provision of child care. The funding available could cover the refurbishment of the classroom as well as heating or insurance costs.</P>
      <P>Prior to the transfer of responsibility for this funding to my Department, the Minister for Education and Science had arranged for a survey of schools to be carried out to ascertain if spare classrooms were available that could be used for child care. This survey involved both primary and post-primary schools. Area Development Management Limited, who administer child care funding measures on behalf of my Department, is now following up on the responses received from the schools in terms of the practicality of the rooms for use as child care facilities. Some £5 million will be used to support schools who develop and manage schools based after school hours child care. It is envisaged that this funding will be targeted at schools and communities which experience significant disadvantage while the remaining £5 million will be open to all schools. These initiatives are still in the developmental stage. Both primary and post-primary schools will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> In addition to its responsibility for the development of child care services in school settings, my Department has also recently taken on responsibility for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs community based out of school hours child care scheme to which £5 million had been allocated.</P>

      <P>I am interpreting the Deputy's question as referring to facilities and services available to offenders prior to and following their release from prison. Offenders, including life sentenced offenders, go through a process of preparation for release into the community and many remain under the supervision of my Department's probation and welfare service while serving the balance of their sentences on release. The service uses a variety of organisations in providing support and facilities for the long-term prisoner.</P>
      <P>Projects in the local community assist in the resettlement of offenders released from custody in providing training programmes and job opportunities. Ongoing efforts are made to provide more projects, subject to acceptance by the local community. These projects are financially assisted by my Department through the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Irish Prisons Service is planning to build half-way house type units at Cork and Limerick prisons for both men and women. It is hoped that these will become operational early in 2002. In the longer term, a similar unit is also planned for Mountjoy prison as part of the refurbishment of the Mountjoy complex. The Dóchas Centre &ndash; Mountjoy women's prison &ndash; already has a pre-release unit which accommodates up to seven prisoners who are generally nearing the end of medium to long-term sentences and are actively engaged in rehabilitative programmes such as education and work training.  The national development plan will also, through prison work programmes such as the CONNECT project, make a significant contribution towards preparing offenders for employment and, in addition, the linkage programme in the community will advance the position of employment placement.</P>

      <P>Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations under international law and the Constitution to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, it represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers in direct provision are generally paid reduced allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Every applicant for supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test, which includes provision for the assessment of any benefit and privilege, including board and lodgings, enjoyed by the applicant. The rates of payment for asylum seekers in direct provision &ndash; £15 per adult and £7.50 per child &ndash; are currently under review by a working group which was established by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for SWA purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, where there are reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments under the SWA scheme will be made by the health boards. Lo-call numbers are made available to asylum seekers in direct provision to assist them in contacting the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in connection with applications for refugee status <Col N="742" /> and appeals against refusal of refugee status, respectively.

        <i>Terms of Reference</i>(1) To review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society.</P>
      <P>(2) In particular, to review the scope for a system of additional licences; to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population, and tourist areas; to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out.</P>
      <P>(3) To examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition.</P>
      <P>(4) To inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>In line with the terms of reference the commission is due to report very shortly on the off-licensed sector. A final report is due by the end of 2002. I will carefully consider the commission's recommendations on receipt of its reports.</P>

      <P>The directorate for asylum support services is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. In this connection in April 2000 it entered into a contract for services with the proprietors of Island View House, Morrisson Island, Cork, for the provision of full board accommodation for 110 asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>On 1 March, 2001 the directorate was faced with a situation where, due to fire safety considerations and on the basis of legal and technical advice, it considered it to be in the interests of the continuing safety of asylum seekers accommodated there to close the hostel as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the directorate, again in the interests of the continuing safety of the asylum seekers, decided that the use of the hostel should cease at the earliest possible moment, that is, the following day, 2 March. The asylum seekers were advised of this by letter on the evening of 1 March and the directorate also arranged for additional precautionary measures to be put in place overnight at the hostel.</P>
      <P>Clearly the directorate would have preferred to have been in a position where more notice of the hostel's closure could have been given to the asylum seekers but in acting as it did, it strongly demonstrated that top priority is given to the safety of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of providing alternative accommodation for the asylum seekers, the situation is that the directorate, at minimum notice, was in a position to do this, in circumstances I might add where there is a severe shortage of accommodation in all sectors throughout the State, at a number of other centres in the Munster and general southern region. Some of the asylum seekers accepted the accommodation offered to them whereas the majority did not. Transport was offered to the asylum seekers to enable them to travel to these alternative locations.</P>
      <P>The directorate could have decided that these alternative arrangements fulfilled its obligations to the asylum seekers and that failure on their part to take up these offers of alternative accommodation was a decision by them, in effect, to render themselves homeless. However, the directorate, motivated by the best interests of the asylum seekers in question, decided that it would endeavour to relocate them in other accommodation and guesthouses in the Cork city and suburban area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the severe practical difficulties in securing such accommodation at short notice, all of the remaining asylum seekers were accommodated in the area. The asylum seekers <Col N="750" /> in question continue to be accommodated in the Cork city and suburban area.</P>

She was informed in writing that she had fourteen days to appeal this decision. Her subsequent appeal was rejected on 6 October, 2000.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the person in question was informed on 27 October, 2000 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 days, leaving the State before the order was made or consenting to the making of the deportation order. Further to that correspondence, her legal representatives submitted various grounds on which the person referred to should be granted leave to remain in the State. Having considered the case file in the light of the relevant statutory provisions, I signed a deportation order in respect of the person referred to on 10 January 2001.</P>
      <P>In that context, I was required to take into account a number of factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, including humanitarian considerations and representations made by or on behalf of the person.</P>

The composition of this committee will include representatives of the following: Garda telecommunications section who will project manage the technical aspects of the system; local crime prevention officers; ESB; local authority; Office of Public Works and local business interests.</P>

      <P>First, I acknowledge the extraordinary efforts that have been made by the general public, business, sporting and voluntary organisations in playing their part regarding the prevention of the spread of foot and mouth disease. This effort is all the more important now that a case of FMD has been confirmed in this country. While there are no proposals to compensate clubs, the Deputy should be aware that disease controls announced on Friday 16 March by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and reaffirmed by the expert group on foot and mouth disease on 22 March last, have enabled a significant number of low risk events and activities in the sports area to recommence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spread of FMD in this country threatens our economic security and livelihoods, not just those of our farmers and the agriculture and food <Col N="754" /> sector, but potentially of virtually every citizen. Therefore we have to be thorough in our efforts to make sure that the disease does not spread with disastrous consequences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 299 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a full day session of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation on 22 March, 11 key industry groups and Bord Fáilte outlined in detail the difficulties currently being experienced by the tourism and hospitality industry and suggested a range of measures which could be taken to alleviate the impact of the current foot and mouth crisis on tourism. In my response, which <Col N="756" /> is on the record of the proceedings of the joint committee, I addressed the key issues raised by the industry groups.</P>
    <P>The special Government task force, of which I am a member, meets daily at present to monitor FMD developments and to review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a separate high level tourism action group, chaired by the chief executive of Bord Fáilte, which includes key industry representatives and an official of my Department, has been established to monitor the situation on a continuous basis. The group is currently meeting twice weekly. The objective is to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business and to help limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects.</P>
    <P>The immediate objectives are to ensure (a) that a clear message is presented to international visitors that Ireland remains open for tourism business subject to appropriate precautions in line with the best expert veterinary advice; (b) that as many of our tourism attractions, including State cultural and heritage attractions, remain open on the basis of the best expert veterinary advice; (c) that Bord Fáilte tourism marketing programmes are fundamentally reappraised and refocused to minimise the potential downturn in overseas visitors numbers and revenue and to address, at the appropriate time, areas of particular need such as County Louth; and (d) that temporary cash flow difficulties experienced by individual tourism enterprises due to the current FMD crisis, again particularly in areas such as County Louth, are taken into account by financial institutions and State agencies as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that I, my Department and Bord Fáilte will continue to work as hard as we can to ensure that no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry which is so important in economic terms.</P>

      <P>Final tourism figures for the year 2000 are not available as yet. I understand the Central Statistics Office plans to publish results for the fourth quarter of the year on Friday, 30 March 2001 with figures for the full year available shortly after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary indications suggest that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland last year increased by more than 4% to 6.2 million. The revenue figures published by the Central Statistics Office for the first nine months of last year <Col N="757" /> show a 21% increase in foreign exchange earnings including a 17% increase in overseas visitor spend.</P>

      <Quest>if an assessment has been made of the North Dublin URBAN Initiative 1997-2000; and the number of projects established under the programme which are still in operation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operational programme for URBAN 1996-1999 was an EU wide operational programme &ndash; OP &ndash; implemented in three geographically defined deprived urban areas to address, in an integrated way, social exclusion by building partnership arrangements between local authorities and other local structures to help in achieving a lasting improvement in the living standards of the people in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The north Dublin area of Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale was one of the three areas selected for <Col N="758" /> funding under the OP URBAN in Ireland 1996-1999. The other two areas were west Tallaght-Clondalkin in south-west Dublin and the northside of Cork city. The north Dublin area was allocated £10.3 million of a total EU and Exchequer funding package of £22.7 million.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the OP, legally binding commitments had to be in place for all projects by 31 December 1999. The final date for expenditure under the programme is 31 December 2001. All available funding under the programme was fully committed by the due date and all of the URBAN element of expenditure on projects has now taken place.</P>
    <P>The external evaluator for the programme is preparing his final evaluation which is expected to be completed shortly and will be submitted to the members of the former monitoring committee. In addition, my Department is in the course of preparing the final report on the OP, for submission to the European Commission, as part of the final claim for EU funds under the programme.</P>
    <P>Last December the board of regeneration of URBAN North Dublin Limited, ROUND, the company established to implement the URBAN programme in Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale, published its own report for the period 1997-2000. This report details all the projects funded by it. An independent evaluation of the north Dublin URBAN action plan, which was commissioned by the ROUND board will, I understand, be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile I am advised that of the 62 projects funded by ROUND, eight were once-off projects, that is, research and feasibility type studies etc. Another 47 projects, including infrastructure projects with once-off capital grants, are still in operation. The remaining seven projects are no longer in operation, one of which ceased activities during the programme, and the others have not received any further funding.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continuing difficulties experienced by St. Joseph's junior school in Ballymun, which has a total staff complement of 35 but has only the use of a school secretary for half of the week; if he will undertake to fund the employment of a full-time secretary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this <Col N="759" /> scheme St. Joseph's junior school has the services of a full-time secretary shared with St. Joseph's senior school, with the post based at the senior school. St. Joseph's junior school also has the services of a full-time caretaker under this scheme.</P>
      <P>A second scheme, introduced under the PESP agreement in 1992, provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service, subject to a maximum of £20,000, a maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I have extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>While the priority has been to ensure that all primary schools are included in the PESP scheme of funding, the position of schools such as St. Joseph's, who are currently involved in a sharing arrangement, will be examined in the context of whatever resources are available later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has reserved sites in the Adamstown area for a primary and a post-primary school, and the question of whether to proceed with the development of these schools is under active consideration at present. I understand that South Dublin County Council is in the course of preparing a proposed plan for Adamstown, which will assist my Department considerably in regard to school provision in that area. The plan is expected to be available towards the end of April 2001. A further site for a primary school has been reserved in the Griffeen/ Foxborough area.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department's planning section meet on a regular basis with the planning department of South Dublin County Council with a view to identifying the need for additional educational provision and reserving sites for schools where required. My Department is also in regular consultation with the existing school providers in Lucan, including Educate Together and gaelscoileanna concerning their needs. Where a shortage of pupil places is identified the appropriate response may be to provide an extension for an existing school or to establish a new school depending on the circumstances.</P>

      <Quest>if compensation will be arranged by his Department in the case of a school (details supplied) which has had to cancel a school trip to France on the instruction of his Department due to foot and mouth disease with the result that deposits have been retained by the travel agent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>An outbreak of foot and mouth disease has the potential to cause enormous economic damage to our agriculture and food processing sectors. It would have far-reaching implications for our export markets, which would permeate through the entire economy. The full commitment of the entire population is necessary if we are to succeed in our efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. This is a national issue which has the potential to adversely affect the wellbeing of everyone in the country and our response must reflect the gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>My Department, based on the advice of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has advised the authorities of all primary and post-primary schools of the recommended measures to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here. My Department continues to liaise on an ongoing basis with the Department as the situation evolves.</P>
      <P>The current advice from my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, is that unnecessary travel to foot and mouth disease infected areas should not take place. Accordingly, I advise schools not to undertake school tours to foot and mouth disease affected areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that deposits for school trips are a matter between individual schools and their travel agents. In the circumstances, for advice on the matters raised by the Deputy, schools should make direct contact with the relevant travel agent.</P>

      <P>My Department is not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might <Col N="762" /> be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
    <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's parents which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with their written permission to contact schools and the national educational psychological service on behalf of their child.</P>

      <Quest>the progress being made on the subject raised in correspondence with him by a person (details supplied) in County Cork; his views on whether a leaving certificate script which on review has the percentage mark raised but falls marginally short of an increased grade, should be the subject of further inspection by a second appeal examiner, in view of the contents of the letter; and if he will arrange for a final decision to be communicated on this matter to the person.</Quest>

      <P>The leaving certificate appeals process provides a candidate with an opportunity to have his/her script fully re-marked. This re-marking is done, in accordance with the original marking scheme, by an experienced examiner who is different from the original examiner. The objective of the appeal process is to detect and correct any error that may have occurred in the original marking and in doing so to ensure that all candidates are treated in a fair and even-handed manner. To introduce a further re-marking process for a particular category of candidate, as outlined by the Deputy, would not be in accord with the principle of inter-candidate equity, which applies to the existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that candidates could be confident in the correct processing of their appeal, my Department appointed examination commissioners who were given the power to examine all documentation relating to an appeal, including the candidate's script, before deciding if the appeal was properly processed or not.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the examination commissioners have examined all documentation relating to the candidate's appeal in Irish and are satisfied that the appeals procedures were fully adhered to by my Department. This information was communicated to the candidate in November 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 315 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of temporary accommodation has been completed at St. Anne's and St. Thomas's national schools, Esker, Lucan, County Dublin. Tenders for the roof repair works at the schools are currently being evaluated by the school's design team. The removal of asbestos will be incorporated into the contract for the roof works and this will be carried out in consultation with the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>A report has been carried out on the drainage system at St. Thomas's national school and remedial works on the drainage system will be included in the contract. A survey will be carried out on the drainage system of St. Anne's national school.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction of any project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit, the period required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. Consequently, it is not possible at this point to provide a timeframe as to when the projects at St. Anne's and St. Thomas's national schools will proceed to construction.</P>
      <P>The school authorities will be kept informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317, 325 to 327, inclusive, 344, 353 and 354 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware the funding arrangements for our schools, including funding of secretaries/caretakers, cleaning and insurance, have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Blackstock report represents a comprehensive review of these funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>In this connection I have already shown my commitment by establishing the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date in the light of available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may know, the Government has recently decided in principle to establish a body to compensate those persons who, as children, were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory responsibility. This <Col N="768" /> compensation process will not cover those persons who may have been abused while attending day schools.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to provide for this particular type of compensation scheme is based upon the fact that the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not have the care and protection which children in the care of their parents enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that, notwithstanding that duty, children were abused. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families while at school and so the decision to set up a compensation body does not extend to them.</P>
      <P>The Government has already provided an alternative means of redress for any person who suffered sexual abuse in the past. The recent amendment to the Statute of Limitations Act, passed in June 2000, recognises that persons who suffered sexual abuse in the past may not have been in a position, due to the abuse suffered, to take legal action against the abuser. Normally a person would only have three years to bring such an action. The Act now provides that the normal period of three years within which a person can bring an action will not apply where a person is suffering from such a disability.</P>
      <P>The Act also recognises that some persons who suffered sexual abuse may have been previously advised that their claims were statute barred. To assist such persons in bringing a claim, the Act provided for a special one year window, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow such persons to commence actions against their abusers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 329 and 330 together.</P>
      <P>The focus of my Department's support for children with special needs, including children with autism, is on the development of school-based services for the children in question. Support is not generally provided to train the mothers of such children to assist with their educational development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a range of new measures to enhance the level and quality of special edu<Col N="771" /> cation services for children with autism. These measures include the development of a nationwide pre-school education service for children with autism, the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism, and a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>I recently established a special task force to review current educational responses to the needs of children with autism and to make recommendations on the future development of services in this area. I expect to receive the report of the task force next month and I will be giving careful consideration to its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I understand that my Department has no record of an application for a special educational support service for the child in question. I can assure the Deputy that any such application would be fully considered by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is implementing two early school leaving initiatives at present.</P>
      <P>The eight to 15 early school leaver initiative was introduced on a pilot basis in September 1998 and involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. Its purpose is to develop and test models of the delivery of supports for those young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage or are outside the formal school system while still of compulsory schoolgoing age. In 2000, I extended the initiative in the existing 17 projects for the period 1 July 2000 to August 2002.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the 8 to 15 early school leaver initiative will be expanded, by invitation, to additional schools and projects which will be chosen on the basis of need and objective criteria. Work is currently under way on the identification of the new areas and schools. I would like to assure the Deputy that the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched, initially in 58 schools. This marked a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. In May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative includes four schools in County Wexford. It is expected that further invitations will issue to schools to participate in the future. The selection of schools for invitation to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle. For some time my Department has been involved in a detailed analysis of data from individual schools which has allowed a more complete picture of early school leaving to be developed than has been the case in the past. This has allowed resources under the stay in school initiative to be targeted at schools through which they should <Col N="775" /> reach the greatest possible number of young people at risk.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Christian Brothers secondary school in Wexford town and some other schools which have not been invited to participate in the initiative have planned and, in some cases, are implementing programmes to support those of their pupils who are at risk. I appreciate that these schools are doing very valuable work to retain young people in school.</P>
    <P>The current method used to select schools for invitation into the initiative will be reviewed prior to issuing invitations to any further schools to participate in the initiative. The selection procedure will continue to target resources to where they benefit the greatest possible number of young people at risk. Consideration will, however, also be given to the possibility of providing supports for those schools who are already successfully implementing programmes to retain their most vulnerable pupils in school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three-year per<Col N="776" /> iod and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage in relation to the school.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and the circumstances of these schools would then be further considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question have now been forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. In order to advance consideration of this school's situation, additional information is required by the ERC. To this end, a letter from the ERC and a questionnaire to be filled out by the school principal was forwarded to the school on 20 March. The school has been advised that the completed questionnaire should be returned to the ERC by 6 April. As soon as the ERC has received and assessed the questionnaire and reported to my Department, the school will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at present to establish a third level institute in Lucan.</P>
      <P>The future development of higher education in the west Dublin region is guided by the recommendations of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, which the Government approved in July 1996 as a benchmark for future planning in the technology sector. In accordance with its remit, the committee reviewed the existing provisions and needs for higher education in specific areas. As a response to the higher education needs of west Dublin, the steering committee anticipated that Tallaght Regional Technical College and the provision of a new facility in the north-west region would serve the greater Clondalkin and Lucan region. This new facility, Blanchardstown Institute of Technology, was subsequently established in 1999 and was officially opened in November 2000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained in commenting specifically on the case to which he refers due to the fact that the appeal in this matter opened in the Supreme Court today. The Supreme Court is the most appropriate forum where the legal and constitutional matters at issue can now be discussed and determined.</P>
      <P>The High Court judgment in the case in question has raised issues that are of such fundamental importance to the education system and to the system of State administration and expenditure that they require clarification by the Supreme Court. The Government considers that it has an obligation, in the public interest, to clarify these matters and establish, in particular, precisely what is the nature and extent of the State's duty in the matter of the provision for free primary education for adults. The appeal will not affect damages which have already been paid to Jamie Sinnott and I have already put procedures in place so that all damages awarded to him on foot of the High Court judgment will be paid on an<i> ex gratia</i> basis as soon as possible. Irrespective of the outcome of the appeal, there is no question of these damages being refunded. Fifteen thousand pounds in special damages have also been paid to Mrs. Sinnott and will not be affected by the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding and even misrepresentation of the Government's position on this appeal. In particular, the <Col N="780" /> impression has been created that the Government wants to overturn the O'Donoghue judgment, which relates to the constitutional rights of children to a primary education, whatever their level of disability. Nothing could be further from the truth. I accept my constitutional duty, on behalf of the State, to provide for the free primary education of all children. I assure the House that I regard it as unacceptable that any parent, and particularly a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their child's educational entitlements. This Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in special education services. The number of special needs assistants supporting special needs children has been increased from less than 300 to more than 1,700. Additional resource teachers and special needs assistants are being allocated by my Department as needs are identified. I am aware that much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements that should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of high quality co-ordinated services at all stages of education for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the further development of an effective special education service, which will remove the need for parents to have to resort to litigation to secure their entitlements. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of circular 12/96, delegated authority to grant exemptions from learning Irish, within the conditions laid down in the circular, has been vested in the individual school authority. In the case referred to by the Deputy, if the school authority is refusing to grant an exemption that is warranted under the terms of the circular, the matter can be brought to the attention of the primary administration section. The matter <Col N="781" /> should in the first instance be raised with the school in question. However, the circular specifically provides for the granting of an exemption from the studying of Irish for pupils who have a specific learning difficulty, such as dyslexia, of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the mother tongue.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the lack of funding for the vocational training opportunities scheme in Rosmuc in view of the fact that when it was set up in 1989, it was allocated £15,000 per year and the allocation has not changed in the past 12 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>VTOS Rosmuc is a centre offering second chance education in the west Galway region. It was inaugurated in 1999 and now has 16 students in full-time attendance.</P>
      <P>The general VTOS was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses &ndash; when they reside three miles or more from the centre &ndash; and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 people participate annually in the VTOS at an annual cost to the State of £32 million. The VTOS has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years from 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The funding referred to in the question is the grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees for expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The rate of the grant is £15,000 per core group of 20 VTOS students. It has not been found possible to increase this rate in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is, 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of long-term unemployed people in education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants for childcare for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by childcare responsibilities. An adult educational guidance service has been initiated on a pilot basis and a new management structure has been developed for the programme.</P>
    <P>In 2000, VTOS Rosmuc received a special grant to purchase information technology equipment.</P>
    <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on adult education Learning for Life. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>The new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, that I announced on 4 January last, will run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of more than 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to more than 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. St. Patrick's infants national school is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,665 towards the provision of <Col N="785" /> suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils, including St. Patrick's infants national school, will also be supported where necessary over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes. Under the new programme, the school will benefit from the appointment of two additional teaching posts in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The staffing schedule for primary schools in the 2001-02 school year has not yet been finalised. As soon as the schedule is finalised, a circular will issue to all boards of management. This staffing schedule will apply to all primary schools, including schools participating in the new programme.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to urban schools, eligible for additional teaching posts under the programme, is that the allocation of new posts is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three-year period and the implementation of the maximum class sizes. The staffing allocation for these schools for the 2001-02 school year will be based on the enrolment in the school at 30 September 2000 and will be examined in the context of any changes to the staffing schedule for national schools.</P>

      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in primary schools has been increased from 104 to more than 750. The number of special needs assistants supporting special needs children has <Col N="786" /> been increased from less than 300 to more than 1,700 over the same period. Additional resource teachers and special needs assistants are being allocated by my Department as needs are identified.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs of second level age are generally catered for in ordinary second level schools with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. There are 273 resource teachers and 135 special needs assistants in second level schools at present.</P>
      <P>Where more serious disabilities are involved, the children are catered for in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to particular disabilities. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil-teacher ratios and attract special needs assistant support in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee. The special schools generally cater for pupils with special needs from the age of four up to the end of the school year during which they reach their 18th birthday. Young persons leaving the special school system have access to a range of vocational training centres or other special facilities where my Department funds tuition services.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, my Department extended the remedial teaching service to every first and second-level school in the country with a pupilteacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower ratios can also have access to this service where they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department makes funding available for the purchase of computers and other equipment for children with special needs. This year, I have increased the level of funding in this area from £987,000 to £2,730,000.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service is currently available to all second level schools and will be developed to provide nation-wide coverage to all primary schools by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>While this Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in special education services, I am fully aware that much more work remains to be done before we can be satisfied that all children with special needs are receiving the support they require when and where they require it.</P>
      <P>A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements that should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of education for students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of an effective special education service. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures at the earliest possible date.</P>
