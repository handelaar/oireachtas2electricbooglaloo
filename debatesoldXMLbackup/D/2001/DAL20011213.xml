      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the failure of the Government to introduce a code of ethical standards for Members of the Oireachtas and all public representatives in the light of the damage being done to public confidence in politics by the shortcomings of Deputy Lawlor and the Government which he supports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that the late sitting be extended to allow time for the adoption, under the Standards in Public Offices Act, which was commenced on the 10th of this month, of a code of conduct for Members so that we can apply standards to Members who defy orders of this House in tribunals set up by this House. Will the Minister, on behalf of the Government, agree to provide time, today or tomorrow, to formally adopt the code of conduct for Members already laid before the House by the committee that deals with Members' interests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin. This matter has been agreed by the Members' interests committee and I believe there is broad consensus. In the wake of recent events, there is clear urgency about having such a code adopted and I ask the Government to make the time available for that in the next two days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the late sitting on the basis that it is obviously not late enough to deal comprehensively with the business laid down. I ask that the Minister withdraw the referendum Bill so that we can deal with it more properly in the New Year and deal with the other business more fully as well. Apart from that, we need to extend the late sitting and, therefore, I oppose the proposal.</P>

      <P>On the matter raised by the opposition parties, in February of this year the Labour Party introduced a Private Members' Bill on a code of conduct and the Government sup<Col N="1053" /> ported it. It required the Members' interests committee to draw up a code of conduct and the committee reported in May 2001 on a draft code of conduct. The Standards in Public Office Bill was passed by this House, it provided for a code of conduct and that Bill came into effect three days ago, on 10 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as an infringement on our entitlements on this side of the House. Not only are we having a guillotine but there is an attempt to prevent even comment on the individual motions which include the Social Welfare Bill, the imposition of charges on people making objections to planning applications, which is fundamental to our democracy, and a referendum Bill which is being put through at an extraordinary speed for an issue of significance. That is not the way to handle this and, on this side of the House, we will oppose this Order. We will, very specifically, oppose the introduction of charges for members of the public &ndash; even public representatives &ndash; to make objections to planning proposals. This has gone to the heart of the way the public&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question is a matter for you, a Cheann Comhairle. I consider it wrong that four completely different items &ndash; the full Order of Business for tomorrow &ndash; are being put in a single motion. We do not have a chance to address the individual components that are being guillotined tomorrow. Therefore, I have to deal with them individually now, in one go. On No. 25, the motion on planning and development regulations, can I ask the Minister whether that is being pursued tomorrow? It is our understanding that a number of Government backbenchers had a meeting with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government this morning and that yet another climb-down by the Minister is imminent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we are ordering business for tomorrow, I wish to know if adequate time be provided to debate other matters and if the Government has again changed its mind. It is difficult for the Opposition to deal with today's Order of Business because there have already been six revisions to it this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to, but I am being barracked from both sides. In relation to the order in question, will it remain in place or has there been another climb-down?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally undemocratic and unprecedented for a Social Welfare Bill to receive so little scrutiny in the House. There was a truncated two hour debate on Second Stage and, under this omnibus motion, Report and Final Stages are to be guillotined in the morning.</P>
      <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer is the Referendum Bill. Are there no standards left in this House? This Bill, which will define the conduct of referenda, was published 48 hours ago. When answering questions from the leader of the Labour Party yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that the Bill would not be taken until after Christmas. However, we have been informed that all Stages will be taken tomorrow and that a guillotine will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that tomorrow's business is being dealt with in the form of one motion. This is turning what ought to be a season of good<Col N="1056" /> will into one of deception and underhandedness on the part of the Government. Various Bills will be guillotined tomorrow. Dealing with the Referendum Bill in this way will leave a bad taste in the mouth. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution gave a great deal of consideration to the issue of referenda and stated that variance with judicial interpretation would require constitutional amendment. This has enormous implications when one considers that all Stages of the Bill will be rushed through before the end of business tomorrow. In the interests not only of the House but of democracy it is important that we re-establish some form of standard by ensuring that the Bill will not be taken tomorrow, that it will be given the consideration it requires, that people inside and outside the House will have the opportunity to debate it fully and that it will be the subject of a constitutional amendment when, and if, it is enacted.</P>
      <P>It is stated that the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, will be taken tomorrow without debate. This will leave a bad taste in the mouths of many of those concerned with the planning process, particularly because the Christmas and holiday periods are renowned for the sharp practice of making cloak and dagger planning applications in the hope that people will be away from home or will not be paying full attention to what is going on. To add insult to injury, people will be asked to pay money to articulate their concerns and display their interest in the common good. The Ceann Comhairle must re-establish the kind of standards people expect by not allowing the Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Ceann Comhairle give the Government an opportunity to change the Order of Business thereby ensuring that we will have adequate time to debate the measures before us. These measures should not be taken tomorrow and, if they are, a guillotine should not be applied. The Social Welfare Bill requires far more time for debate than that which is being provided. The State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Bill will have ramifications not just for this generation but for future generations who will be expected to pay for public services they might otherwise have expected to have been paid for by the State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The way business is being handled this morning brings the House to a low level of public esteem. Essentially, three huge issues have been dealt with by a single guillotine motion. They involve charging people for making democratic representations about planning, raiding the social insurance fund into which people have put their hard earned money over the years and the rights of citizens to vote in a constitutional referendum. These are fundamental issues and the way they have been dealt with this morning, where Members did not even have their questions answered, is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>We should not allow the final day of the session to be handled in such an abrupt way. The Government has a duty to all sides of the House to allocate reasonable time to deal with these issues. The proposal to adjourn after such a debacle is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Four important issues will be dealt with tomorrow in a truncated way. There is no logic in adjourning the House until the end of January. It could resume at least a week earlier and deal in a rational way with, for example, the Referendum Bill. Members would like time to reflect on that Bill with a view to improving it so that the conduct of referenda, which is a critical part of our democracy, can be sane and rational. Many Members have experience and useful ideas to bring forward in relation to the conduct of referenda, none of which can be entertained because of the Bill being guillotined tomorrow. Can we adjust the date for the recess and return at least a week, if not a fortnight, earlier to deal with business in a rational way so progress can be made? That would accord some respect to Members of Parliament and to the parliamentary process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the conduct of referenda, we have had the experience of Nice and the grave concerns about how that referendum was conducted. It is nothing short of scandalous that we should try to amend the legal framework of the Referendum Commission in the way proposed and through a Bill that was published only 48 hours ago. It is wrong and if the Minister would give it a moment of reflection she would accept the logic of my remarks. Can a formal agreement be made to resume sitting one week earlier in <Col N="1061" /> January and to defer consideration of at least two of the four items to be truncated tomorrow so they can be dealt with in a sane way in late January? There is no earthly reason that the House cannot resume before 30 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel punch drunk by the blunt, quick fire guillotine exercised by the Government with regard to the proposals before us. I am not sure whether to object because I believe the session should be elongated to provide more time or because there is no point returning in the new year since the Government has removed the basic role of this Parliament in deciding matters of legislation. In the process it has tried to sabotage the Referendum Commission and to ensure that not only must people pay to have a say in planning applications but also that no planning applications will be required for mobile phone masts. This is, essentially, government by diktat because Parliament is rendered ineffective by the Government's guillotining habits. This proposal must be <Col N="1062" /> opposed. Reason should prevail and the House should sit for longer and return earlier. We should deal with these matters without recourse to the guillotine and we should allow people to have a say, particularly with regard to the Referendum Commission. If there is a change in the judicial interpretation of the law, it should go to the people and be decided by referendum. That is a basic requirement and we should stand by it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the statement by a former director of Eircom that the shareholders were duped and on a report that the then chairman of Eircom went to the Minister directly to warn that the Government risked exposing small investors to significant losses? This advice proved to be prophetic with half a million investors losing on average £1,000 each. Why was this high level advice from the chairman of Eircom rebuffed by the Government?</P>

      <P>On Deputy Richard Bruton's question, there was a meeting at that time, I think, with the chairman. I would have to see the minutes, but as far as I remember, there was a general meeting with the chairman. Clearly, the Government sub-committee decided the price and it based that on the advice of the financial consultants to the Government. It was a middle price between both. To answer Deputy Howlin's question, there was an understanding &ndash; not legal, but vocal &ndash; between the Government and Eircom that it would get 10 million which could be put towards various matters of public interest, particularly education and so on. So far, that has not been paid.</P>

Does she not feel some responsibility for the substantial loss of nest eggs which people had put away &ndash; £1,000 each for the half a million families? These were significant nest eggs put away to try to deal with times like those we are now entering. Does the Minister not feel a sense of guilt and responsibility to small shareholders for the failure of this flotation?</P>

      <P>I join with Deputies Howlin and Richard Bruton in aligning ourselves to the huge sense of personal loss suffered by the people of Omagh. That has now been rekindled, especially coming up to the Christmas season and given that they have read this report. Yesterday the Taoiseach said the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland had a key role to play in ensuring that the Police Service of Northern Ireland is held fully accountable to the community it serves. The report on the Omagh bombing released yesterday raises many questions and makes a number of recommendations. It is important that these are addressed in a manner which ensures that the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those most immediately affected by the bombing, can be satisfied that there is the fullest possible clarity and accountability for what happened in the lead-up to the bombing and the investigation that followed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the disposal of the shares of the Minister for Finance in ACC Bank plc to Rabobank Nederland, pursuant to section 5(2) of the ACC Bank Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>At the end of January this year the Minister for Finance mandated the board of ACC Bank plc to prepare the bank for sale and to pursue all options for a change of ownership by the end of this year. As part of this exercise, the board launched a sale process last February. This process has culminated in a deal under which the Exchequer will receive 140.4 million from Rabobank in respect of the 85.1% of shares that will be held by the Minister. The Exchequer will also receive a further 12.2 million from the ESOT in respect of the 9.9% stake in ACC that it is purchasing bringing total receipts to the Exchequer to almost 153 million.</P>
    <P>This sale process has been managed by the board of ACC Bank, which recommended to the Minister for Finance on 18 October last that the bank should enter into negotiations with Rabobank on the basis of its firm bid valuing the bank at 165 million. The Minister accepted this recommendation and contract negotiations were concluded on 4 December and the board recommended the terms of the contract to the Minister. An information memorandum containing the main terms of the deal has been circulated to all Members.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 (2) of the ACC Bank Act, 2001, the Minister is required to obtain a motion of approval from the House prior to disposing of any shares in ACC Bank other than to staff in connection with an employee share ownership trust. Before outlining the terms of the sale, I pay tribute to the role that ACC Bank, originally established as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, played in supporting the development of Irish agriculture since 1927. Until 1988 the Agricultural Credit Corporation was confined by legislation to providing credit for the agricultural industry. The Agricultural Credit Act, 1988, allowed the corporation to deploy up to 25% of its risk assets outside agriculture and in 1992 the legislation was amended to allow ACC Bank, as it was renamed, to become a fully-fledged bank. The bank has grown considerably over the years. It had a slow start and total lending between 1928 and 1988 amounted to only £7.5 million. The outstanding lending on the balance sheet now amounts to over 2.3 billion or £1.8 billion. It should also be pointed out that the bank is still closely involved in the agricultural sector even though it has expanded its portfolio of products and services over the last ten years. Approximately 20% of its income is derived from lending to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government made a decision in principle in mid-1998 in favour of disposing of the State's interest in ACC Bank. Following this decision the Minister subsequently accepted a proposal from the board of ACC Bank and the trustees of TSB Bank, with the backing of the staff of both banks, that they should be <Col N="1070" /> merged and floated. After a great deal of work by all the parties involved, the Minister reluctantly accepted the recommendation of the board of ACC Bank and the trustees of TSB Bank in January 2000 that the project be abandoned. The trustees of TSB Bank subsequently carried out a sale process in 2000 which culminated in the successful sale of the bank to Irish Life and Permanent plc. In relation to ACC Bank, the Minister asked the board to review all options for the future and reiterated his view that the current <i>status quo</i> was not an option. As I have already said, the Minister mandated the board in January this year to pursue a change in ownership by the end of this year. This process has concluded with the successful sale of the bank to Rabobank Nederland.</P>
    <P>On 4 December, the board recommended that the Minister accept an offer for ACC Bank which values the bank at 165 million. The Minister's corporate advisers, Merrion Corporate Finance, examined the offer and the board's recommendation and have advised the Minister that the offer represents fair value for the bank and should be accepted. Merrion Corporate Finance and A &amp; L Goodbody, the Minister's legal advisers, have also examined the sale process as outlined to them by the board of ACC Bank and its advisers, NCB Corporate Finance and Matheson Ormsby Prentice, and concluded that the sale process has been carried out in a fair, open and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>On that basis, the Minister accepted the offer from Rabobank subject to Dáil Éireann passing this motion of approval for the disposal of his shares. I will now outline the other main terms of the deal, which are set out in further detail in the information memorandum distributed to Deputies last Tuesday. Rabobank sought an indemnity in respect of any litigation against ACC, such as that arising from ACC's involvement in the syndicated loan for the Four Seasons Hotel and an indemnity has been given in certain strictly defined circumstances. I cannot disclose the nature and scope of this indemnity for reasons of legal and commercial confidentiality. Any such disclosure at this stage could affect the conduct of litigation that falls within the scope of the indemnity and be potentially damaging to the interests of the Exchequer and, by extension, taxpayers. The provision of this indemnity is an appropriate solution to issues which would otherwise have been a major obstacle to the sale of the bank. Taking into account all the relevant factors, the Minister has made the commercial judgment that the provision of an indemnity is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Rabobank has stated that it is their intention not to create compulsory redundancies in ACC Bank as a result of this transaction. In connection with the sale process, Rabobank has also given a specific commitment to staff representatives that there will be no compulsory redundancies in the 18 months following completion of the sale.</P>
    <P>Rabobank's financial strength and standing is a significantly positive aspect of the offer. Given the structure of funding of ACC Bank's deposits <Col N="1071" /> and borrowings, it is important that any purchaser should be of sufficient financial standing and strength to secure the current and future funding of the bank. I am glad that Rabobank has such a standing.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that over the years various State guarantees have been given in relation to deposits placed with ACC Bank. For some time there has been a policy in place of limiting and reducing the level of guarantees provided. The level of guarantees will be further reduced as facilities mature and as alternative facilities are made available. Meanwhile Rabobank is providing a counter-indemnity in respect of the outstanding funds that are State guaranteed, currently just under 600 million. Given the continuing, though reducing, guarantee which the State will be providing on some of ACC Bank's funding pending maturity, it is important that the party giving the State a counter-indemnity covering such guarantees is of appropriate quality and strength. Again, Rabobank provides such financial strengths.</P>
    <P>In line with the sale of other semi-State companies, an employee share ownership trust will be established for the benefit of staff. The terms of the ESOT were negotiated between the management and staff representatives of ACC and subsequently overwhelmingly approved by the staff in a ballot. In return for entering into the transformation agreement, the Minister will transfer 5% of the shares in ACC to the ESOT. The transformation agreement provides that the staff will co-operate with the change of ownership process. Included in the arrangements to which the staff are committed under this deal is the voluntary separation scheme, which has already commenced. The board's intention under this scheme is that staff numbers can, by agreement, be reduced by up to 200 from the staff levels at the start of 2000. This is a significant element in the transformation undertaken by the bank and its staff.</P>
    <P>Another element in the ESOT will be the purchase of 9.9% of the shares in ACC for 12.2 million funded through borrowings and the bank buying out part of the staff's bonus scheme. The total ESOT shareholding is to be sold to Rabobank in return for a Rabobank bond. The bond will be held by the ESOT in the way that shares would otherwise have been held. This is because the co-operative ownership structure of Rabobank does not allow for the ESOT to hold shares. The Minister will be proposing the necessary legislative amendments to the ESOP legislation in the Finance Bill to allow the ACC Bank ESOT to hold and distribute the Rabobank bond from within the ESOT. Based on the estimated staff numbers, the ESOT will be worth on average about 50,000 to each staff member. The ESOT's borrowings will be repaid partly through a 5% profit sharing arrangement subject to a cumulative limit of 6.35 million and partly from the interest income on the bond.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Regarding the strategy the purchaser will follow with ACC Bank, Rabobank Nederland is, as I have already said, a co-operative entity that grew from a rural base in the Netherlands. It is the only non-state guaranteed bank with the highest credit ratings from all the major rating agencies. It is a very large organisation, with assets of more than 378 billion and more than 55,000 employees in 36 countries. In the Netherlands, it controls 40% of the savings market, 85% of the agricultural credit market, 25% of retail mortgages and 40% of lending to small and medium sized enterprises. It operates in Ireland through three subsidiaries in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Rabobank's acquisition of ACC is part of its strategy of developing rural-based banking in developed countries with strong agricultural sectors, a strategy which has been pursued in Australia and New Zealand. Although Rabobank intends to operate ACC Bank on a stand-alone basis, it can be expected that it will provide support, expertise, new products and technology to its new subsidiary, as appropriate. It is hard to think of a more suitable parent company for ACC Bank. Many Deputies and Senators recognised the need for ACC to move on during the debate on the ACC Bank Act, 2001. Some were concerned, however, that the character of the bank and its rural branch network would change as a result of its sale. I am pleased ACC is to be bought by a bank with rural roots and which recognises and will develop the strengths of ACC. The bank will also pursue its current strategy of providing banking services to the SME sector and to personal customers.</P>
    <P>The offer is favourable and fair. The purchase of ACC by Rabobank Nederland has advantages for the banks and for staff and customers. I am certain it will increase competition in the Irish banking sector. I thank the board of ACC, under the chairmanship of Padraic O'Connor, and the employees who have contributed to transformation of the bank and the successful completion of the sale process. I am pleased the interests of ACC's staff, the new owners and the State, as the former shareholder, coincide in the passage of this company into the private sector. The sale of ACC will bring the State's involvement as an owner in the banking industry to an end. The sale of ICC Bank to Bank of Scotland has improved competition in the SME lending market, while the sale of TSB Bank to Irish Life and Permanent has added to competitiveness in the retail financial market.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, the sale of ACC Bank to Rabobank is an improvement on the current position. The manner in which the State's interest in banking has been disposed of will enhance competition while providing opportunities for staff and strong support for customers. I do not doubt that in years to come, those who look back on this process will conclude that it was not only wise from the point of view of the banks concerned, but also that it was done in a manner which was <Col N="1073" /> in the best interests of the State and the banking market. I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party warmly welcomes this motion and will not oppose it, but a few matters need to be made clear. ACC Bank, which was established to serve the agricultural sector, has served this country well. It operates a successful network of 42 branches, mainly in provincial towns. Its dedicated and enthusiastic employees worked hard to build up the ACC and to attract a high volume of business. The Minister of State quoted some statistics which make evident the level of ACC's business. The bank's recent problems should not be ascribed to the lower echelons of its staff, but to its management. I hope these difficulties have been put behind the bank and that it can move forward as a result of its purchase by Rabobank Nederland. The selling price of about £132 million represents a tremendous bargain, given that Rabobank is to receive 42 branches, staff with great expertise and a presence throughout the country. It can be argued that the selling price should have been higher, but perhaps the current economic climate means that it is the best price that could be obtained. The transaction is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Across the banking sector, there is a common and conventional price to earnings ratio. When concluding the debate on this motion, I would like the Minister of State to outline to the House the ratio of ACC Bank. How does it compare to the ratio in the banking sector generally?</P>

      <P>My party welcomes the sale of ACC, especially the fact that there will not be compulsory redundancies in the bank for at least 18 months. I hope this is written in stone and it would be marvellous if, after 18 months, Rabobank decides not to chop and change. I note the purchasers have indicated a willingness to retain the 42 branches of ACC throughout the country and I hope a firm commitment has been made.</P>
      <P>The performance of Rabobank Nederland to date is tremendously encouraging. The Minister mentioned in his speech that Rabobank is owned by 385 independent local co-operative banks which, in turn, are owned by local members. The Minister mentioned that the co-operative now operates in 36 countries and has a staff of 55,000 people. It is an enormous company by any standards and particularly by Irish standards. It has assets of 378 billion, which is a huge amount of money, even more than the Acting Chairman has in the bank. Its profit level, however, seems small by banking sector standards, especially given its assets which I have outlined. I know the Minister cannot comment, but I hope he will clarify this matter when he gets the chance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a large organisation, with 9 million customers, is entering the Irish market and I hope it will provide a nationwide banking service. Deputies have often said there is not enough competition in the banking sector and the demise of the local banks in small provincial towns has often been mourned. The bigger Irish banks have chosen to reduce their branch networks, and it is to be hoped Rabobank will fill the void and competitively market its products in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>Its experience of serving rural communities in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands will enable it to develop a strong foothold in rural communities here. In recent times, ACC has encouraged people to open accounts in rural branches. It is interesting to note that, as regards the special savings scheme, ACC Bank offered what neutral analysts suggested was the best package. I understand from ACC Bank staff that the money flowed in and the bank opened a large number of new accounts and attracted new customers as a result of the attractive package it offered on the special savings scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> I welcome the sale of ACC Bank to Rabobank Nederland which is the right kind of institution to operate in Ireland. I look forward to the continued operation of the 42 branches in provincial towns. I note the employee share option scheme involving 14.9% of shares which has been overwhelmingly welcomed and accepted by the staff of ACC Bank. There will be no compulsory redundancies and the network of branches will be maintained. I welcome this sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing time. I wish to return to the important issue of the indemnity. Deputy McGrath pointed out that ACC Bank is being sold to Rabobank for about £132 million which is a relatively good deal. However, if one takes the indemnity clause into account it is a very good deal for Rabobank because it is exempted from any litigation which may be taken against ACC Bank.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said in his speech that Rabobank sought an indemnity in respect of any litigation against ACC such as that arising from the Four Seasons. Is it usual that any litigation would be covered in the purchase of a bank by another financial institution? The Minister of State's speech seemed to suggest that we are not only talking about the indemnity regarding the Four Seasons, but that there may be other cases of litigation against ACC Bank. If the Minister of State cannot clarify this issue now, will he come back to us at a later stage? The Minister of State also stated that the provision of this indemnity is an appropriate solution to these issues which would otherwise have been a major obstacle to the sale of the bank. I raised this issue about 18 months ago inside and outside the House and pointed out that there would be a major obstacle regarding the sale of the bank because of potential litigation involving the Four Seasons and other deals.</P>
      <P>As regards the terms of the agreement, the Minister of State pointed out that there are certain strictly defined circumstances regarding the indemnity. Can he outline these circumstances without jeopardising commercial confidentiality? Is the Four Seasons the only case involved or is there the potential for other cases which the State would have to indemnify?</P>
      <P>If ACC Bank loses the case, the liability could be in excess of £10 million. I do not wish to address the issue of the litigation which is before the courts, but I question the security obtained by ACC Bank regarding the Four Seasons loan. The favourable loan conditions, and the fact that ACC Bank was in the unbelievable position of not having first call on the assets, raises serious questions. The Bank of Scotland, which is taking an action against ACC Bank, had an opt-out clause without incurring losses. Everyone except ACC Bank seems to have secured a good deal and put protections in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it that Marlast Limited, a company registered in the Virgin Islands, rather than ACC <Col N="1076" /> Bank has first call on the Four Seasons assets? No one would obtain a loan from a bank without some protection regarding assets. However, ACC Bank was prepared to provide a loan to Harvard Properties to develop the Four Seasons Hotel without having first call on the assets. A company registered in the Virgin Islands has first call on these assets. Who is Marlast Limited, and who controls it? Surely ACC Bank must have been aware of who controlled this company.</P>
    <P>One of the directors of Harvard Properties, the developers of the Four Seasons Hotel, was the former chairman of ACC Bank, Mr. Dan McGing. This raises serious questions regarding the handling of this loan, the reason the bank did not have first call on the assets and whether this case is the only one which may result in a potential liability which the State will have to cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing time. As a result of this deal, ACC Bank will become a large institution with nine million customers. The bank has served the country, particularly farmers, well. Farmers went through difficult times, particularly in the early 1980s, and ACC Bank steered agriculture through that period. At a time when interest rates were high, the bank made provision for, and facilitated, people. We all know of cases in which the bank was very helpful.</P>
      <P>The merged bank will have nine million customers. However, when some of the co-ops became bigger they lost sight of many small customers who were loyal to them over the years. Smaller customers who have been loyal to ACC Bank should not be forgotten in such a large operation with nine million customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture has experienced significant changes in the past number of years. The Green Paper on Rural Development included many proposals, such as the expansion of the mushroom industry. ACC Bank was not forthcoming in financing this area. Monaghan Mushrooms expanded its operations into Tipperary where it had many customers. The company approached ACC Bank in this regard but it would not finance any of the projects. That was disappointing as people were willing to become involved in a new project which would create jobs in a community suffering from high unemployment. ACC Bank should have been to the fore in this regard, but it was slow to become involved.</P>

      <P>I am happy to accommodate the Deputy at the end of my contribution. Much has been said in this debate and the debate earlier <Col N="1077" /> this year about the history of ACC Bank. When we debated ACC Bank earlier this year I was struck by the loyalty which Deputies on all sides felt existed in rural areas towards it and noted the service which its branches have provided to rural communities over the years. However, there was also recognition that the bank, or at least its management, has not covered itself in glory. Proportionate to its size and the amount of lending in which it engaged, ACC Bank's DIRT liability was probably the highest of the banks which were caught up in that difficulty. The bank has also engaged in some adventurous lending in recent years, which has caused some difficulty. Deputy Naughten's questions are well put and demand a response because it is now clear that if successful litigation were taken in the Four Seasons case, the taxpayer would be the effective loser and the potential maximum exposure would not be insignificant. Even though the bank is now passing into the private sector, it is appropriate that we put these questions on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>When we debated the issue earlier this year, I was anxious to ensure that we would not have a fire sale. The bank has had a difficult few years and had it been sold earlier this year it would not have been sold at best value. Indeed, it is possible that we would have got a better price if we had waited longer. Efforts have been made by the board, management and staff of the bank during the past year or so to bring about a transformation. Industrial relations are now better then they were and serious efforts have been made by management and the new board to transform the bank. Had we waited longer we might have got a better price than 165 million, which is in the lower range of what might have been an acceptable price.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the parent, Rabobank, is a good one. There was always a likelihood, had the ACC been acquired by an Irish based bank, that it would have tried to engage in substantial rationalisation. It is reassuring to hear that this is not likely to happen and that the branch network is, more or less, guaranteed for the foreseeable future. I also welcome the fact that there will be no compulsory redundancies for the first 18 months at least. The deal is better than would have been the case had the merger of ACC and TSB gone ahead in early 2000.</P>
      <P>There has been a 97% level of support for the purchase by Rabobank from the bank staff. The staff will have been influenced by the generous ESOP which has been set up. I have expressed concern about the nature of these ESOPs in the past and I will not detain the House by repeating those concerns.</P>
      <P>We might have got more money for the bank if we had waited longer and there is an element of fire sale about this purchase. However, given the bank which is purchasing ACC, the nature of the match and the guarantees that have been given, I am persuaded that we should not oppose this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the takeover of the ACC Bank. The bank has a long history and tradition in the agricultural sector and its new parent bank has considerable experience in rural banking throughout the world. I also welcome the fact that the staff of the bank and its branch structure are to be retained. There was anxiety among the staff regarding the new structures, particularly as we approach the introduction of the euro on 1 January.</P>
      <P>I abhor the way in which the euro changeover is being handled by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank. Shopkeepers and traders are expected to exchange currencies while doing business at the same time. I hope this does not lead to chaos. Many retailers are in total confusion regarding the manner in which this is being handled. The State and the Central Bank should have set up <i>bureaux de change</i> to distribute the new currency. Traders are expected to exchange currencies during a holiday period at no extra gain. They are being asked to do what the Central Bank and the Government should have done.</P>
      <P>The change is to be brought about on the worst possible day of the year. I accept this is the only day it could have been done but a holiday period is not a good time. The matter has not been properly thought out. Fancy advertisements on the television featuring personalities, including the Minister for Finance, are all very well but ordinary shopkeepers are being asked to do this job for no fee. I was told by an official of the Central Bank that shopkeepers will be trading and making profit, but this is not a way to do business. Independent traders are not bankers and should not have been asked to carry the entire burden of the exchange on their shoulders. I disapprove of the way this matter has been handled.</P>

    <P>I would be happy to leave the Title as it is and withdraw the amendment if the Minister assured the House that the proposed third section of the Bill, which will deal with railway orders and will include the transference of the power to make those orders to the new agency, will not also include the transference of procurement powers so that if a line is built between Dublin and Navan, as is proposed, the new agency will not be operating and controlling it; it will simply be <Col N="1079" /> dealing with the railway order that will be required and planning or licensing procedures. Can the Minister assure me that the new agency will be dealing with Luas and with the new metro alone and that it will not be taking responsibility for the new heavy rail lines from the airport or from Navan to Dublin?</P>

I can assure the Deputy that section 3, which is to do with the making of railway orders, deals with heavy rail. The usual procedure for heavy rail is to go through the procedure and get a railway order made. There will be no procurement of heavy rail from the railway procurement agency.

This amendment would have the effect of incorporating the agency into Córas Iompair Éireann and having one railway procurement agency rather than two, which would be sensible wherever its location. The decision is to have two, one for heavy rail and one for the new type of railway being proposed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;b) to monitor and publish regular reports on the safety of railway infrastructure generally;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated strongly in her speech in the Seanad and her remarks to us on Committee Stage that, given that there was a delay, she would consider giving a temporary safety remit to the new agency, less than the Minister had been hoping for, in publishing and introducing the new, comprehensive Railway Safety Bill. I understand that the Bill has passed the Cabinet and will be published soon. However, there will be a gap between what we are doing now and the passing and implementation of that Bill. The Minister said in the Seanad that she might accept a temporary safety remit for the new agency. She has an opportunity to do this now.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;light railway and metro infrastructure;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I did consider it very carefully. The Railway Safety Bill is going to Cabinet on Tuesday and will be printed in the following two to three days. Deputy Stagg sought to give the railway procurement agency a role in monitoring and reporting on rail safety. I am partial to accepting this amendment, even though it is to be hoped that the Railway Safety Bill will be law before Luas begins to run, and I did give a commitment about it in the Seanad. It is an interesting idea. Even as the line is being developed there will be safety matters to report on. The underlying intention is a good one and I am accepting it. However, the amendment must be changed so that it refers to light railway and metro. It is recommended here that I do not accept this amendment, but in true Civil Service fashion there is an alternative wording, &ldquo;to monitor and publish regular reports on the safety of light railway and metro infrastructure;&rdquo;. That is important because the tracks are the infrastructure. That is the amended amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This was discussed in detail on Committee Stage and the thrust of the amendment was discussed here on Second Stage. It is an effort to allow Members of this House access to information, by way of parliamentary questions, about an agency that will be independent but will, at the same time, be responsible for a considerable amount of <Col N="1081" /> public moneys.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from all sides of the House have expressed the opinion that if a State agency is to be set up, although it may be independent, it should be accountable here even if it is only a question of information being available to Members. We represent the public, members of which ask us to find out information on their behalf, but when we ask questions in the Dáil about an agency that spends a considerable amount of State money and is in charge of a considerable amount of resources, quite often we are told that the Minister has no responsibility in the matter and that it is an independent agency. There is a fundamental problem for democracy there.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister should be responsible for the day to day operation of the number nine bus and the reason it was five minutes late. We must find a middle ground here. The Minister did acknowledge that she would consider this after Committee Stage. Everybody wants something like this to happen. I know there is some work being done by the Whips but I am not sure whether this will entail legislation. If the Whips were to introduce proposals to the House, legislation would be required to give it this kind of impact. I am not sure whether this is promised or what the timescale would be. In this regard there is an opportunity to put into this legislation a requirement that information be made available to Members, and thence to the general public, through parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>The Minister may suggest taking the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; out of the amendment as she had a problem with it on Committee Stage. However, the matter should be considered and I am anxious for the Minister to look favourably on the thrust of this amendment. I would be willing to remove the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; if that would be of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very good debate on this and the Minister was favourably inclined towards it. In fact I thought she might have tabled an amendment to take account of it. We deal regularly with the setting up of various quangos and moving the authority out of this Chamber to the quangos. I am worried about that and I believe every Member of the House is worried about how this issue can be redressed. The committee dealing with Dáil reform will be making proposals containing something along the lines of what is being proposed here. Their intention is that the <Col N="1082" /> quangos within the Minister's remit, for which she does not have day to day responsibility, will have information collected from them. The Minister will give account of them to the Dáil as required by parliamentary question so that there is not a whole new block of public interest areas that cannot be raised in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This Minister has been excellent in that regard. She has taken questions and not sought to have them refused. Under existing rules many of the questions the Minister has taken could have been refused. That is personal to the Minister and her practice should be put into legislative form, and the amendments that we have before us would do that. The Minister was favourably disposed to it.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the House getting whatever information it requires to do its business. I fail to understand why I get an answer stating that as it is a day to day matter it has nothing to do with me. If it can be done I seek with my officials to have the question answered. Deputy Séamus Brennan has assured me that the Whips are looking at proposals which will render Ministers more accountable in respect of answering questions in the House.</P>
      <P>That will apply to all parties because Governments change and at some point Members from Opposition benches will be here giving answers. I will not accept this amendment but I have informed Deputy Séamus Brennan, as Government Chief Whip, that when these proposals come forward I am in favour of accepting them. The Railway Procurement Agency will then go into the remit of those changed proposals.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the thrust of these proposals, which we have not seen, will be to make Ministers more accountable, but I am concerned with making agencies more accountable. Deputy Stagg is right in saying that decision making power is moving out of the House. We are not able to get information and people are frustrated because of it. Some of these agencies are responsible for hundreds of millions of pounds but we cannot get information on them. There is something drastically wrong with such a system.</P>
      <P>These agencies come before committees but that is for nothing more than a nice cosy chat once a year. Even at committees it can be difficult to elicit information, whereas the information can be obtained by means of parliamentary question and if one is not happy then a supplementary question can be asked. I am disappointed that the Minister has not lived up to what she said she believes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> Many Deputies, including those on the Minister's side of the House, were very strong in their support for this &ndash; Deputy Callelly was one of those who argued in its favour. There seems to be cross-party support for this provision. Even if the Minister was to take out the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; to make information available on the finances, then Members could table questions on the agencies' finances. On Committee Stage the Minister acknowledged that she might look favourably on that because it is happening anyway through annual reports and so on.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the agency to account to a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. It is not a case of a cosy chat once a year and if that is what happens it is a reflection on the committee members. It is up to the committee to be probing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, until the first appointment to the Agency of a person consequent to an election having been held to which <i>subsection (3)</i> relates, the Agency shall consist of 7 members.</P>

      <P>In page 14, lines 34 to 36, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;, in&rdquo; in line 34 down to and including &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; in line 36 and substitute &ldquo;comply with the requirement that at least 3 members shall be women and at least 3 shall be men&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reality is that women do not achieve the level of representation at higher levels in society that is desirable and would be required by their numbers. Achieving that desirable level is Government policy, and there have been a series of attempts by the Government to discriminate positively towards women to ensure they achieve fair representation at all levels. One of the things the Government can do is ensure that a certain number of women are appointed to State boards. In this case the application of Government policy would mean the board would comprise at least three women and at least three men. The Minister has said she will appoint the best people, whether they all be men or women. However, that does not comply with Government policy which provides that she should seek to achieve this minimum level of representation.</P>
      <P>There are enough women among the best candidates for appointment but there is a bias against them and they should be promoted in the way I suggest. It is in accord with the policy of successive Governments. The Minister need not tell me that Niamh Bhreathnach said that because women should have been appointed to certain school boards the boards were not appointed. If that is the case it is because the men refused to find women qualified for the position.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there should be equal representation of both men and women as far as possible but I am not sure if it can be provided for in legislation. In the debate in the Seanad the Minister said she wanted the members of the board to be selected on merit. There are at least three good women who could sit on this board. It is a matter of advertising for them and persuading them to be appointed. I am not sure how the Minister's interim board is constituted and if it will pose a difficulty when appointing the board.</P>

      <P>I recognise the spirit of Deputy Stagg's amendment. I have appointed two good women to the interim board and it is my intention to appoint them to the board when the Bill is passed. I believe the best people should be appointed to boards. This is a small board and from my meeting with the interim board it appears the women members will have much to say and do. I cannot accept the amendment because it requires me to appoint three men and three women to the board. That goes against my beliefs, which is that the best qualified people for the job should be appointed, irrespective of their gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> When I started in local politics a long time ago Aileen Mallon and myself were the only two women members of Westmeath County Council. Now there is only one woman member. I never felt I was in a minority; my view was that I should get on with the job. Developments in the gender composition of boards should happen naturally, there should be no compulsion.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe in the role of women. Their approach is different and they have much to give to debates and decision making. The two women members of the interim board are equal in all respects to their male colleagues. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

I knew many of them, not as Fianna Fáil Party members but as fine people. The document was a recognition by the Minster and her party of the need for positive discrimination.</P>
      <P>These developments do not occur naturally and there is a need for intervention to ensure that the imbalance is corrected. There is a serious imbalance in the representation of women at senior level on these boards. The number has stagnated at 30 since the Minister took office. The amendment proposes positive discrimination to right a wrong and an imbalance. I ask the Minister, as former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party's women's group, to ensure it is corrected.</P>

      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 43 and 45 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The chief executive officer shall manage and control generally the staff, administration and business of the Agency and perform such other functions as may be conferred on him or her by or under the Act or determined by the Agency. He or she shall advise the Agency in relation to the performance of the functions of the Agency and shall make any proper proposals to the Agency on any matter relating to the activities of the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this and subsequent amendments is to attempt to better define the description of the role of the chief executive, who is central to the work of any organisation. It is important to have the role clearly defined in the legislation. In page 15, lines 43 to 45 outline generally the work of the chief executive. I am trying to expand on that and develop it a little further, as has been done in most other legislation I have looked at. What I am proposing is that while he or she &ldquo;shall manage and control generally the staff, administration and business of the Agency . . .&rdquo; and so on, he or she shall also &ldquo;advise the Agency in relation to the performance of the functions of the Agency and shall make any proper proposals to the Agency on any matter . . .&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar in intention to the one we discussed previously. It serves to expand the role of the chief executive and to put that into the actual Bill. The chief executive is the main person, as it were, in any State body and it is <Col N="1088" /> important that there should be clarity in the performance of the chief executive's duties in the legislation so that there would not be any conflict afterwards between the chief executive and the board. That has happened from time to time, as the Minister knows, on many State boards. When we are drafting legislation, we should make it very clear where the lines of demarcation are and where the responsibilities lie as between the chief executive and the board. That is why these two amendments are put forward.</P>

      <P>When I read this Bill, I considered that there was a gap in that there was no provision for somebody to take over the role of the chief executive in the event of he or she being suspended for any reason or being ill or being otherwise unable to perform the duties of the position &ndash; except, perhaps, by actually dismissing the chief executive. I believe it is standard in other legislation to make provision for the chief executive's work to be undertaken by somebody on a temporary basis if the need should arise. I notice the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is again included in my amendment and the Minister may wish to have it deleted. The amendment also has the effect of allowing the chief executive to delegate responsibility if he or she wishes.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4) The functions of the chief executive may be performed in his or her absence or when the position of chief executive is vacant by such member of the staff of the Agency as may from <Col N="1089" /> time to time be designated for that purpose by the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is a slight difference between the two amendments. Amendment No. 15 allows the chief executive, for the duration of his or her absence for a week or two, to personally delegate to the second in line, or whoever, in the staff of the agency. That does not appear to be provided for elsewhere in the Bill. Amendment No. 16 is slightly different in that it comes into play when the chief executive is, perhaps, sick or on holidays or has to be suspended for some reason &ndash; perhaps if there was an inquiry in progress. There is a subtle difference between the two amendments and perhaps the Minister would look at them again. The first gives the chief executive the authority to delegate; the second provides for a temporary replacement for the chief executive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that chief executives are permitted to be members of agencies, particularly the agency in question, and boards thereof. In the area of education, with which the Minister and I are both familiar, the principals of schools are not members of boards of management. There is a danger that, if he or she is a member of a board, a chief executive could dominate that board. The chief executive will be a full-time employee and it would be better if he or she reports to the board of the agency, is responsible to it but is not a member of it. There would, as a result, be clearer lines of responsibility and clear lines of demarcation between the role of the chief executive and that of the board. The amendment suggests that the chief executive may act as secretary to the <Col N="1091" /> board, attend its meetings, etc., but may not take part in making decisions which would impact on his or her role within the agency.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to this matter because difficulties have arisen in respect of a number of State boards. This amendment represents one way of addressing such difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Each consultant and each member of the staff of the Agency at a grade or level specified in <i>section 28(2)</i> shall not, for a period of twelve months following his or her resignation, removal or retirement from office, hold any office or employment or act as consultant where he or she may be likely to use or disclose information acquired by him or her in the exercise of the functions of the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a tricky issue. I apologise for not being present for the Committee Stage debate but I had to be away.</P>
      <P>The amendment attempts to highlight that in recent years many members of staff &ndash; the term &ldquo;consultant&rdquo;, which might be more problematic, is also included in the text &ndash; of State bodies and agencies, planning boards, etc., have been invited to leave their positions and take up employment in the private sector. I accept it is their right to do so, but when they leave they take with them a wealth of information and contacts. A great deal of the information they possess might be confidential in nature and is tantamount to being inside information. If these people go to work for a developer or private operator, they bring with them the information to which I refer which, in a way, places their new employer at an advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other companies that might be tendering for contracts, etc. We must take account of that when drafting legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if the amendment can work in practice, but it refers to a matter which is the cause of great concern, particularly as it relates to the planning process. We are establishing quite a powerful agency and it is possible that senior members of its staff could be invited to leave and become consultants to or employees of private sector companies. I am not sure how this matter can be addressed but I am of the opinion that the type of occurrences to which I refer give rise to certain difficulties. I am interested in hearing the <Col N="1092" /> Minister's comments on the amendment and discovering whether she recognises that the difficulties to which I refer occur from time to time. Senior officials working in the State and semi-State areas are often lured away from their jobs which can be to the detriment of local authorities and semi-State boards. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that matter and on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We discussed this matter at length on Committee Stage in Deputy Stanton's unavoidable absence, when his party colleague pressed the amendment strongly. We discussed situations which had arisen, particularly those that came to light during the mini-CTC inquiry which is in abeyance at present, where senior members of staff who negotiated deals with contractors were, the next day, on the opposite side of the table acting on behalf of those with whom they had negotiated in the first instance. The amendment is designed to ensure this does not arise. This matter must be addressed. I accept the Bill deals to a degree with declarations of interest. However, the transfer of people from the public to the private sector must be addressed. There is precedent for this in other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23(7) states that &ldquo;A chief executive of the Agency shall not, for a period of 12 months following his or her resignation, removal or retirement from office, hold any office or employment or act as consultant where he or she may be likely to use or disclose information acquired by him or her in the exercise of the functions of the Agency.&rdquo;, and, therefore, the chief executive is covered in this regard. On Committee Stage I stated that I would consult the parliamentary counsel about this matter. He had previously informed us that matters of labour law are better dealt with within contracts of employment or service than in legislation. Everyone agreed that a consultant could not be prevented from taking up another commission or job if he or she had already being doing a similar job.</P>
      <P>All Members were concerned about what emerged at the mini-CTC inquiry, namely, that four members of staff of a public sector company moved into the private sector. However, the individuals strongly asserted that they had done nothing wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies recommends that the board of a State body should, in a manner most effective to such body, deal with the issue, post resignation, retirement, employment, appointment and-or consultancy, of entry of its directors and employees into the private sector and should ensure that any procedures it may have put in place in this regard are monitored and enforced. This revised code was issued approximately two months ago and is quite strong in its intent. The advice we obtained from the parliamentary counsel is that, with the exception of catering for chief <Col N="1093" /> executives, this matter should not be dealt with in legislation and that the code of practice should be adopted, obeyed and monitored by the railway procurement agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply, which makes a certain amount of sense. I am glad she acknowledges the difficulties that have arisen in this area in the past. The chief executive is precluded from taking up office or employment for a further 12 months following his or her departure from the agency. However, the person down the ladder from the chief executive may also have knowledge of the inner workings of the agency. I urge the Minister to ensure that the agency, when in place, introduces codes of practice and contracts of employment to ensure such knowledge is not abused. I am not suggesting it will but people could be tempted by way of an offer they could not refuse. Such a person could leave the agency and work for the betterment of a company in the private sector. This is a big issue and it is happening more and more. The Minister said the only way to deal with it is through employment law. Can we do that or does a constitutional problem arise?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The chief executive, a member of the Agency, a member of the staff of the Agency, or a consultant, adviser or other person engaged by the Agency shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) notify the Agency of a potential conflict of interest or circumstance inwhich the person has a doubt about a conflict of interest, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) desist from pursuing an interest that they know to be in conflict with the work of the Agency.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> This amendment deals with conflicts of interest. I acknowledge the Bill provides for the disclosure of information by a person with a material interest. We must look a little further at this issue. A person may have a negative interest in something. Work which the agency proposes to carry out may impact in a negative way on a person or his or her property etc. My amendment seeks to place an onus on the staff of the agency to notify it of any conflict of interest. A person must not carry out work in which he or she has an interest if that interest conflicts with the agency. Such a provision, which is contained in other legislation, adds to the Bill. The inclusion of such a provision would fill this gap in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no gap. This matter is extensively dealt with in section 28(1) and (2) whereby the chief executive, consultant, staff and each member of the agency is required to make a declaration of interests. Section 29 states:</P>
      <P>where such a person has a pecuniary interest or other beneficial interest in, or material to, any matter which falls to be considered by the agency he or she shall&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) disclose to the agency the nature of hisor her interest in advance of any consideration of the matter,</P>
      <P>The provisions already contained in the Bill are stronger than those which Deputy Stanton seeks to insert.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) neither influence nor seek to influence a decision in relation to the matter,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) take no part in any consideration of the matter,</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) if he or she is the chief executive, a member of the Agency, or a member of the staff of the Agency, withdraw from the meeting . . .</P>
      <P>Sections 28 and 29 are very particular on this issue. Section 29(4) provides a mechanism for establishing whether someone has a conflict of interest which obviates the need for part (<i>a</i>) of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>Far from the Bill not containing any reference to this matter, it contains approximately three or four pages on it. The provisions laid down in the Bill are stronger than those tabled in Deputy Stanton's amendment and are far-reaching and precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledged that the Bill contains strong provisions in this area. I am simply making the point that they merely seek to deal with a person's positive interest &ndash; I think the word &ldquo;pecuniary&rdquo; was used. My amendment seeks to deal with a person's negative interest in the matter. It places on onus on such a person to cease pursuing an interest which is in conflict with the work of the agency.</P>

      <P>When I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister made the argument that it is the Department of Finance and not she who deals with such matters. There is nothing laid down in legislation to suggest that the Department of Finance deals with such matters; it is merely an administrative arrangement between Departments. It is nothing more or less than that.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for accepting on Committee Stage the idea of a worker director. From my research, she is the first Minister in this Government to create a worker director. No other worker director has been created though many have been done away with. The Minister should take her courage in her hands &ndash; we have the authority between us in this House&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be very partial to the agency coming under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act but the Department of Finance, which governs all our dealings, is the lead Department regarding that Act. That Department makes the amendments to the First Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act &ndash; that provision was enshrined in the Act when introduced by Eithne Fitzgerald &ndash; to allow for the inclusion of the Railway Procurement Agency for the purposes of this Act. As I said on Committee Stage we will liaise immediately the Bill becomes an Act, with the Department of Finance and insist it moves straight away to bring it under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>Section 37 states that the agency, CIE or any other person with the consent of the agency may apply to the Minister for a railway order. It strikes me that of all the bodies mentioned, CIE would have at its disposal a great deal of information pertaining to the making of railway orders and would be at an advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other body that might wish to apply for one. It is important in order to level the playing field that this information be available. I note the ESB was required to make information available during electricity deregulation whereby different bodies had to apply for licences in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason. In relation to the contract for the supply and installation of audio-video recording equipment for the Garda Síochána, this contract was awarded on the basis of an invitation to tender which was made available to interested parties by the Garda authorities. That document specifically stated that the contract would be awarded from the qualifying tenders on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, applying seven award criteria which were listed in order of priority. Given the specialised requirements of the equipment involved, the first award criterion was technical merit. The second criterion was the cost of providing the relevant systems and further criteria were concerned with matters such as the extent of compliance with the invitation to tender and the ability to meet installation time scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a detailed procurement process, which included publication of a tender notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities, two tendering parties were found to have submitted qualifying tenders. Those tenders, and samples of the equipment offered, were evaluated by a team of Garda technical experts with reference to the award criteria in the invitation to tender. The overall conclusion of the experts was that, having regard to the award criteria I have mentioned, the most economically advantageous tender had been submitted by SKS Ltd. at a cost of approximately £3.5 million, including VAT. The other qualified tenderer had <Col N="1098" /> submitted a lower cost tender but was considered by the experts to be less satisfactory from the point of view of technical merit and other award criteria to be taken into account in determining the most economically advantageous tender.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the other price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information with me. The £3.5 million tender won the contract. A report outlining the conclusions of the Garda experts with regard to each of the award criteria was forwarded by the Garda authorities to my Department. Having examined the report in detail, my Department applied, in compliance with national procurement procedures, to the Government contracts committee for approval to award the contract in accordance with the recommendation of the Garda evaluation team. For the purpose of the application, the committee was provided with the relevant background information and the financial details of the qualifying tenders. Following approval of the application by the Government contracts committee, the contract was awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the award of the contract, the unsuccessful qualifying tenderer raised a series of questions in connection with the procurement process undertaken in the matter. On foot of these queries, reports were sought and obtained by my Department from the Garda authorities, in particular in relation to specific aspects of the evaluation exercise carried out by the Garda experts. Having received the relevant reports from the Garda authorities, my Department carried out a comprehensive review of the procedures leading to the award of the contract and it concluded that the process had operated in accordance with procurement requirements and had not favoured any particular supplier. In addition, a significant amount of information was made available by my Department to the unsuccessful qualifying tenderer in the course of correspondence.</P>
      <P>The unsuccessful qualifying tenderer has also requested the Ombudsman to examine complaints about the way in which its correspondence has been dealt with by my Department. However, the Ombudsman is not reviewing the procedures which resulted in the award of the contract. A report on the relevant aspects has been provided by the Department to the Office of the Ombudsman and I understand examination of the matter is continuing in that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn to the other part of the question that refers to the report on the value for money examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The events that preceded the report on the value for money examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General on purchasing tyres by the Garda Síochána are now well known, but for the benefit of the House I will again set them out. A newspaper article, published on Sunday, 11 February 2001, alleged that members of <Col N="1099" /> the Garda Síochána and a civilian employee at Garda headquarters had participated in trips abroad paid for by a company which supplies tyres and related services to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As soon as I became aware of the allegations, I took immediate action. On 13 February 2001, I advised the Dáil that the Garda Commissioner had asked a chief superintendent to look at the allegations. I also stated that I was of the view that the matter warranted an external examination and that the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote, had instructed the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter. I also said the Secretary General of my Department had been in discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General about arranging an independent examination of the matter from a financial control point of view.</P>
    <P>The Public Services Commission also wrote to my Department on 13 February 2001 making certain inquiries related to this matter and the relevant information sought from the Department was forwarded to it. I understand the Public Services Commission also wrote to the Garda Commissioner about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a value for money examination on the purchase of tyres by the Garda Síochána which he completed and submitted to me. As soon as I received the report, I immediately arranged for copies of it to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. This was done on 21 November 2001. The Committee of Public Accounts will examine this report next month.</P>
    <P>The Government Supplies Agency which has responsibility for procuring a range of items for Departments and other agencies, including the Garda Síochána, also has a role to play in this matter. The tender competition for the supply of tyres was held by the agency. I understand the agency is investigating the supply of tyres for official vehicles with a view to ascertaining whether the conduct of particular contractors or suppliers breached conditions of contract. Discussions are currently taking place between my Department, the Government Supplies Agency and the Garda Síochána in relation to the holding of a new tender competition.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, there was an overpayment for the supply of tyres to the Garda Síochána. However, the full amount has yet to be determined. This matter is currently being investigated by the internal audit unit of the Department. As soon as the exact amount is known, all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the amount involved is recovered.</P>
    <P>The criminal investigation is also progressing. I am informed that a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 20 April 2001. I am also informed that on 3 August 2001 the DPP sought additional information and that a further file was submitted on 13 September 2001. <Col N="1100" /> The directions of the DPP in this matter are currently awaited.</P>
    <P>The internal audit unit in my Department has also raised certain queries with the Garda authorities concerning apparent irregularities that came to their notice in the course of the internal audit investigation. These irregularities are currently the subject of a separate criminal investigation by the Garda. This is at an advanced stage and it is expected that a file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions shortly.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has also taken action. He initiated a disciplinary investigation under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989. It was during the course of this investigation that certain matters that may be of a criminal nature came to light and a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, the Garda SMI programme of change has since 1998 been concerned with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Garda management. Arising from the Garda SMI a new finance directorate has been introduced, headed by a civilian accounting expert, to develop a new financial framework for the Garda Síochána. As part of a general review of Garda organisational arrangements, consultants have been asked, taking account of the recent difficulties in the transport section, to make recommendations to improve the situation. I expect to see the final report early next year. As an interim measure, the Commissioner directed that the processing, certification and payment of invoices from the company in question be transferred to the finance section at Garda headquarters. Deputy Howlin asked the value of the tender from the other tendering party. It was in the region of £2.71 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the lowest cost tender on the audio-visual equipment was less satisfactory from the point of view of technical merit. In view of that, who determined the technical requirements for the tender? Will the Minister tell the House the composition of the evaluation team? More particularly, will he indicate to the House whether Superintendent Geary was a part of the Garda evaluation team? AV Niche Ltd., which had the lowest tender, offered its audio-visual equipment for evaluation, and communicated by letter on 26 July 1999 with Superintendent Geary in Garda headquarters. The company received a reply from Mr. Harry Smith of SKS Communications Ltd. on 5 August 1999 asking for relevant catalogues, and asking for it to send a unit for evaluation in relation to the supply of interview recording systems to &ldquo;our police force.&rdquo; Is the Minister aware that Mr. Harry Smith and SKS Communications were ultimately the successful tenderers?</P>

    <P>Will the Minister explain to the House why the successful tenderer was involved directly by the Garda in seeking to obtain equipment from what, ultimately, was the competing tendering firm? Can the Minister explain why the company that engaged in the competitive tendering process <Col N="1101" /> with AV Niche was asked by the Garda Síochána to evaluate this equipment? What was the position of SKS in providing technical advice? Does the Minister accept that SKS had a serious conflict of interest in the manner in which it was brought into this by Superintendent Geary and the Garda?</P>

      <P>The companies are in the public domain. Will the Minister also explain why, when an inquiry was made to the Garda press office about this, that office said it had referred the original proposal from the lowest tenderer to the then Garda pilot scheme supplier, SKS Communications, which, it was felt, may have been in a position to best inform the Garda Síochána of current technical requirements? It appears that SKS advised the Garda about the technical requirements for the tender. SKS, in effect, set out what audio-visual equipment the Garda should acquire, with certain specifications. Those specifications happened, by coincidence, to fit exactly with equipment that SKS could supply at a price of £3.5 million, as opposed to AV Niche which could supply it for £2.7 million. Will the Minister refer all the papers relating to this matter for review by the Comptroller and Auditor General so that it is clear what happened? Will the Minister explain why a substantive response has not been sent to AV Niche in reply to its query about the reasons for its unsuccessful tender, when, under the EU directive governing public procurement tenders, there is an obligation on the State to supply information requested by the unsuccessful tenderer?</P>
      <P>The Minister is presiding over another major issue in which there is a suggestion of serious tendering and procurement irregularity. What has the Minister done to check into the matter in the context of advice he is getting from the Garda Síochána? Does he accept Garda advice or is he raising queries about that advice? This is a serious issue involving a substantial amount of public expenditure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter should be careful about making allegations in the House in relation to tendering procedures unless he can stand over them. As I understand it, the equipment sought by the Garda Síochána was required for the audio-video recording of interviews with suspects. The relevant equipment was of a specialist nature and one of the specifications was that the equipment should be capable of producing three simultaneous recordings in a manner that would safeguard the integrity of the recordings for evidence purposes. In the circumstances, it will be appreciated that the technical <Col N="1102" /> requirements were of the utmost importance and, accordingly, it was decided technical merit should be selected as the most important criteria for the award of the contract. The cost of the equipment was also taken into account and it was given the second highest weighting among the award criteria. The additional criteria and their weightings were chosen with reference to extensive Garda experience in dealing&mdash;</P>

The same article also stated that the Garda press office has clarified the circumstances in which this event took place.

Does he think it proper that the response that tenderer gets is from a competitor inviting the tenderer to submit their goods for valuation? Is the Minister happy with that procedure?</P>
      <P>The Minister commented that this matter has been clarified by the Garda press office. The press office says it referred the inquiry to the current Garda pilot scheme. It was felt that those running that scheme could best inform on the current technical requirements of the project. Is the Minister happy that a company wishing to tender for a multi-million pound project made direct contact with the Garda Síochána, and that it received a telephone call from a competitor inviting it to submit its goods for valuation? Is the Minister happy that the explanation from the Garda press office, which he seems to accept, is that the Garda were undertaking a pilot scheme, and that the Garda thought the company would be the best placed to give technical advice, despite being expected to compete for the tender? <i>Prima facie</i>, will the Minister not accept that is a woeful way of doing business?

      <Quest>the number of cases for Garda Síochána compensation awaiting determination in the courts; the number of gardaí who have made such claims; the year in which outstanding claims were first made; his views on whether the delay in processing such claims is acceptable; and the reforms he proposes to introduce to ensure such claims are processed and adjudicated upon within a reasonable period of time.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945, provide for a scheme of compensation for members of the Garda Síochána who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in relation to the performance of their duties as members of the Garda Síochána and to the dependants of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them. Under section 6 of the 1941 Act, a member of the Garda Síochána who has been maliciously injured may sue the State only by an authorisation issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Before deciding if an applicant should be authorised to apply to the High Court for compensation in respect of the injury, the practice has been for the Minister to consider all medical reports submitted by the applicant together with a report on the incident by the Garda Commissioner and a report on the injury by the chief medical officer of the Garda Síochána. Members are referred to the Garda chief medical officer as soon as a final medical report has been submitted by their solicitors.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,200 applications for compensation being processed under the Acts at present. Approximately 600 of these claims are at an early stage of processing in that various reports have yet to be furnished. The status of the remaining claims are: approximately 180 cases where the member has been examined by the Garda chief medical officer and the commissioner is preparing a report for submission to the Department; approximately 304 cases for which final medical reports have been received and for which applicants are awaiting examination by the Garda chief medical officer; approximately 120 cases for which the commissioner's reports, including the Garda chief medical officer's report have been provided and for which a ministerial decision as to the granting of an authorisation is required and 14 cases for which authorisations have recently issued to the applicant's solicitors. I have been advised by the Chief State Solicitor's Office that there are approximately 145 cases with them awaiting a High Court hearing.</P>
      <P>Since 1955, when the current system was introduced, more than 6,000 Garda compensation files have been opened in relation to the Acts. Unfortunately, records do not exist on claims made prior to 1955. The information sought as regards the year in which outstanding claims were made is not readily available and cannot be ascertained within the timeframe for answering this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A backlog of claims occurred a number of years ago due initially to two judicial review cases which changed the manner in which claims are processed and then because of the death of a Garda surgeon and the delay in replacing him with the Garda chief medical officer. The Garda <Col N="1106" /> chief medical officer is currently addressing the elimination of the backlog. To assist this process, sanction has been sought from the Department of Finance for additional medical assistance for the Garda chief medical officer.</P>
    <P>The operation of the compensation scheme under the Acts was last reviewed in 1997. That review resulted in a recommendation on the establishment of a compensation tribunal to deal with the less serious injuries. The Garda associations, although represented on the committee, have sought to have certain of the committee's recommendations amended. My officials will be meeting with representatives of the associations in the new year after which I propose to bring proposals to Government for consideration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, unavoidable delays can occur where necessary additional inquiries are required because of the seriousness of the injuries received and the circumstances of the incident. I agree that delays in processing applications for compensation should be avoided where possible and I have requested my officials to review the processes used with a view to streamlining and elimination of delays where possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that where a member of the Garda Síochána suffers serious injury or families suffer a bereavement as a result of a Garda suffering a fatality, there is a duty on the State to ensure compensation claims made properly by members of the Garda Síochána are processed with some reasonable degree of speed? Will he accept the current system is not working and that the delays in processing compensation claims are outrageous and indefensible? Will he acknowledge that during his term in office, he has taken no meaningful steps to address this issue? Will he indicate why there are no readily available statistics and information in his Department which would facilitate him in advising the House of the number of years for which different claims await to be addressed?</P>
      <P>Of the 600 claims at an early stage, will the Minister indicate how many of those 600 were filed by the end of last year? In relation to the remaining 600 cases and the breakdown the Minister has given the House, will he indicate how many of those claims back date two, three, four and five years? What new arrangements does the Minister intend to put in place, if any, to allow the enormous backlog of claims which have accumulated to be properly processed through his Department and by the Garda Síochána? Does the Minister agree that, even in the context of the 145 cases apparently awaiting hearing in the High Court, they could be waiting two to three years before being disposed of, based on the speed currently applicable to processing these claims?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that I am not satisfied with the manner in which these claims are being dealt with from a time perspective. I have also stated that there was a report which was furnished back in 1997 and <Col N="1107" /> which made various recommendations. Those recommendations included the setting up of a Garda Síochána Personal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which would operate along the same lines as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, the difference being that gardaí would be compensated for pain and suffering.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors will take place in the new year to try to reach agreement on the matter. Every effort will be made to try to reach agreement because I realise how important this can be. It is true that we had difficulty recruiting additional assistance. However, I can happily say that the Garda authorities have identified a doctor who is willing to assist the chief medical officer in processing the compensation cases. The schedule of fees is a difficulty. The doctor in question has indicated that he is prepared to consider a fee of a certain amount. That proposal has to be considered by the Department of Finance. There is, however, a long gap between what the doctor seeks and what the Irish Society of Occupational Medicine has on its books as a fee for an hourly session.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the system, as it now applies, is not operating in an efficient manner? It is a major scandal that members of the Garda Síochána may have to wait years to receive compensation in circumstances in which it is proper that it be paid. Will the Minister ensure the information I have requested in my question, which his Department clearly does not have available to it because it has given no priority or shown no real concern in respect of this issue, and which the Minister says he does not have to hand, is furnished to me and other Members of the House immediately prior to or after the Christmas recess?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the workload of the Forensic Science Laboratory has been on the increase in recent years. The Government's approach to dealing with the inter-linked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage, and Garda operations such as Dóchas and Cleanstreet, has resulted in significant drug seizures and continues to prove effective in targeting on-street drug dealing. Over the last three years, from 1998 to 2000, illicit drugs with an estimated street value of £140 million, or 177.8 million, were seized.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory that, up until 2001, records were not maintained by the laboratory which recorded cannabis cases separate from other drugs cases. In this regard the director informs me that of the 8,053 drug seizure cases submitted to the laboratory in 1999, 6,847 cases have been processed, leaving a total of 1,206 cases awaiting examination. Of the 8,678 drug seizure cases submitted to the laboratory in 2000, 7,109 cases have been processed, leaving a total of 1,569 cases awaiting examination. This year, up to 7 December, 6,193 cases were submitted for cannabis testing. Of these cases, 1,898 have been pro<Col N="1109" /> cessed, leaving a total of 4,295 awaiting examination.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government has no plans to change the law in relation to cannabis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that out of 6,193 cases of cannabis found in the possession of individuals during 2001, 4,295 samples remain to be tested by the Forensic Science Laboratory? With regard to cannabis seizures, to which section 3 of the Drugs Act applies, is it true that over two thirds of the seizures of cannabis submitted to the Forensic Science Laboratory are not being tested? Is the Minister aware that the drugs section in the laboratory, due to the pressure it is under, does not process section 3 cannabis cases unless requested specifically by the Garda to do so or by a judge as a result of a court application? Is he aware that it is now widely known on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other urban centres that if cannabis is found in one's possession by the Garda, there is a very reasonable chance that no proceedings will ever be brought because it will not be tested in the Forensic Science Laboratory? Will the Minister indicate whether he has inquired of the laboratory when the 4,295 samples currently in the laboratory will be analysed and if he is aware that the delay in analysing such samples may result in the possibility of a prosecution being time-barred? The Minister, either by gross incompetence or by stealth, is effectively, in practice as opposed to by legislation, changing the law relating to the street use of cannabis.</P>

      <P>I offer my condolences to the family on the death of their infant son in such tragic circumstances. The death of an infant child is always a tragedy and it is all the more poignant that it should occur in such tragic circumstances as happened in this case. All accommodation providers and companies managing State owned properties are required under contract, generically approved by the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that all accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and State agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.</P>
      <P>In relation to the needs of babies, children and expectant mothers, rigorous contractual requirements are imposed on accommodation providers. In this regard, proprietors and operators of all accommodation centres where asylum seekers with children are accommodated are required to have reasonable regard to the needs of young children. All of the contractual obligations were met by the proprietor in this instance. A cot was provided in the <i>en suite</i> room, the size of which was appropriate to the family and met the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966. In addition, the room contained a television unit, similar to that provided in many hotels. In common with units of this nature, it was designed so that facilities for making tea or coffee could be placed on it. Parents of young children in the centre are discouraged from using kettles or other electrical cooking appliances in their rooms because of safety risks. Although no electrical cooking appliance or kettle was provided by the hotel in the bedroom in question, a dedicated area of the hotel was available 24 hours a day to enable light snacks and food for infants to be prepared. The facilities available included fridges, kettles, sterilizers, microwave ovens, cutlery and crockery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that an infant lost his life as a result of this tragic accident. I regret the outcome of the incident, as do staff members in the hotel. It would be wrong to imply that the cause of the dreadful accident could be attributed to inadequacy in the accommodation provided. On receipt of the report of the boy's death, a senior officer from the Reception and Integration Agency travelled to Cork to meet his family and to provide assistance. On arrival, he met the fam<Col N="1115" /> ily to offer condolences on behalf of the agency and put in place arrangements with the family, the Southern Health Board and the Garda for the child's funeral in accordance with the requirements of the Muslim faith.</P>

      <P>I begin my expressing condolences to the family of the dead child, on my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party. The loss of an infant child is a dreadful tragedy.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, notwithstanding the requirements that have to be met by providers of accommodation for asylum seekers as indicated in his reply, that the standards are met in every case? Can the Minister give such an assurance? What actions have been taken since the tragedy to review accommodation currently being provided and to ensure a diminished likelihood of such a tragedy happening again? Is it inappropriate to make available a food warming facility in the room in which infants are staying? Is it unreasonable to suggest that an infant of six or seven months requires food at all times and that asylum seekers, therefore, should have access to appropriate equipment to facilitate this? Is the Minister satisfied that direct provision is the best way to provide for asylum seekers? Does he propose to revisit the issue of direct provision? Can he confirm that the allowance to asylum seekers is the only State benefit not to have been increased in recent times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to their use, properties proposed for providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers are inspected by officials from the Reception and Integration Agency to ascertain their suitability. If a property is deemed suitable following such an inspection, a comprehensive memorandum of agreement is entered into by the proprietor and the agency. Such a memorandum is agreed between the agency and a management company in the case of State-owned properties. Under the terms of these agreements, proprietors and management companies are required to ensure that premises comply and operate in accordance with statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies. Such requirements may relate to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspectorate unit of the RIA conducts regular unannounced inspections of each location where asylum seekers are accommodated. Since the system of dispersal and direct provision was introduced in April 2000, at least two full-day inspections have been carried out on each property. Additional unannounced short inspections are carried out on an ongoing basis. Diminution in standards which come to light as a result of such inspections are treated very seriously by the agency and can lead to termination of contracts, if warranted. The RIA is extremely careful about the accommodation it provides and is keen to <Col N="1116" /> ensure standards are kept to the highest level. It is unfortunate that a kettle was kept in the room in the case referred to by the Deputy. A communal area was available for boiling water and it was intended that asylum seekers would use such facilities.</P>
    <P>Direct provision has led to the settlement of more than 4,500 people throughout the country. This has been done sensitively, efficiently and successfully. It has been suggested that allowances for asylum seekers should be increased from £15 per week. Those in direct provision with children qualify for child benefit just as citizens of this country do and will therefore benefit from budgetary increases. Direct provision is the best method of housing asylum seekers as there is not a large surplus of accommodation. It would be extremely difficult for asylum seekers to find accommodation if it were not for direct provision. Asylum seekers were sleeping on park benches before the introduction of direct provision and I do not wish to contemplate a return to such a scenario.</P>

      <P>While I share concern expressed over many years about deficiencies in prison health care services, I do not accept there is a crisis, as alleged in the Deputy's question. I presume he is referring to a paper recently published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. The findings in the paper are not new and were published by my Department in 2000. Given the nature of the prison population, with many prisoners coming from a background of severe drug abuse, the figures presented are unsurprising. The figure of 2% HIV prevalence among our prison population is less than for similar groups in the general community and less than that in other jurisdictions with a similar drug problem.</P>
      <P>Many decisive actions have been instigated to address deficiencies in prison health care services. I established a group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services in November 1999. The group's report, which contained recommendations to improve many aspects of prison health care services, was published recently and implementation of the recommendations will require considerable negotiation and dialogue with other interests. I have directed the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to pursue this matter urgently. Other general health care developments have included the recruitment of qualified nurses in prisons and the appointment of a co-ordinator of prison nursing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to tackle the long-standing problem of drug abuse in prisons and I approved an action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment <Col N="1117" /> in the prison system in 1999. The plan advocated a broad approach to increase treatment for prisoners addicted to drugs and recommended the expansion of detoxification facilities and drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The director of the Prisons Service, at my instigation, established a national steering group for prison-based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The group submitted its first report to me in July 2000, recommending the appointment of a drug treatment co-ordinator for the Dublin prisons, recruitment of drug treatment specialists in the counselling, psychological and medical fields and a training programme led by an assistant governor to enhance and make more professional prison officers involved in interpersonal work with drug treatment prisoners. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The implementation of the report's recommendations was approved in principle by Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be negotiated between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance, the Prisons Service and health boards. There has since been a series of meetings, resulting from which the recruitment process for the two key central positions identified in the report, assistant governor in charge of training and co-ordinator of drug treatment services (prisons), commenced in mid-2001. The assistant governor post was filled on 20 October 2001 and I understand efforts are being made to fill the post of co-ordinator as soon as possible, although it is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Following consultation with the Department of Finance and the Irish Prisons Service, my Department has commenced the recruitment process for the nursing, psychologist and probation and welfare service posts recommended in the steering group's report. Discussions are continuing with the health boards about filling positions in their areas, as identified in the report.</P>
    <P>The provision of methadone maintenance for new committal prisoners already on an approved community treatment course has been a key development in the past 18 months. On 25 November 2001, 261 prisoners were in receipt of methadone maintenance in the prison system and a further 57 were receiving methadone detoxification. Another important initiative has been the opening, in November 2000, of a designated drug free wing in St. Patrick's Institution with a capacity for 76 inmates. Building on this successful development, I have issued a direction to the Prisons Service to have a designated drug free area in all institutions under its control within a three year period. A designated drug free unit is due to open in Wheatfield Prison in the coming months and I announced recently that the new C Wing in Limerick Prison, with space for 78 pris<Col N="1118" /> oners will be designated as a drug free facility when it is inaugurated in 2003.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, does he accept the statement that drug abuse is rife in prisons? If so, what steps does he propose to take to deal with the problem? Does he accept that hepatitis and HIV are prevalent in prisons? Can the Minister tell the House if people with such infections contracted them outside of prisons, or if some of them contracted a virus in prison? What research has been conducted by the Department of Health and Children on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of technical and policy measures have been introduced in recent years to tackle the problem of drugs in prisons. A number of technical and policy measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling and use of illegal drugs in the prison system, including sophisticated video surveillance; improved visiting and search facilities, including facilities for strip-searching prisoners; increased vigilance by staff; and urine testing. Where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates the gardaí are called to the prison with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned. A number of such prosecutions take place each year and persons have served prison sentences in this respect.</P>
      <P>The study shows a 2% prevalence of HIV among the prison population which is less than for similar groups in the general community. I do not have the research to which Deputy Gay Mitchell referred, but unfortunately there is no vaccine to prevent against hepatitis C. It is health care policy to refer prisoners with hepatitis C to specialist hospital clinics to enable an assessment of their condition and the planning of appropriate treatment. Any treatment recommended by an external specialist would be facilitated by the prison service.</P>
      <P>We have sought to provide additional drug free places. We opened a new drug free unit at St. Patrick's Institution and we are trying to get to the stage within the prison system whereby the same treatment and facilities will be available to prisoners as to those outside the prison structure.</P>

      <P>I fully understand and readily sympathise with the distress which families must face when a loved one goes missing and I have spoken in the House on many occasions on this subject. The provision of services or support facilities to the families of missing persons is not a function that would normally fall within the remit of my Department. However, in deference to concerns expressed on this matter, I instructed my Department to examine the issue.</P>
      <P>While it is considered that the most appropriate way to provide these services is through the existing statutory services and the support of relevant voluntary organisations, it is accepted that the families of missing persons may need some single contact point where they will be offered relevant advice and support. Preliminary discussions have been held between my Department and two voluntary organisations about the establishment of such a service. It is envisaged that the service will provide a helpline offering advice, counselling and referral and will include structured liaison with the Garda. I am pleased to report that my Department has been allocated 70,000 in the recent budget to establish the helpline. It is anticipated that the helpline will be in operation in 2002 and will complement the range of services already being provided by the Garda to the families of missing persons.</P>

The remaining recommendations cover a wide range of areas which fall within the competence of a number of Departments and agencies, including my Department. Based on consultations with other Departments and agencies, work is continuing on developing an implementation plan in respect of those remaining recommendations. The consultation process is now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to submit proposals to Government in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a summary of the commission's recommendations which runs to many pages. The sum<Col N="1120" /> mary and the recommendations have been with the Minister for a long time.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of areas in which implementation of the recommendations has commenced. The House will be aware that the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings by Mr. Justice Barron is well advanced. The Department of Health and Children provided funding for counselling in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing. As recently as 22 May 2001 the Government approved the provision of up to £162,000 in the current year to the Justice for the Forgotten group in respect of a family support centre, with further support guaranteed for next year. These are the most tangible forms of implementation of the recommendations, but work is also under way in other areas. For example, a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme which was recommended by the report is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>The Department has also been engaged in high level consultations on the recommendations with other relevant Departments as recently as this week. As a result I will shortly be able to submit comprehensive proposals to Government regarding the remaining recommendations, including in particular those touching on the financial and other needs of victims. I am determined to bring this work to a conclusion as a matter of priority.</P>

Does he accept that a victims' pension should be established, as recommended by the commission? Does he accept that the stopping of pensions on remarriage should be eliminated regarding any public service pension payable to the spouses of those killed in the line of duty? I do not wish to read all of the recommendations into the record, but are they accepted? Are we talking about an implementation procedure or is the Minister going to accept, modify or reject some of the recommendations?</P>

    <P>Implementation of some of the recommendations has commenced and, in some cases, is well under way. I will shortly submit proposals to Government on the outstanding recommendations, including those regarding the financial and <Col N="1121" /> other needs of victims and their families.

      <Quest>when he expects to publish the promised disability Bill having regard to the commitment that it would be published in this Dáil session; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[32106/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy last asked me this question on Tuesday, 13 November 2001. At that time I informed her that it was the firm intention of the Government to publish the disability Bill before Christmas. This remains the case.</P>
      <P>The disability Bill is a positive action measure which will enhance and underpin the ability of people with disabilities to participate more fully in everyday life. The measures proposed to achieve these objectives clearly have cross-sectoral impact and have required a comprehensive, innovative and considered approach to be taken. Nonetheless, work has progressed rapidly and the Bill is being dealt with as a matter of priority at all levels to ensure that we meet our commitment to people with disabilities to publish a disability Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disability Bill will be the fourth piece of major legislation relating to disability equality to be introduced by this Government and has been <Col N="1122" /> progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructural framework for equality which the Government has put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000. prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including that of disability, in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. The Equality Authority and the office of the Director of Equality Investigations, established to implement this legislation, are now fully operational. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency dedicated to disability policy and practice, and is now fully operational.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, indicated in the House during the debate on the Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill, 2001, that the main focus of the Government's disability Bill will be on positive action measures to remove barriers and to support access and participation by people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to include a range of measure to ensure that all public services are made accessible to people with disabilities. For example, physical access to built facilities will be an integral part of this approach. Public transport is another area where barriers to people with disabilities need to be removed.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other issues under consideration in the context of the Bill which will cut across areas as diverse as personal health services, landlord and tenant obligations, public procurement procedures, use of genetic testing for commercial purposes, e-accessibility measures and measures to promote the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We stand on our record of delivering good enforceable law to protect people with disabilities. The Bill will be a catalyst for change that is equitable in law through measures that recognise the fact that many people with disabilities need support in accessing employment and good services. We want to move away from the historical deficits in this country that leave people with disabilities with no option but to go to court for individual rights, by establishing statute based standards for service delivery and access. The disability Bill will further reinforce the principles of disability equality and greatly consolidate the strides made by this Government in creating a full framework for their implementation. </P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in saying my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, has asked this question many times. Will the Minister accept that the commitment he gave her was to publish the Bill in this Dáil session? Will the Bill be published tomorrow, the last day of this session; if not, and if the promise is to be broken, has the Bill gone to Government; and if not, will it go to Government in the remaining Cabinet meeting scheduled for next week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We understand the Bill will be considered by the Cabinet next Tuesday. Will a complete and fully drafted Bill go to Cabinet? If Cabinet approves the Bill will it be available to the public before Christmas? The Bill needs to be available, not just to the Members of this House but also to the large number of groups who have an interest in this subject and who will wish to have as much time as possible to scrutinise it.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention that Second Stage be taken as soon as possible after the Christmas break? The timeframe will be tight. The general election must be called before the end of June and there will be a need for wide consultation. The select committee will wish to hear the views of several groups before Committee Stage of the Bill is debated. The Bill has been awaited for a long time, a wide variety of groups have an interest in it and it will deal with a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give some indication of the scope of what will be contained in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House a guarantee that Second Stage of the Bill will start immediately the Dáil reconvenes after the Christmas break and will he allow the time of the House to ensure the legislation is enacted in proper form before the Easter vacation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the progress which has been made in the life of this Dáil in relation to people with disabilities. The Employment Equality Act, the Equal Status Act and the National Disability Authority Act represent major milestones along the road to creating a more equitable society for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be approved and published before Christmas. That is the promise that was made and I intend to keep that promise. Unfortunately, I do not order Dáil business. It will be a matter for the Whips to decide when the legislation will be taken. It is certainly my hope that the legislation will be passed through both Houses and become law before the Dáil rises for the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In formulating the scope of the legislation there has been major consultation with various groups. Submissions have been taken and each proposal has been examined in meticulous detail by very dedicated officials within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The measures to be covered in the Bill will be proactive in nature and will require all Departments and State agencies to participate in initiatives to advance and underpin the inclusion of people with disabilities. In deciding the scope of the proposed Bill, we have been guided by the recommendations made <Col N="1124" /> by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and by consultations with people with disabilities. The recommendations of the commission with regard to anti-discrimination legislation have already been implemented.</P>
    <P>The Bill will support the principle of mainstreaming through positive action measures, including the removal of barriers. In this regard, consideration is given to barriers which currently exist in a range of areas, including the built environment, access to information, transport and health services. Consideration is also given to issues which cut across areas as diverse as landlord and tenant obligations, public procurement procedures, use of genetic testing for commercial purposes and measures to promote the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>This will be a very comprehensive piece of legislation and a flagship in the treatment of people with disabilities in our society for many decades to come. It will create the environment for the kind of equality to which we have always aspired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last several days have seen very disturbing developments in the Middle East. There has been appalling loss of life, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has sharpened and the hopes of restarting the peace process have suffered a major setback just at the moment when the promising initiative taken by US Secretary of State Colin Powell was getting under way. Suicide attacks killed around 30 Israeli civilians at the beginning of December. The Government has utterly condemned these dreadful attacks on innocent civilians. No cause can justify such atrocities and mass murder will not advance any cause. The Government has repeatedly emphasised its abhorrence at the killing and wounding of innocent civilians, Palestinians and Israelis.</P>
      <P>Unhappily, another brutal and horrific attack was carried out last night by Palestinian terrorists in which ten Israelis were shot dead. This is another slaughter of the innocent. It is totally unwarranted and marks a further very serious step towards chaos. However, this must be a time for cool heads to rule. The use of force, even in self-defence, must be measured. The gunmen and the bombers must not be allowed to take control of events. Once again, it is evident that political paralysis is the breeding ground for extreme violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have repeatedly said that the only way to end this dreadful conflict is to resume the peace process. There is no military solution and to rely on force is to give in to despair. Neither the terrorist attacks nor the Israeli response have achieved their objectives. Violence has not brought greater freedom for the Palestinian people. The response has not brought greater security for the Israeli people. In both cases, the result has been the opposite of what was intended. Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace. Agreement, if it is to come and if it is to last, must necessarily recognise both <Col N="1126" /> Israel's right to live in peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>I issued two statements last week. In the first I expressed the Government's horror at the killing of Israeli civilians and I extended sympathy to the injured and the bereaved, to the Government of Israel, and to all who suffered in these atrocities. I urged the Israeli Government to persist in the path of peace. I said that, while it was essential that those directly responsible should be brought to justice, it would serve only the cause of those who are opposed to peace to go beyond this legitimate requirement.</P>
    <P>I voiced the hope that the Israeli Government, even in this hour of great tragedy, would continue working to find a way to move forward and to bring an end to this conflict which had taken such a toll on human life. I also stressed the urgent need for the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to move quickly to renew security co-operation with the aim of ending the cycle of violence and to take all necessary steps to resume negotiations leading to a just, comprehensive and lasting solution. The statement also called upon the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to arrest and bring to justice the perpetrators of these awful acts and to prevent the repetition of such acts. Finally, I expressed the Government's grave concern at the Israeli helicopter attacks in the vicinity of President Arafat's headquarters. I called on Israel to desist from such attacks and to exercise the greatest restraint and prudence so as not to risk a further escalation of the conflict with unpredictable consequences.</P>
    <P>In a second statement. I expressed my deep concern and disappointment at the extent and severity of the Israeli retaliation against the Palestinian Authority. We do not agree with the Israeli description of the Palestinian Authority as an entity that supports terrorism. We do not see what other partner Israel can have in fighting the terrorists nor do we see how destroying the infrastructure of the Palestinian Authority and attacking its police stations and security forces can possibly help the Palestinian Authority to deal with the men of violence, as demanded by Israel. At the same time, these Israeli attacks, along with the continuing incursions into Palestinian territory, closure of Palestinian towns and settlement building undermine the domestic political support which President Arafat needs if he is to combat terrorism effectively. I wrote two letters to Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres extending the Government's sympathy and conveying our views on the situation. I also spoke to Shimon Peres on the telephone last Saturday and again person on Monday in Brussels both at the General Affairs Council and in a separate bilateral meeting.</P>
    <P>I also addressed the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on this matter on 4 December. Following its discussion, the select committee adopted a resolution deploring the escalating violence in the Middle East. The resolution also called on the Government to do all in its power to press for a resumption of peace talks directly, <Col N="1127" /> through the EU and the UN, and with other players. I am happy to assure the select committee that I am taking every opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The Middle East was one of the major topics discussed at the General Affairs Council. A statement was issued after the meeting which said that only determined and concerted action by the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and Russia could help the parties break the cycle of violence and re-engage on the path to peace. The statement went on to state that this requires:</P>
    <P>the re-affirmation and full recognition of Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders, and the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories.</P>
    <P>As a first step, the following commitments would have to be given by the Palestinian Authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects and a public appeal in Arabic for an end to the armed intifada. The Israeli Government commitments involve the withdrawal of its military forces and a stop to extra-judicial executions, the lifting of closures and of all restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people and a freeze on settlements.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this EU position and in light of the discussions the Council had on the same day in Brussels with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and with the Palestinian Minister for International Co-operation Nabil Shaath, the Council mandated Javier Solana, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to return to the Middle East and to report back to the Laeken European Council tomorrow. The aim is to help bring about a speedy resumption of negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, without preliminaries.</P>
    <P>The EU statement places an onus on both sides and they must act in tandem. Ireland sees President Arafat as the indispensable partner for dialogue. He alone has the stature among Palestinians to end violence and to negotiate a lasting peace with Israel. The alternative to President Arafat would be worse &ndash; either Hamas or a vacuum. No other Palestinian Authority leader has any possibility of winning popular support for a peace process. We agree that the Palestinian Authority should do more to bring the men of violence under control, but we recognise this is much easier said than done. President Arafat should not be faced with impossible demands, nor should he be made to feel isolated. It is neither realistic nor safe to expect President Arafat to go beyond a certain point without corresponding steps by the Israeli Government. Reliance simply on military coercion will not work in the longer term and, on the contrary, it makes President Arafat's task impossible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> It is for both sides to calm the situation and to de-escalate the conflict. The Palestinian Authority must demonstrate its commitment to facing down the men of violence. It must arrest those responsible for terrorist acts and keep them in custody. The sustained attacks by Israel on the PA, its security forces and its facilities are misguided and will have the opposite effect to the one intended. Furthermore, Israel's insistence on a seven day total ceasefire before implementing the Mitchell recommendations, or even discussing the political dimension with the Palestinians, is unrealistic and makes it practically impossible for President Arafat to carry out Israeli demands.</P>
    <P>Ireland is strongly in favour of a return to the negotiating table and we will do all we can, together with the other member states of the European Union to support a renewed peace process.</P>
    <P>We would also support constructive action in the United Nations Security Council. The usual practice in the Security Council is that initiatives on the question of Palestine are proposed by the non-aligned movement members. I understand the NAM held discussions in New York, but decided not to propose action in the Security Council at present. During Ireland's presidency of the Council in October, there was consideration of the Palestinian question and Ireland was authorised to make a statement to the press on 25 October. Further action was not possible in October due to the divergent views among Security Council members.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East as it stands is very discouraging. There is a solution, however, and it is a political one. The path to peace is clear. What is needed is the political will. I call on both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, to take the steps which they know are necessary. These steps are set out in the Mitchell report. The Government has warmly welcomed this report and fully endorsed its recommendations. These recommendations must be taken in their entirety, as there is no room for either side to select those measures which appeal to it and to avoid those which carry a cost. Furthermore, the measures have to be implemented within a close timeframe. They cannot be separated out in a phased sequence which moves forward one step at a time, with the implementation of each measure conditional upon completing other measures. The measures are mutually reinforcing and must be implemented as a package.</P>
    <P>I call on the Palestinian Authority to act firmly to stop all acts of violence and in particular to do all in its power to prevent the murderous and senseless suicide attacks. I call on the Israeli Government to cease its present military action against the Palestinian Authority and to set about rebuilding security and political partnership with the Palestinian Authority. These are the steps which both sides must take if there is to be any hope of escaping from this terrible conflict.</P>

      <P>Approaching Christmas 2001, it is clear the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has rarely been worse. The news today that the Israeli Government is to break off all ties with President Arafat and proposes to launch widespread military activities on the West Bank and Gaza can lead to only even greater disaster.</P>
      <P>Until recently it was possible to talk of the Middle East peace process but not at present. There is no longer a functioning peace process there, it is in bloody collapse. The problem for both sides is that when the peace process goes out the window it opens the door for extremist elements on both sides. The question arises as to whether we can contribute in any way.</P>
      <P>We have had our own history of conflict and from that perspective have some insights to offer regarding conflict resolution. If there is to be a resolution it has to be a political rather than a military one. We can also contribute by discussing the issue. It is important that we do not fall victim to the move to extremism and are as balanced as possible in our approach. We must attempt to see the situation from both sides and the language we use should be measured in tone. That should not in any way stop us from condemning matters where we consider condemnation is justified. To be quite blunt, there is much to condemn on both sides.</P>
      <P>This conflict has been going on for generations. I have always objected to the building of settlements by Israel in the past. It is contrary to UN Security Council resolutions and has always been a contributory factor to conflict. I seriously object to the march up the Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon prior to the last election. It was as inflammatory a symbolic act as one could devise. At this stage in the current intifada there have been some 1,000 deaths, most of them innocent victims and almost three-quarters of them Palestinian. The lines have become blurred between what passes as attack and retaliation. Both sides consider what has been done to them as an attack and likewise their response is considered retaliation. It is not for us to establish which definition applies.</P>
      <P>The rejection of the Palestinian Authority as a partner for peace by Israel is of major concern. The PA has problems not least with its own people and some are related to its inefficiency and corruption. It appears to have been largely rejected by its own people who now turn more to Hamas and the extremists for leadership. Ariel Sharon has made demands of Yasser Arafat to stop the intifada and the question is if he can do that. He cannot do it at present and I am not sure he ever could. He certainly could have made a better effort, but even when he recently attempted to have the spiritual leader arrested he was faced down by the people and it was clear he was powerless on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am critical of the lost opportunity by which he failed to further the peace process, if not reach a peaceful settlement during the Camp David talks. He is now in a mortally weak position but <Col N="1130" /> his weakness is compounded by the activities of the Israelis. I do not know their strategic aim. With whom do they suggest they might deal if he is not there? I agree with the Minister that the alternatives are almost certainly more extreme. I do not know what the Israelis are trying to achieve by undermining Yasser Arafat, knocking out his security installations, killing his policemen and then calling on him to deal with the extremists on the Palestinian side. That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that it is unfair to criticise and deal with Israel in the same way as the Palestinians. I expect a civilised nation to comply with international law. I also expect higher standards from an established nation. Israel is the dominant player in this conflict and it has questions to answer from the point of view of international law and compliance with UN resolutions. In both areas it has acted shamefully on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Israel maintains it is acting in self defence, but it is compounding the problem in the way it is dealing with the Palestinians. I call on the country to stand back and consider what it is doing because it is exacerbating current difficulties with every act of military violence. I applaud the creation of the state of Israel, but when looking at the Palestinians the Israelis should reflect that there is possibly little difference between Hamas and the Stern Gang.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a role to play. We must condemn atrocities and reject as utterly unacceptable the activities of the Israeli government, including its military action. We must also ensure that we are in a position to contribute to a peaceful process. We must reiterate that any resolution must be based on politics rather than killing or military activity. We should be prepared to play a middle role and support the moderates on both sides, in so far as any remain. Above all, we must support the route map outlined by Senator Mitchell as the only way towards a balanced and lasting solution to the conflict. The pre-conditions set by Prime Minister Sharon, including the insistence on a period of peace before negotiations can commence, are ridiculous. Both sides should be prepared to follow Senator Mitchell's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The US has a major role to play. It is largely considered to be a sponsor of Israel. It must be prepared to have a greater understanding of the difficulties on the Palestinian side. If not, it should stop pretending to be an honest broker.</P>
    <P>There has been too much emphasis on the financial and economic rather than the political in the role of the European Union. The Union has become increasingly involved in the Middle East in developing co-operation aid on the Palestinian side. Given this, it too has, to some extent, been viewed as a less than honest broker. If it is to be regarded as such the Union must play a role more in keeping with how it perceives itself. In addition, given that the Middle East is adjacent to Europe, the Union must play a much greater <Col N="1131" /> role in the attempt to find a resolution. In the meantime I urge all parties to the conflict and the main outside players &ndash; the United States and the European Union &ndash; to use every effort possible to draw back from the chasm into which the conflict has descended and to get back to the negotiating table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I have issued many statements on the Middle East. In the more recent statements, last August and earlier this month, I unequivocally condemned the appalling death of civilians that had taken place in Israel, both the circumstance and the form of the bombing. I today condemn the most recent killing of ten Israelis, again in horrific and unacceptable circumstances. The situation in the Middle East is disastrously sliding into terrible chaos from which it will be very difficult to recover. The forces of restraint, especially on Israel, have weakened and we are now likely to see a continuation of actions by groups whom Yasser Arafat cannot be expected to control and acts of retribution which fly in the face of international law.</P>
      <P>On my first visit to Gaza &ndash; the Gaza strip is 25 miles by 15 miles &ndash; over 20 years ago, I was appalled at the conditions in which people were forced to live. Neglected by the international community since 1947, they were in their third generation. Children played in sewers. On my second visit, the same water rationing was in place.</P>
      <P>The idea of a remembered, neglected wrong is central to one side of this conflict. It is impossible for anybody pursuing a moral resolution of the present terrible difficulties not to recognise the UN Security Council resolutions and verbal and rhetorical acceptances of the right of the Palestinian people to a viable existence and a viable state. Frustrations crossing several generations have emerged, producing not one but many intifada. On my second visit I encountered the only generation of Palestinians that had not been defeated in war.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the conflict there is a legitimate aspiration for a state of Israel and for those living in Israel, civilians and others, to live in security. To attempt to balance the frustrated and neglected aspiration of the Palestinians against the legitimate and basic right of the people of Israel to live in security it is necessary to consider if there is a parallel with the conflict in Northern Ireland. The approach to the resolution in Northern Ireland, to the extent that there is one, has been to recognise the source of conflict at several different levels. In addition to efforts made on the ground, initiatives were taken at constitutional and institutional levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see how the changes taking place in the Middle East will make possible the semblance of a dialogue. If one says that the person who sat opposite one at talks some time ago is now a person one would define as a terrorist and if one <Col N="1132" /> takes the authority that person represents as a sponsor of terrorism, it is legitimate to ask to whom one will turn if that logic is pursued to its end. The only answer is &ldquo;the defeated&rdquo;. If that is the suggested answer, there will be a choice between disparate groups acting out of any connection with the talks that have taken place or people who will have been defeated or humiliated or who will have a further memory into the next generation of an incredible, vicious and appalling loss of life. There has been a perceptible change in the actions of Prime Minister Sharon since September. It is clear to anybody watching from outside that the victory, to some extent, of militarism over diplomacy in different parts of the world has given an example of how one may now shed diplomacy and move to a military response which will, somehow or another, bring a resolution. It will bring disaster and it has the capacity to destabilise not just the immediate region but a much wider one.</P>
    <P>The language in which people suggest that executions from gunship helicopters are not just that but some form of surgical killing is an appalling moral point to have reached. I am offended by the fact that one or two people have written to me suggesting that my condemnation of the civilian deaths in Israel might be less than sincere. I am sincere in my condemnation of that. It is incredible that people are ignoring how the recent period began. It began with a provocative action &ndash; the visit to the mount. It began with Mr. Sharon's actions. We have seen the moderate attempts by Shimon Peres who has a distinguished record in seeking to build a peace process with the other side. It is not he who has eschewed, as it were, Chairman Arafat from the other side. Are these moderate peace views to be dismissed entirely? To what point are we moving?</P>
    <P>I was very worried by the interview given by Mr. Sharon in the United States and his further interview on his return home, in which he claimed he had a mandate, so to speak, for a whole new approach to the problem. That mandate is horrific in its consequences. Javier Solana's visit, which was referred to in the Minister's speech, has left me even more worried. It had been my interpretation of the European Union's possible initiatives on the Middle East that it would do something fresh and would act in a manner which resonated with actions that might be taken through the Security Council. It is now clear that the Security Council will not do much in the short-term. It is also very clear that, unfortunately, the interpretation of Javier Solana's visit, from both of the press conferences he gave, including the one with Prime Minister Sharon, was the European Union had changed its view and was now closer to the present US position. That is a disaster for the European Union. I know there will be a report at the Laeken meeting from Javier Solana to the Council and I hope there will be explanations about what I regard as his rather <Col N="1133" /> eccentric and dangerous statements, not only on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the prospect of an absolutely apocalyptic landscape being created. If one digs up an airstrip that is rarely used, if one bombs helicopters, if one disposes of the means of communication and if one seeks to isolate the person with whom one was previously negotiating, what suggested mechanisms are there for dialogue? I do not justify the release of prisoners who committed horrific acts and I am not saying I question whether the authority of President Arafat was sufficient to achieve what was asked of him. No matter how difficult it may be to initiate a long and complex negotiation towards peace, if the key individual with whom negotiations might take place is defined as a terrorist there is practically no hope at all. We should consider what would have happened if, at the time of the worst situation in Northern Ireland, people had suggested the suspension of dialogue and that there should be selective executions in the Republic of Ireland. I look forward to the Minister's reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with some of the points which have been raised in the debate, I wish to put on record some facts about the history of the land of Israel, beginning with nationhood and Jerusalem. Israel became a nation in 1312 BCE, two thousand years before the rise of Islam. Arab refugees in Israel began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern state of Israel. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 BCE, the Jews have had dominion over the land for one thousand years, with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 CE lasted no more than 22 years. For more than 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital and Arab leaders did not come to visit. Jerusalem is mentioned more than 700 times in the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Jerusalem is not mentioned once in the Koran. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward Jerusalem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict and Arab and Jewish refugees, in 1948 the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. A total of 68% left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier. The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated to be around 630,000. The number of Jewish refugees from Arab lands is estimated to be at least the same. Arab refugees were intentionally not absorbed or integrated into the Arab lands to <Col N="1134" /> which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory. Out of the 100,000 refugees since the Second World War, theirs is the only refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated into their own people's lands. Jewish refugees were completely absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey. The Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one Jewish nation.</P>
    <P>The Arab nations initiated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won. The PLO's charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank land, autonomy under the Palestinian authority, and has supplied them with weapons. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the Jews were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.</P>
    <P>With regard to the UN record on Israel and the Arabs, of 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions passed before 1990, 429 were directed against Israel. The UN was silent while the Jordanians destroyed 58 Jerusalem synagogues. The United Nations remained silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives; it was also silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the Western Wall; and it further remained silent after three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped just over a year ago by Hizbollah terrorists dressed as UN soldiers, using UN uniforms and a UN car. The existence of video tapes containing footage of these events, which was filmed by UN soldiers, was denied by the UN for over six months.</P>
    <P>I wish now to place on record some information about Mr. Arafat. When thousands of Chinese were mowed down in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the world said &ldquo;shocking&rdquo;, Arafat said &ldquo;gratifying&rdquo;; the world said &ldquo;murder and repression&rdquo;, Arafat said &ldquo;restoring normal order&rdquo;; and the world said &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; while Arafat said &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo;. I will now quote Yasser Arafat's actual words to the Chinese Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, which were printed in the <i>Beijing People's Daily</i>:</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Arab Palestinian people, their leadership and myself, I express the warmest, most sincere congratulations to you, dear comrade, on your appointment to General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, and take this opportunity to express extreme gratification that you were able to restore normal order after the recent incidents in People's China. I wish you, close friends, more progress in your endeavour to achieve the hopes, goals, <Col N="1135" /> aspirations, stability and security of our friends, the Chinese people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and I wish now to make a number of comments on it. He indicated that he &ldquo;expressed the Government's grave concern at the helicopter attacks in the vicinity of President Arafat's headquarters&rdquo;. I wish to point out that Israel attacks property not innocent civilians. The Israelis do not deliberately try to murder people. The Minister proceeded to state that &ldquo;We do not agree with the Israeli description of the Palestinian Authority as an entity that supports terrorism. We do not see what other partner Israel can have in fighting the terrorists&rdquo;. In that regard, where the Israelis destroyed police stations they had discovered that, in many cases, they were being used as bases to manufacture mortar bombs which were then fired from locations in their immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that &ldquo;As a first step, the following commitments would have to be given by the Palestinian Authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects; and a public appeal in Arabic for an end to the armed intifada&rdquo;. He proceeded to say that the Israeli Government would have to withdraw its military forces and put a stop to extra-judicial executions. In my opinion, one will follow the other if the Palestinians dismantle Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are terrorist groups but which are often referred to on RTE as &ldquo;resistance fighters&rdquo;. Even Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to them as &ldquo;extremist groups&rdquo;. They are more than extremist groups, they are terrorist organisations. If they Israelis know where these groups are and can take them out, surely the Palestinian Authority must also know where they are and should also be able to take them out.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that &ldquo;Ireland sees President Arafat as an indispensable partner for dialogue&rdquo;. Israel also saw him in this light for a long period, but there was a time when any Israeli who had discussions with him could have been found guilty of an offence and sent to jail because he was a terrorist. He has done nothing to stop the activities of Hamas, with the exception of making a few attempts to imprison some of its members. These people are usually released through the back door.</P>
    <P>Any democratic country has an obligation to defend its people and Israel will continue to do so until these organisations cease their terrorist activities. A total of 30 innocent people were killed in the atrocity at Omagh. However, Israel has experienced the equivalent of more than 30 such atrocities. In the past month or so, between 70 and 80 would be suicide bombers were caught by the Israelis and incarcerated before they could explode the devices they were carrying.</P>
    <P>I was pleased by the declaration on the Middle East issued by the European Union in Brussels on 10 December. This declaration, which, in my view, has been a long time coming, provided a <Col N="1136" /> reaffirmation and full recognition of Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. It also calls for the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state.</P>
    <P>I am glad I had the opportunity to place a number of points on record. In my opinion, Members would have welcomed the provision of 30 minutes per speaker to allow everyone to put their arguments across.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that the House should discuss the appalling conflict that has again descended on the Middle East. I welcome the fact that we are being given the opportunity to exchange views. I congratulate, as I did at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the context of the Irish Presidency of the Security Council and in pronouncements he has made in the past and reiterated today, the Minister has taken an important and constructive approach in terms of addressing the issues.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the first steps that need to be taken to deal with the conflict between Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the fundamentalist extremists of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups. There is nothing the Minister said with which I would disagree. However, there is one matter I wish to deal with.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of the entire situation in the Middle East as it stands at present is that 18 months ago on 25 July 2000 we were tantalisingly close to a final resolution between Israel and the Palestinians. Proposals were placed on the table at Camp David which would have formed the basis of a natural progression on the progress made at Madrid and Oslo. These proposals should have brought about a resolution of issues of the greatest difficulty for both sides in a manner that may have satisfied none, to the extent that neither side would have achieved its ultimate objectives, but which would have set out a compromise arrangement which should have resulted in the establishment of peace in the region. It is a great tragedy for President Arafat &ndash; who I have met on two occasions, once in this country and once, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, in Gaza &ndash; that what was then on offer was not accepted by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to resolve this problem would be to establish an independent Palestinian state side by side with that of Israel, with those living within the Israeli state living in peace and security and with that Palestinian state given the opportunity to develop economically in a manner that would address the obvious poverty and enormous difficulties faced by the Palestinian people at present. Instead, 18 months after the summit at Camp David, we have witnessed carnage, mayhem and appalling atrocities. While the House should not engage in the politics of condemning the last atrocity, we cannot also suspend judgment on some of the events that have occurred. Appalling acts of terrorist violence have been perpetrated <Col N="1137" /> against the State of Israel. Those acts have undermined the credibility and authority of President Arafat from the perspective of the Israelis in terms of his being involved in any negotiations that may take place. His tolerating a violent and unnecessary intifada for a period of 12 months has again brought the region to the verge of disaster. The current crisis has brought tragedy upon the State of Israel and those who live in it and also on the Palestinian people, and has entirely undermined the political credibility of the Palestinian Authority within the areas it governs.</P>
    <P>We in this House have reason to show very high regard for George Mitchell for the work he did on our peace process. The Mitchell report of May 2001 set out a prescription for resolution and the tragedy is that prescription has not been adhered to. I would caution Members, in the context of the rhetoric in which we in this House engage on occasions, and in making value judgments, against trying to analyse what has happened and what is currently happening in a manner that is not in tune with what George Mitchell says.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he says the ultimate solution is contained in the full implementation of the Mitchell report and not in the context of anyone cherry-picking recommendations in it, is recognising reality. It is important to refer to two or three things in that report. At the beginning of the report, George Mitchell says:</P>
    <P>Death and destruction will not bring peace but will deepen the hatred and hardened resolve on both sides. There is only one way to bring peace, justice and security in the Middle East and that is through negotiations.</P>
    <P>He also says</P>
    <P>Some Palestinians appear not to comprehend the extent to which terrorism creates fear among the Israeli people and undermines their belief in the possibility of co-existence, or the determination of the Government of Israel to do whatever is necessary to protect its people.</P>
    <P>That is a reality. We have seen, in the many months since the Mitchell report, continued acts of violence and terrorism which have resulted in the tragedy with which we are now confronted.</P>
    <P>For a long time I would have agreed with the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ndash; this is the only issue I raise with him by way of quibble because I think it is important &ndash; when he said: &ldquo;Ireland sees Arafat as the indispensable partner for dialogue.&rdquo; I know from my contacts with Israeli politicians on different sides of the spectrum, that a large number believed Yasser Arafat was the indispensable partner for dialogue. There were always those on different sides of the political spectrum in Israel who did not perceive him that way and who did not wish dialogue to take place. I know also, from my contacts over many years that there is an absolute desire to bring about peace, to end conflict and to provide for resolution through dialogue. The <Col N="1138" /> tragedy today is that those within the Israeli political spectrum who are committed to dialogue and peace &ndash; and large numbers of people within the Israeli state  &ndash; now doubt Arafat's capacity to be a partner for dialogue. They doubt &ndash; because of the events of the past 12 months &ndash; that dialogue conducted by him in the past was conducted in good faith. The concern that now arises is whether he is a partner for dialogue. That concern derives from things to which other Members of this House have referred.</P>
    <P>A partner for dialogue in the context of any conflict is a partner who is in control of the territory they purport to govern. We are told that President Arafat is unable to control the extremists in the Palestinian authority area. Should he attempt to do so he may find himself out of the position he currently occupies. What is the purpose, from an Israeli perspective, of conducting dialogue with a partner who cannot provide the peace and security they are seeking.</P>
    <P>George Mitchell has it right. We, in this House, should not try to selectively quote him or to water down what he had to say, but we need to acknowledge that the Mitchell report provides the political map through which this conflict should be addressed. &ldquo;The restoration of trust [George Mitchell says] is essential.&rdquo; He lists, in the context of the recommendations which need to be implemented, that the Palestinian authority should make clear, through concrete action, to Palestinians and Israelis that terrorism is reprehensible and unacceptable and that the Palestinian authority will make a 100% effort to prevent terrorism operations and to punish perpetrators.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which we, in the European Union, have is that there is a credibility gap between what on occasions the Palestinian authority has said it will do and what actually occurs. The political map which the Minister prescribed in his speech, the need to dismantle Hamas and Islamic Jihad, following that, for the Israeli Government to withdraw its military forces; the need to lift closures and the need for a freeze on settlements are all confidence building measures and steps which are essential if dialogue is to bring about a resolution.</P>
    <P>I hope we will see a change in the coming days but I am hugely pessimistic. I do not see, in the current context, dialogue taking place which will in the short-term bring an end to the appalling atrocities and violence we have all witnessed on our television screens in recent weeks and the continuing death, destruction and carnage which is impacting on so many innocent people in the region.</P>

      <P>Any views I express in this debate are mine and mine alone. I have expressed these views at the foreign affairs committee on several occasions. As many here know well, I am a staunch supporter of the United States, its foreign policies, its political system, way of life and the manner in which it protects us in the free world. Without the US, where would we be? However, I wholeheartedly disagree with its policy regarding Israel and Palestine in general. It is time this country and others in western Europe and the free world took a very definite stand against American policy in Israel and Palestine.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Palestinian people have any rights. They do not have the right to work or to operate manufacturing industries. They are treated as third-class citizens and often are treated as badly as is possible. Life in Gaza must be a wretched existence. We are a country with a history of suppression. I expect that we, above all other countries in the western world, would take the lead by expressing our displeasure in a tangible manner. We should break off diplomatic relations with Israel forthwith. I have said this to the Minister on a number of occasions and raised it with him only yesterday by way of question. It will not mean any major loss to this country but it would be an expression of our sympathy with the Palestinian people and it might give a lead to the world. It might make people sit up and think, something they are not currently doing.</P>
      <P>Irish people have a reputation for fair play and for standing up for the under privileged. We are not doing what we should for the Palestinians. It is no good anybody telling me that the Palestinians are terrorists and Yasser Arafat is responsible for the suicidal bombers who are striking Israel every second day. It is like saying John Hume was responsible for the IRA atrocities. Arafat is a moderate individual who has helped to calm those within the PLO and other militant Palestinian groups who wish to rise up and take part in an armed insurrection. His is the hand of moderation. We should help people who are moderate but we are not doing that. He has no control over Hamas or Hizbollah and for the Israelis to claim through their propaganda, day and night on radio and television, that it is Arafat's and the Palestinian Authority's fault is bunkum.</P>
      <P>We know the truth because we experienced a parallel situation on this island. Why should we support a state which uses the most modern aircraft, tanks, gunships and helicopters against defenceless people in many cases? They are killing people at random, just as Hamas does on the other side. Why should we support them? We should not. It is about time we publicly took a stand.</P>

        <b>: </b>The Israeli ruling class is clearly determined through its present policies to crush the aspirations of the Palestinian people for an independent homeland. Prime Minister Sharon has calculatedly set out to derail any dialogue. His visit to the al-Aqsa mosque, <Col N="1140" /> which set off the latest round of the intifada was a deliberate provocation. Ariel Sharon is a war criminal, guilty of colluding in the 1982 massacre of thousands of innocent Palestinian men, women and children in the Sabra and Shatila camps in the Lebanon. He holds responsibility for the 800 Palestinians and approximately 200 Israelis who have been killed in the recent past.</P>
      <P>The state terror being unleashed on the Palestinian people by the Israeli state must be called by its right name. It is monumental hypocrisy on the part of the United States to support the terrorist methods of the Israeli state, with murder and assassination as its stock in trade, while pretending to lead a crusade against terror elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The curse of the Palestinian people is that they do not have a leadership worthy of them. The Arafat regime is a corrupt and rotten entity, a mirror image of the dictatorial Arab regimes which repress the Arab peoples across the region and the Maghreb. The Hamas and Jihad organisations represent a reactionary obscurantist philosophy. Utilising terrorism to prosecute their cause through indiscriminate attack on innocent people, their methods are reactionary and counterproductive.</P>
      <P>What desperation compels Palestinian youths to become suicide bombers at the behest of these organisations? It is the appalling economic and social conditions. Life in Gaza is an affront to human dignity. I witnessed it myself. The massive desperation among the youth and the Palestinian people generally is the result of the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>There is a solution. It is the establishment of a Palestinian homeland, independent and free, and an Israeli state where its citizens can live in peace. None of the leading protagonists can deliver this or any type of future for the ordinary Israeli or Palestinian. The current crisis masks a serious economic crisis within Israel where there is huge discontent among the working class with regard to unemployment and living conditions.</P>
      <P>The Palestinian and the Israeli working class must make a common cause to overthrow the reactionary politicians who divide them and, on the basis of planning and democratic and socialist ownership of the region and its resources, a new future can be built.</P>

      <P>In the brief time available, I wish to express my own and my party's solidarity with the people of the Middle East at this terrible time in their history. South Africa has achieved a successful peace process based on freedom and justice. In Ireland, we are striving to achieve success for our peace process on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in Palestine and Israel the peace process has failed catastrophically and there is one indisputable reason. The Palestinian people have been denied freedom and justice by the State of Israel and its international supporters. The Palestinian people were promised land for peace but <Col N="1141" /> they have been denied their land and now Israel is waging open warfare upon them. The tragic death toll in the past year tells the story.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian people have suffered a plight akin to that of our own people. Communities have been evicted and uprooted, their country has been occupied and partitioned and over seven million of them have been forced into exile throughout the world. We see in Palestine today both the hypocrisy and the futility of the so-called war on terror &ndash; hypocrisy because the machine gunning of civilians from Israeli helicopter gunships is not regarded as terrorism but as combating terror and futility because it was the violence of the partition of Palestine, the repeated massacres of the Palestinian people and the botched peace process, which gave rise to the suicide bombers just as Israel's renewed war against Palestine will give rise to more of them.</P>
    <P>Today the Israeli army bulldozed a Palestinian television and radio station in Ramallah in the West Bank. This follows the decision to break off all contacts with the Palestinian Leader, Yasser Arafat. These are acts of madness which must be deplored by the Irish Government and the EU. We must demand justice for the Palestinian people as the only real foundation for peace in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>I wish to hear the Minister's views on two issues. The European Council meets in Laeken this weekend. Does the Minister accept that the conflict in the Middle East is at one of its most awful stages? In fact, some believe it is heading for Armageddon. Can the European Council bring forward any new initiative or fresh approach in terms of establishing a stronger EU policy to try to get the parties out of the chasm of chaos into which they have descended?</P>
      <P>The second issue is Chairman Arafat and the references to his inability to control the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Does the Minister have any understanding from the Israeli authorities of a decision to by-pass Mr. Arafat by either having him disposed of or at least driven from power? Has he given any thought to what the consequences of such an outcome might be? Do we know if the Israeli strategy is to encourage civil war among the Palestinians as the only way to defuse tensions on that side? Is it hoped that they might turn on each other in a succession race following the downfall of Chairman Arafat? Is there any indication that this is the strategy being followed and might part of that strategy be the announcement today that the Israelis are breaking off all contact with Chairman Arafat?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether the Israeli government wishes to deal with President Arafat is important. When I met Foreign Minister Peres in Brussels on Monday, he assured me that Israel is not seeking to topple President Arafat. He said <Col N="1142" /> it is Israel's wish to see a modern cabinet and government structure for Palestinians. It is clear that the current Israeli action is not helping the work of the Palestinian Authority and I made this point to Foreign Minister Peres. I am also concerned by various statements, particularly from Prime Minister Sharon, which suggest that Israel no longer sees President Arafat as a negotiating partner. This is precisely the dilemma.</P>
      <P>When I met President Katsav on 10 September, which is not long ago, the critique he gave me was that Israel believed President Arafat was never in a stronger position to do what was necessary to ensure the peace process could proceed according to the Tenet agreement and the Mitchell proposals. Within two months there is now a suggestion or critique which says he is incapable of doing anything that is required. This is where I find an inconsistent approach. Both are wide of the mark. President Arafat cannot do everything but, equally, he cannot do nothing. What is clear is that the Mitchell plan has been accepted precisely because it is tough on both sides. As has been said by Members, only implementation of the full Mitchell plan will work. However, the problem in getting the Mitchell plan to leave the train station has been the cooling-off period. When I speak to those such as Mr. Solana, who was on the Mitchell plan commission, I am told the idea behind the confidence building measures was not to reward the cessation of hostilities over a period of time, as is the present Israeli position and particularly that of the Prime Minister, but to progress in tandem with a declaration of ceasefire.</P>
      <P>The basic analysis in the Mitchell plan is that there cannot be a military solution. Both the Israeli and Palestinian sides know that militarisation, and the atrocities taking place are not providing extra security for anybody. Instead, authorities and governments are responding to angered domestic public opinion. The situation then deteriorates into the politics of the last atrocity. People should step back and recognise that the interlocutor is the Palestinian Authority. There were elections to the Palestinian Authority conducted under the auspices of the European Union. Those elections were one of the major contributions by the EU to the Middle East peace process. The Authority has a democratic mandate.</P>
      <P>Nabil Shaath said on Monday that at the moment opinion polls give the Authority 29% support while Hamas has 25% support. If this problem is to be solved, the Israelis must deal with the legitimate head of the Palestinian Authority. Peace is not made with friends but with enemies. The Palestinians may not like the fact that the Israelis have by democratic mandate decided that Mr. Sharon is to be their Prime Minister. Equally, the Israelis cannot say &ldquo;We do not like your chairman at the moment. Change him and then we will talk to you.&rdquo; That is not an acceptable democratic basis on which to resolve the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Deputy O'Keeffe asked a straight question. It is clear from what has been done so far that the Israelis have hit at President Arafat's headquarters. They have been engaged in lowering his status among his people. Whether intended or not, that is the effect. Based on what Shimon Peres has told me &ndash; he is a person I respect &ndash; and on background security information including a discussion with Nabil Shaath, the questions asked were whether the Israelis agree that it is with the Palestinian Authority they must deal, and whether the Israelis consider the Palestinian Authority a genuine partner for peace. The answer was yes to both questions and there is an attempt to re-establish a basis for trust on both sides.</P>
    <P>I have to accept, both on the evidence and on the statements of Peres, that they are dealing with Arafat. I am very concerned, however, with what I hear the Israeli Prime Minister saying. There is a duality of opinion in the Israeli Government. To what extent we can overcome that is another part of the jigsaw that must be put in place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU, Javier Solana's envoy has just visited the region to get a picture of what is happening on the ground. He will be reporting to the European Council tomorrow as a result of his visit. It is clear that the common position of the European Union is implementation of the Mitchell plan. I have not yet read the press reports referred to by Deputy Michael Higgins, but I will examine them to obtain some context as to Mr. Solana's visit to the Middle East. It is important that, as we search for a solution to the present downward spiral, we do not move away from the principled position which is the implementation of the Mitchell plan. That plan, as intended by Mitchell, is the common position and there is no other.</P>

      <P>Can the EU take a new approach to influencing Iran and Syria, who have a big interest in keeping Hizbollah and Hamas active, and in arming and training those groups? I do not hear from European visits to Iran and Syria that the message is getting across that the sooner they stop supporting these groups, who kill people through terrorist acts, the better. It would be a big step forward if that message could be got across. The Minister might discuss this matter at tomorrow's conference in Laeken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Madrid process, begun in 1991, envisaged a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all of its manifestations, not simply the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is important to recognise the progress that has been made. The idea that this process is just a talking shop where nothing is happening is wide of the mark. We have had the Madrid process and the Oslo process, which began in 1993. We have the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty of 1994. Last year, we had Palestinians and Israelis discussing final status talks. There has been movement although not <Col N="1144" /> sufficient progress. Unfortunately, we see highs and lows that are greatly destabilising the prospect of a sustained process that might have a positive outcome.</P>
      <P>In the EU-led process, I have engaged with the Syrian Foreign Minister al-Shara. I met him at the UN in bilateral discussion as an outcome of our EU-led meeting. Syria has a very rigid, dogmatic approach to this issue, based on a return to pre-1967 borders, water and other issues. They will not get into negotiation until that is ceded. The Israeli position, as I understand it from Shimon Peres, is that they first wish to negotiate and get into a process, even if that ends up close to the Syrian position, in line with UN Security Council resolutions. It is very unfortunate that the Syrians and the Israelis, whose relationship is not good, have been unable to get into some sort of a negotiating framework. That is hindering the opportunities for progress.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal by Israel from Lebanon to internationally recognised borders, and Hizbollah participation in the resistance, as they saw it, to occupation by the Israeli government in south Lebanon, has sent certain signals that such a path of resistance is the way to go. That has been misread and the conclusion has been reached by some that this method should now be replicated in Palestine and elsewhere. That is a dangerous thing because the Israelis have the power and capacity to defend Israel from all comers. They have done so five times already.</P>
      <P>There is much discussion ongoing between Iran and the international community, particularly in the post-11 September period, because of the particular composition of the government there and the attitude it has taken to the Taliban. It has been opposed to the Taliban at all times because its ethnic constituency, if you like, or its religious constituency, the Shias in the central highland area of Afghanistan, have historically, it is felt, been discriminated against by successive regimes. Thankfully, there has been a reopening and a deepening of discussion with Iran, principally through the US and the UK, which I hope might lead to a constructive role being played by them in this process.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, and I have taken up very little of the time.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister straightforwardly about the report that may have been given to him or since to Javier Solana on his visit to the Middle East. I am not going to say more because the Minister undertook to examine the press statements. There is no reference to the Mitchell plan, as I understand it, in the Israeli statement following the visit of Javier Solana. There is, however, a very specific reference to the suggestion that they see it as the European Union position as having moved closer to the new United States position. I believe that warrants clarification. It is not consistent with the common position of the European Union up to now and it does not assist a new position. The second question relates to such discussion he might have had as to the conversations between Prime Minister Sharon and the United States as to the basis for Mr. Sharon's suggestion that it was a most successful visit and gives him a new mandate.</P>
      <P>In relation to his contacts with Shimon Peres, the Minister has said he believes communications are still under way. Did Foreign Minister Peres give any indication as to the role the European Union might take in getting past the impasse of a difference between himself and Prime Minister Sharon in terms of reopening discussions within the general parameters of the Mitchell plan? Does the Minister agree in principle with some of us in this House at least that it is not consistent with international law or obligations to justify acts of state terror as responses to suggested acts of terrorism or real acts of terrorism? Is the position of the Irish Government that it sustains the international legal positions sustained by covenant that a state is not free to act disproportionately and involve itself in acts of state terrorism against acts of terrorism? Does the Minister see the European Union maybe achieving a common position towards an initiative at the Security Council that would get us past the present impasse &ndash; and I am thinking of the next week or two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the view of the Irish Government, and stated by it in recent days, that this is an issue which should be discussed by the Security Council. There is a threat to international peace and security and under international law, it is a forum which has a <i>locus standi</i> in this matter to discuss. As to how it would come on the agenda, if it was the Palestinians who were looking to put it on the agenda usually they would go through the non-aligned movement group. It is not for us to second guess the Palestinians but there has been no request from the NAM group to discuss it at this stage. There has, however, been a consistent fixation with further resolutions of the Security Council being the only means by <Col N="1146" /> which the Security Council should discuss this, and I do not agree with that. The idea of a resolution which is drafted in such a way that will obviously attract a veto is clearly not beneficial to anybody.</P>
      <P>During our Presidency of the Council, we strove very hard and, indeed, had available a Presidency statement which would have had unanimous agreement, including US agreement, on the calling for a withdrawal from areas A, etc. I would have seen this as an advance in public terms which should be grasped when the opportunity comes so that if, as a result of the Presidency statement contents not being implemented, the question of a resolution could then be considered on the same basis. This will denote progress. I have stated to our Palestinian colleagues and to others that it has not been clear to me what the strategy at UN level is as far as the Palestinian Authority is concerned. I respectfully suggest that it needs to address that question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about Shimon Peres, who is seen as a moderating influence, certainly within the Israeli Government, and how the European Union might be able to assist in bringing that point of view more into the ascendant. The <i>realpolitik</i> of the situation in my view and judgment is that as long as this present level of violence continues, the prospect of that happening is reduced all the time. Therefore, one of the issues being addressed to Nabil Sh'ath on Monday is the question of strategy. I know how difficult it is for the Palestinian Authority to do certain things but in the interests of its people, getting us to a process, putting the responsibilities where they lie and providing leverage for a Government like Israel to respond in kind, there is a need for it to do more than it is doing now, however difficult it may be, while recognising that the tactic being used by Israel is complicating and making it more difficult to do what needs to be done without shying away from the fact certain things need to be done. That, of course, reinforces the distrust and suspicion as to what real Israeli intentions are. Then we come back to this dual approach where I do not see, frankly, a sufficient breadth of consideration being given to the complexity of all these issues in the Israeli position as it is emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Solana visit and the Israelis feeling the European Union is moving closer to the American position, again I have to consider that and examine what precisely that is about but I would say that it may be the following. It is clear from the statement that came out of the General Affairs Council on Monday that there is a necessity for the Palestinian Authority to do more but that is not to be at the expense of the Israelis doing less. We are asking the Palestinians to do more precisely because the Israelis must do more. We are back again to this dynamic as to how we trigger this process. The United States needs to use the undoubted influence it has with the Israeli Government and administration to get it to see that trying to solve the immediate <Col N="1147" /> issues in an exclusively military sense has no prospects and greatly exacerbates the situation for its own citizens &ndash; let alone the difficulties it is causing for the people in the territories and in the Authority area.</P>
    <P>The European Union with the United States, Russia and the United Nations &ndash; despite the very stereotypical views that are dominant in Israeli political circles about all of these bodies for, I think unjustified reasons &ndash; are trying to be political circles about all these bodies for unjustified reasons. We are trying to be honest brokers and to be fair and honourable to all sides. Remember that there were three Europeans on the Mitchell commission that drafted the Mitchell report. The idea that we are not participating as we should is wrong.</P>
    <P>Another point that is often forgotten is that the European Union is providing the financial lifeline for a Palestinian Authority whose ability to survive is under threat &ndash; financially and economically &ndash; because of Israeli policies, closure of territories, and the failure to allow people go to work under the permit system in Israel. Often, that is not factored in sufficiently by successive Israeli administrations. There is a need for them not to suggest that the EU is participating on behalf of Palestinians as their cheerleader. The EU has a far more sophisticated and balanced position. Israeli governments should recognise that, because of EU support, there is still a Palestinian Authority as interlocutor. Without the EU's support, apart from the political mess that would obtain in the Middle East, the economic and financial reality would be that the Palestinian Authority would not survive. That gives legitimate leverage to the EU, which has equal standing as a partner with the United States, which is also clearly indispensable in terms of trying to broker a deal. The EU must be given the <i>locus standi </i>that it has not been given in the past.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the EU is the biggest market Israel has. Up to 44% of its exports go to the EU. There are issues concerning products of origin going through arbitration at the moment. They can no longer be regarded as procedural, are coming to a head and must be dealt with. Prime Minister Mr. Sharon's catch phrase is &ldquo;I say what I mean and I mean what I say&rdquo;. We are coming to a point in the EU's economic relationship with Israel where we have to say what we mean and mean what we say. The arbitration procedure has been an elongated, exhaustive one, and has not a semblance of resolution on the basis of a clear agreement ordaining that Israel be dealt with in the same way other countries are dealt with in the EU. There is insignificant recognition of that problem either, which has been very kindly handled by the EU in the interests of trying to be helpful and legitimately influential as it tries to broker this deal between Israel and Palestine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to the second part of Deputy Shatter's question. He may have been out of the House for a moment when I answered Deputy Briscoe's question in the same vein. The record will show my position. There is no doubt that suicide bombing deeply affects the psyche of the Israeli people. With regard to the disagreement the EU has with Israel, when I asked Shimon Peres why there are killings taking place, he said: &ldquo;We stop 80% of what is coming through. It is called a ticking bomb. Once they are on the move, we have no way of controlling it.&rdquo;. He justifies killing those people for that reason. That is his explanation. Under international law, it is important that all efforts be <Col N="1149" /> made to apprehend people and bring them to justice etc. We all know the law. These questions are asked by Ireland. They are asked in a frank way between two countries that have full diplomatic relations, which should be maintained.</P>
      <P>We have a basic disagreement with Deputy Deasy on this point. By having diplomatic relations with Israel, I was able to speak on the telephone to Shimon Peres on Saturday afternoon. I was able to speak to him on Monday bilaterally. I am not sure how many others he saw bilaterally. I spoke to him in Jerusalem at length because, in an effort to ensure that the tragedy for both Israelis and Palestinians stops, I want to offer a perspective based on our experience of peace building, not that the origin of the Israeli conflict is the same as the origin of ours. However, that is what we offer.</P>
      <P>If we want to get involved in what I regard as token politics, we can tell the world that we have such moral sensibilities that we will break off diplomatic relations with the state of Israel. How could we influence events then? How soon would we be listened to by what is the democratically elected government of Israel? One might disagree with its politics and policies and its reactions to the crisis, as I do, but I am not in the business of walking away and saying I will not deal with the problem. I want to contribute. I have listened to colleagues at EU level talking about this problem, whose sincerity I accept absolutely, who do not know how hard it is make peace with one's enemies. Some of them do from their own historical experiences following the Second World War.</P>
      <P>Having been involved in the Irish peace process, I know how difficult it is to do the right thing and sustain support. What one has to do is identify people on the other side and agree that, whatever happens, the hill will be climbed together, even it means being thrown down every so often. It must also be agreed that extremists on either side will not be allowed to derail the process at the expense of the wider good, which is that people will get up some morning and tend to their olive trees, whether they are Israeli or Palestinian, and live a decent life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Shimon Peres speak eloquently about his vision for peace and of two states existing side by side between the Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. It is heartening that there are still people in the midst of this cataclysmic series of events who have the moral courage to express themselves thus. They need support. I do not agree with Shimon Peres on every issue but I admire him. He has difficulties with his own Government and I know how the axis of politics in Israel has moved to the right and how scattered the peace movement is. These are difficult times for those in Israeli politics who are interested in peace. If we want we can criticise and show that criticism by taking extreme measures against those we feel are not coming up to the mark and not showing the vision necessary in positions of leadership in the Israeli Administration. <Col N="1150" /> Satisfying myself when I go home that I hit a home run and got a headline by withdrawing diplomatic relations with Israel does not strike me as a manly or constructive idea given that people are dying as we speak.</P>
    <P>I say the same to the Palestinian Authority. I say to Nabil Shaath that there are governance issues in relation to the Authority that must be resolved. There are credibility gaps, but there were also credibility gaps in our peace process last August. I told those who had influence that if they wanted to close the gap they had to do what they had been holding back from, which was putting arms beyond use and that if they did not we would not be able to sustain the process. There are credibility gaps at present in the Middle East peace process and some people are going to have to do more than they did before to satisfy those of goodwill on the other side &ndash; the people who want to stick with this process and who hope the visions of Madrid and Oslo become a reality for their people. It is our job to support those interested in that process.</P>

      <P>The effect of these amendments is that certain sections of the Bill will come into operation upon enactment. At present section 1(2) provides that the Bill's provisions will be brought into operation by orders to be made by the Minister. The reason for these amendments is the necessity to ensure that certain provisions of the Bill are in force before 1 January 2002. The particular provisions are those which implement commitments at EU level in relation to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and measures to combat money laundering more effectively. Because of this tight timeframe it is necessary to provide for the commencement of the appropriate provisions immediately upon enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the operation of these particulate provisions requires that a number of other sections in the Bill also be in operation. Accordingly it is necessary to provide for the simultaneous commencement of those other sections, and these amendments will do that. In brief, the provisions which will come into operation upon enactment of the Bill are section 23, dealing with reporting certain financial transactions for the <Col N="1151" /> purpose of preventing money laundering, Part V, dealing with currency counterfeiting, Part VII, which deals with the investigation of offences, section 53, which permits offences to be dealt with summarily, section 58, concerning the liability of bodies corporate, and section 60(1), concerning the use of documentary evidence in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>This amendment corrects an error which resulted in a number of words being omitted from subsection (7) paragraph (4) of the new section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. Subsection (7) clarifies in part a number of concepts contained in the new section 31. Paragraph 4 provides that reference to believing that property is or represents criminal proceeds should be taken as including reference to thinking that the property &ldquo;was probably, or probably represented&rdquo; criminal proceeds. The omission of the words &ldquo;or probably&rdquo; arose due to the fact that the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; appears twice in close proximity in the paragraph.</P>

      <P>Section 21 of the Bill substitutes a new section for section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. The new section 31 criminalises various actions which amount to money laundering. These actions include laundering by a person of his or her own criminal proceeds as well as laundering by a third party of another's criminal proceeds. The section penalises various actions where a person knows or believes, or is reckless about whether property is or represents criminal proceeds. These actions include converting, transferring or handling the property for the purpose of concealing its true nature etc., assisting another person to avoid prosecution for the criminal conduct concerned or to avoid a confiscation order being made. The person will also commit an offence where the action amounts to concealing the property's true nature etc., or where the person acquires, possesses or uses it.</P>
      <P>Clearly financial institutions and other persons providing financial services are prime targets for those trying to launder dirty money. The 1994 Act therefore places certain obligations on these institutions to have in place measures to detect and report suspicions of money laundering. For example, section 32 requires these institutions to &ldquo;know their customers&rdquo; and section 57 requires them to report to the Garda suspicions of money laundering. There is also a provision, in section 58, which penalises anyone who prejudices any investigation into suspected money laundering by, for example, revealing that an investigation is under way or by tipping off an account holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that under the new section 31 money laundering may consist of acquiring, possessing or using criminal proceeds, concern was expressed that an institution will have to, in addition to reporting any suspicion of laundering, divest itself of any account which it suspects is being used for money laundering or risk prosecution under the Act. In doing this, however, there was concern that it may be contravening the <Col N="1153" /> provision against revealing that the account is being investigated by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>This amendment addresses this dilemma. It provides that where the institution has reported to the gardaí its suspicions, or where the gardaí have informed the institution that it is suspected of being used for money laundering, the institution will not be guilty of laundering or of tipping off a person if, and for so long as, it is complying with Garda directions in the matter. It is entirely appropriate that the section should provide for such an eventuality and this amendment does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proper that the 1994 Act puts an onus on financial institutions to bring any suspicions they have to the authorities about money laundering. We have seen financial institutions complicit, through offshore non-resident accounts, with tax cheating, though money laundering was not involved. Many of those participating were not really aware of the implications of the accounts they were operating. This new Act could have put the banks and financial institutions in a difficult position and this amendment, as the Minister points out, gives them protection. We support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my late arrival, but I did not realise that I would be called to speak so soon. I spoke last night about the clear evidence that the cost of cigarettes is a factor in reducing the level of cigarette smoking in this country, a point that was recently reinforced by Dr. Luke Clancy. I referred to the World Bank Group's report, the Economics of Tobacco Control, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scores of studies have shown that increased taxes reduce the number of smokers and the number of smoking-related deaths. Price increases induce some smokers to quit and prevent others from becoming regular or persistent smokers. They also reduce the number of ex-smokers returning to cigarettes and reduce consumption among continuing smokers. Children and adolescents are more responsive to changes in the price of consumer goods than adults, that is, if the price goes up, they are more likely to reduce their consumption. This intervention would therefore have a big <Col N="1154" /> impact on them. Similarly, people on low incomes are more price-responsive than those on high incomes, so there is likely to be a bigger impact in developing countries where tobacco consumption is still increasing.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments made against an increase in the price of cigarettes is that it would lead to an increase in cigarette smuggling. However, the World Bank report refutes this:</P>
    <P>Smuggling is a serious concern, but even in the face of smuggling, the evidence from a number of countries shows that tax increases still increase revenues and reduce cigarette consumption. Furthermore, Governments can adopt effective policies to control smuggling. Such policies include prominent tax stamps and local language warnings on cigarette packs, as well as the aggressive enforcement and consistent application of tough penalties to deter smugglers.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is already a large and lucrative illegal trade in cigarettes, notwithstanding the fact that price increases have not been prohibitive. An international cigarette smuggling route was uncovered this week when 80 million smuggled cigarettes were found at Dundalk port. It appears that criminal traders have used Ireland as a back door route to the United Kingdom. Recent discoveries have shown that terrorist organisations are benefiting from cigarette smuggling and this is borne out by the involvement of the Provisional IRA in a major cigarette theft at Belfast docks. I congratulate those responsible for bringing some of the criminals to justice and this House encourages the authorities to persist in their work. Since we know that smuggling is an ever-present danger which has to be overcome, we should not accept it as a false argument in favour of keeping the price of cigarettes low.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more familiar with my arguments than the Minister for Health and Children as I suspect he has made similar arguments on a number of occasions. The Government chose to ignore the case for substantial increases in the prices of tobacco products and increased prices moderately in the recent budget. I have been struck by the fact that many people, including smokers, see the Government's failure to make the hard decision as a negative feature of the budget. It an interesting phenomenon that one would not have encountered in the past. Smokers used to give a sigh of relief and happily continue to smoke if the price of cigarettes did not alter to any great extent. There has been a cultural change and smokers are feeling the pressure, although they still find it difficult to kick the habit. It is worth asking why this change has come about. Research on Irish attitudes to smoking and smoking prohibition, carried out by the Office of Tobacco Control, shows that smokers are critical of the lack of Government action to make smoking less attractive to young people and to help smokers to stop. The office concludes that smokers are frustrated by their efforts to kick the <Col N="1155" /> habit; 72% of them would like to give up and 68% have tried. Smokers recognise the dangers and social unacceptability of their addiction all too well.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children must be greatly disappointed by the failure of his campaign to exclude tobacco prices from the consumer price index. There is broad agreement that increases in the cost of tobacco products assist those who wish to stop smoking and, more importantly, prevent younger people from starting to smoke. Raising tobacco prices helps people to overcome the addiction. By creating a CPI which excludes tobacco, the Government would remove a definite impediment to ongoing increases. The Irish CPI is compiled by the Central Statistics Office, which publishes a CPI sub-index for tobacco, thereby making it feasible to publish and use a national CPI without tobacco. Despite the protests of the Minister for Health and Children, the Government feels that the exclusion of tobacco from the CPI is unfeasible as it would cause problems within the European Union. I find it hard to believe this difficulty would not be overcome if the Minister for Finance was sufficiently enthusiastic and campaigned on the issue with his European counterparts.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that uniformity is needed when comparing price indices across Europe, but surely the Governments of other European countries see the merit of increasing the price of cigarettes. It is one of the few deterrents that is effective and leads to fewer young people beginning to smoke. Prevention is much better than cure in this case as addiction to tobacco is severe. It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance yet again has shown himself to be unsympathetic to arguments made with good public health in mind.</P>
    <P>The problems with the European Union highlight an anomaly that has existed for some time. While Health Ministers and the European Parliament are increasingly promoting measures to reduce smoking, the European Union is subventing tobacco growers, especially in the poor Mediterranean regions. I know the subvention will cease within a few years, but its existence underlines the fact that employment in the tobacco industry is an issue of concern in many countries, including Ireland. Manufacturers, including cigarette companies, enjoy beneficial rates of corporation tax. Almost 1,000 people are employed in the tobacco industry in Ireland in Gallahers, PJ Carrolls and smaller companies such as Villagers of Ballaghaderreen. Quite apart from the powerful, unrelenting pressure from the tobacco industry, there is also the argument which is not enunciated clearly, but which is part of the subtext when it comes to challenging the tobacco companies, that people's livelihoods depend on this industry.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary that a spokesperson for the Irish Tobacco Manufacturing Advisory Committee pointed out that 95% of the cigarettes sold in Ireland are manufactured here. He suggested <Col N="1156" /> that it is better that cigarettes sold here are manufactured here, rather than abroad. It is not an advantage that cigarettes are manufactured in Ireland. This is part of the problem which must be addressed in terms of finding ways, creating alternatives or setting targets to reduce the level of cigarette manufacturing, along with the other measures which have been discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to convince us that he was somehow getting the message across by sponsoring the snooker championship. Young women are the growth cohort among smokers, but I am not sure if many of them are involved in snooker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be surprised. I am not suggesting that young women do not get involved in snooker, but that they do not figure largely in it. If one is to sponsor anti-smoking campaigns, it might be better to find a more effective means of targeting those at risk.</P>
      <P>ASH Ireland is doing a remarkable job in promoting the arguments against smoking and in acting as a watchdog on decisions made by the Oireachtas and by the Minister for Health and Children in particular. The organisation has made the point that Ireland is losing the battle against the scourge of nicotine addiction given that about 7,000 smokers die each year. ASH has pointed out that, after some success in the past, a recent survey shows a 2% increase in smoking levels. It also notes that the number of young women who smoke is on the increase which is directly linked to identifying and targeting a key market by the tobacco industry.</P>
      <P>It is important to note what happens as changes are made in terms of restrictions on advertising and sponsorship. It is like dealing with a multi-headed hydra. If one deals with sponsorship and advertising, as sure as eggs are eggs one will have to start combating the same pressure in terms of promotion, propaganda and targeting in some other area. We have seen evidence of this and it is clear that we are dealing with a powerful, lucrative industry which will resist any restriction on its activities in every way possible. It is disappointing that no Irish cigarette company has ended up in court and that the Minister has not taken any case in terms of standing up to these powerful interests who are ruining lives, and, in particular, shortening young lives in a manner which must be combated like for like.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the new agency may take various courses of action. The agency may require companies to do certain things and provide certain information. What the agency will insist on, and how effective the regulations, measures and penalties for non-compliance will be, will have to be carefully thought out in light of the kind of targeting and ways and means which the tobacco industry is using.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read some time ago in a British newspaper that, as with alco-pops, tobacco companies have been adding various tastes to cigarettes to tempt <Col N="1157" /> children to become addicted. They use sweet tasting additives to disguise the taste of alcoholic drinks. They are also now using cocoa, coffee and vanilla. Approved cigarette ingredients now include honey, maple syrup, molasses, liquorice and any number of fruit extracts from pineapple and cherry to apricot and banana. The article went on to point out that there is no obligation on manufacturers to list such additives on the cigarette packaging.</P>
    <P>The article further highlights that cigarette manufacturers have an acute need to recruit new smokers. The problem for the cigarette industry is that smokers keep dying, thus affecting sales. There is an imperative on cigarette companies to keep recruiting more smokers. Each year in Britain about 120,000 of the industry's customers die from smoking related diseases. Research shows that people who do not start smoking before the age of 20 are unlikely to start at all. This means the industry must hook new smokers in their childhood or teen years. This is the purpose behind the targeting which is going on. The success of the industry in such tactics is shown by recent surveys which highlight that 5% of 11 year olds are addicted to tobacco, rising to 43% of 15 year olds.</P>
    <P>The figures for Ireland are probably equivalent to those in Britain. Our figures are certainly disturbing in terms of the high percentage of the population which smokes. The Minister seemed to take comfort in the fact that the figure used to be 40%, but is now down to 30% or 31% which is still extraordinarily high. It has to be continually stressed that the figure is growing among young people, particularly among young women and women generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his decision, which I welcome, to make nicotine patches available on the medical card. However, we must recognise that not everyone is aware of this. I recently advised a woman to go back to her doctor who told her, prior to the Minister's decision, that the patches were not available on the medical card. Dr. Luke Clancy has pointed out that only 18% of smokers were availing of this measure. There is an information deficit. It is relatively easy for GPs to contact people who should be targeted, but not enough of this kind of work is done at general practice level. As part of an anti-smoking strategy, doctors should be encouraged to target those patients who may be able to avail of the nicotine patches.</P>
    <P>The Minister frequently refers to the cardio-vascular strategy which has been in operation for some time. There is a need for this strategy because of our high rate of heart disease which is about twice the EU average. As a result of this high rate we have a lower life expectancy than most EU citizens. As part of the strategy, GPs are urged, particularly when treating medical card holders, to play a greater role in treatment and in areas such as blood pressure checks, the use of aspirin and supports to help people stop smoking. This is all very well if a patient has a medical card <Col N="1158" /> but it highlights the practical damage done by the Minister's decision not to increase the number of people in the general medical services scheme. When people assess the Government's achievement in health they will see that despite spending additional money, the number of people with medical cards went down during the lifetime of the Government. That is a terrible indictment. The value for money audit by Deloitte &amp; Touche showed that medical cards are good value and we know they are the means whereby doctors can carry out preventive medicine, encourage patients to come back to them without fear of having to pay, and carry out good practice in a way which is impossible when paying the doctor is a block for patients. When people with weekly incomes of £100 are obliged to pay doctors' bills, blood pressure checks and other procedures to encourage people to stop smoking simply cannot be done. How can a doctor call in a patient who would have great financial difficulty in coming to the surgery? </P>
    <P>The Minister's decision with regard to medical cards makes the health strategy, and the cardiovascular strategy in particular, suspect because its effectiveness in application cannot be measured. Many of the points in both strategies are extremely important and very valuable but if people are prevented by their income from availing of these good and practical measures, then the Minister must admit he has got it wrong. Because of the Minister's decision many measures will not reach those most in need. It was a bad decision.</P>
    <P>The decision underpins the issue of inequality in the health service. Earlier, when speaking about Deputy Liam Lawlor, Members spoke of a two-tier justice system. We know we have a two tier health system. Inequality is evident at every level. Apart from the accident and emergency unit, inequality is the norm. Yet it is an aberrant feature when compared with other European health services. Measures to encourage a reduction in smoking and good health care for patients who suffer from smoking related illnesses are distorted as a consequence of the inherent inequality in the provision of health care.</P>
    <P>The issue of banning smoking in pubs is not dealt with in the Bill, although I am sure the Minister will say it is dealt with in general terms. This may be true in theory. However, there are only a few months left to the Government and if one is to deal with this issue it must be done now. I do not believe the Minister will confront this difficult issue. He will have the support of the opposition if he proceeds down that route but I do not believe he will do the painful thing in the days before an election. I have been lobbied on this issue by retailers and vending machine suppliers but not to a great extent by publicans. I have received the usual amount of briefing but publicans do not feel they are under pressure on this issue. This is an indicator. If publicans are not <Col N="1159" /> uncomfortable in the way one might expect if the Minister was going to deal with the issue, we can presume they know what will be done.</P>
    <P>We often laugh at the zeal with which smoking is discouraged in the United States, but the results achieved in that country are tremendous. There has been an enormous and accelerating reduction both in smoking and in smoking related diseases. We must keep this message at the forefront of our minds. It is not just a matter of going through the motions and saying the right things. If we are vigorous enough, focused enough and brave enough, it is possible to deal with this addiction in an effective way but it requires enormous energy and commitment. This Bill does not contain an expression of that commitment. However, I will support the Bill and try to add a little vim and vigour to it. I look forward to committee stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has attracted much attention inside and outside the House. We often deal with legislation which people outside the House feel has little or no bearing on their lives. However, this Bill will have an effect on almost every citizen and it is important that it contains measures which are for the benefit of the people, while recognising the traditions which have survived for many years.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, is to give greater legislative powers for regulating and controlling the sale, marketing and smoking of tobacco. As a schoolboy I bought cigarettes. Most young people go through a phase of smoking out of the sight of adults. Smoking is something which most young people try at some stage but for most this is merely a phase to be gone through while growing up. Unfortunately, for many young people smoking becomes an addiction which marks their lives and which they find very difficult to shake off.</P>
      <P>People who become addicted to smoking pay a huge price, in terms of money and health. Deputy McManus has complained that cigarettes are too cheap but the majority of smokers would not agree with her. Because it is an addiction, people are compelled to buy cigarettes. They spend a considerable amount of their disposable incomes on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no comparison between the monetary side of the issue and the health aspect. A lifetime of smoking has to have a serious effect on anyone's health. In most cases people suffer as their health deteriorates, starting off with breathing problems. Some unfortunately will develop cancer. As a number of speakers have pointed out, from the research available it can be estimated that up to 7,000 people die each year from tobacco-related diseases. Not all smokers die from tobacco-related diseases but if 7,000 are dying each year, and one can imagine the number of people hospitalised because of similar illnesses, some idea can be obtained of the number of beds that are taken up as a result of tobacco use. It <Col N="1160" /> causes enormous problems everywhere and brings with it a large expense in terms of the demand on the health services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, with limited exceptions, and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry. I am pleased this ban will be introduced. The tobacco industry is extremely wealthy. It has had no difficulty over the years spending much that money on advertising campaigns which are, by and large, sexy campaigns aimed particularly at young people. They have to be aimed at young people because the customers are dying and new ones must be recruited. Research shows that the younger the customer, the more likely he or she is to remain a smoker for the rest of his or her life. That is why so much money has been spent on advertising campaigns, not just in Ireland but throughout the world. It is obvious that these advertising campaigns are successful, otherwise the industry would not be wasting its money on encouraging young people to start smoking.</P>
    <P>In the lead-up to the budget, ASH made a submission to the Minister for Finance in which it sought an increase of 2 per packet of 20 cigarettes and a number of speakers here were very supportive of that. It is one area with which I have a certain difficulty, although I support the Minister on any initiative which aims to reduce the number of smokers. From an early stage he has shown great interest in the problem and is very keen to try to reduce the numbers of people dying from tobacco-related illnesses. The submission from ASH stated that price is a very important factor and that a significant price increase would be the most cost-effective way of dissuading young people from starting to smoke. It would also be an important trigger to make current smokers contemplate quitting and would help dissuade ex-smokers from returning to the habit.</P>
    <P>While it may be difficult to argue with that, we must be conscious of the fact that smokers are addicted to a substance and have to have 20, 30, 40 or 100 cigarettes per day. There are all types of smokers. They are not all young or rich people; there are many old and poor smokers, male and female. It is unfortunate that in many cases, these people spend a substantial amount of their disposable incomes on cigarettes. Had the Minister decided last Wednesday to increase the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 2, enormous hardship would have been created for many people, particularly the elderly. We cannot ignore this. We must be realistic in the measures we take in this House and we need to look at bigger picture. I acknowledge the interest and tremendous contribution of ASH and the lead it has given in seeking action on smoking and promoting a healthier lifestyle.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this Bill, is trying to make it as difficult as possible for young people to get their hands on tobacco products. Many of our secondary schools have an ambivalent approach to smoking. There is probably not one school in <Col N="1161" /> Ireland which allows smoking inside the gates of its buildings, but if one drives by a school youngsters can be seen lighting cigarettes as soon as they come out the gate. School principals should take a much stronger line than they do. At present the out of sight, out of mind approach is prevalent &ndash; once they do not see the students smoking they do not mind. Many secondary students feel under pressure to smoke. In many cases it can be the in thing to do. We must target secondary school pupils and encourage them to take a different route. The damage, the difficulties and the hardship that lie ahead, if they decide to smoke full time, must be explained.</P>
    <P>It is equally important, from the Minister's point of view and that of the tobacco industry, that we do not take measures that may drive the whole thing underground. In that case the results achieved would be the opposite of those we want. The measures we introduce should be realistic. We are anxious to change people's habits but nevertheless we must acknowledge that people have been smoking cigarettes for years. Old habits die hard and people will not give them up easily. We must make it as difficult as possible for young people to obtain tobacco products, whether we target shopkeepers, school teachers or parents. That is the message we must send out and any measures we take must endeavour to achieve this.</P>
    <P>ASH has called for a ban on the use of vending machines to sell tobacco products. I disagree with that for a number of reasons. The Minister indicated in the Bill that he will allow vending machines to be used in licensed premises. That is only right as people are given a licence to sell intoxicating liquor and we put our trust in them to carry out that duty. As we are showing faith in them in that regard, surely it is not too much to ask that we show the same faith in them not to sell tobacco products to people under the age of 18. Most public houses do not welcome children after 7 p.m. or 7.30 p.m. anyway.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of security in licensed establishments, it is preferable for publicans to use vending machines in their premises. The drinks trade is very much aware of the Minister's intentions and it is grateful for his change of heart regarding the banning of cigarette machines in public houses. It is intended that vending machines are in close proximity to the counter where they will be under the watchful eye of staff. It is important that they take their responsibilities seriously in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not ready for a ban on smoking in pubs, but it is important that the health authorities insist on proper ventilation in pubs. Some publicans were afraid that the Minister would impose a ban on smoking in pubs. Many people only smoke when they go for a drink. These are habits that we should try to encourage people to change but an overnight ban would not be a nice way to treat people. It may be something we should contemplate in future but at the moment <Col N="1162" /> a ban on smoking in pubs would be a non-runner as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred earlier to the Minister's decision to sponsor a snooker event earlier this year. I confess that most people in Kildare were very sorry to see the Benson &amp; Hedges snooker tournament leaving Goffs. It was a very welcome sporting event in the calendar and was supported by local people throughout Kildare. However, this is the price we will have to pay if we are serious about implementing the new legislation and placing a ban on cigarette advertising. There is bound to be some pain and any group suffering that pain will react and put pressure on Members to change the rules a little. It is vital that the House promotes a healthy lifestyle, particularly among young people.</P>
    <P>This was the first year that the snooker moved from Goffs and it only moved up the road to Citywest. The Minister agreed to sponsor it and while it is important to support events, particularly in the first year, it is questionable whether that was a proper use of resources &ndash; I would say it was not. While the event receives an amount of television coverage, other anti-smoking campaigns would be much more productive. I encourage the Minister to look at other ways of spending money on encouraging people not to smoke.</P>
    <P>We see cigarette butts strewn about on every street. In recent years a number of people were fined for throwing butts out their car window and people have to be made aware of their responsibilities. Smokers do not have a right to throw the butt anywhere once they finish a cigarette. It is important that we continue the anti-smoking campaign but, from a litter point of view, it is imperative to tell smokers what to do with their butts. I congratulate the Minister on his health strategy. It is obvious that much consultation went into it and while we are not expecting overnight success, it is the way forward in the long-term.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Lowry. We will have ten minutes each. We have all heard the question about whether people who died from cancer smoked. The next question asked usually refers to drinking habits. Relatives of people on their death bed say that their loved one is paying the penalty for smoking by having a hard death. There are two eminent doctors in the Chamber and I am sure they have experienced such scenes over the years.</P>
      <P>The attitude to smoking has changed in recent years. I applaud people who no longer allow others to contravene the no-smoking regulations on buses, in restaurants and so on. The message is getting through. Ten or 15 years ago people smoked everywhere and nobody said anything. It was acceptable on soap operas on television and I am sure cigarette companies played a part in that by sponsoring programmes. I see a resurgence of smoking on television again and this needs to be addressed.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be exceptions to the provisions on passive smoking. Strong lobby groups must not be allowed decide the nature of legislative proposals. If there are to be exemptions the law will not work. The law must be fair throughout and strong lobby groups should not be in a position to influence the Government to ensure their interests are not affected by legislation.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong if the legislation only impacted on those selling cigarettes, that is, shopkeepers. Too many rules and regulations govern the conduct of business in this country. This legislation is concerned with the licensing and selling of cigarettes. Shopkeepers must have a responsibility in this regard but they should not become a soft touch with their businesses being adversely affected to the point of closure by, for example, being penalised because an under age person procured a cigarette from them. This has happened in the Western Health Board area where young children, acting on behalf of the health board, have procured cigarettes. Traders were caught and were badly affected. Many were elderly and had been running businesses for many years. The major multiples were avoided in favour of targeting small businesses. I hope this will not happen when this Bill is passed. If it does it will defeat the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-smokers attending meetings often emerge with a strong odour of cigarettes on their clothes. It indicates that the health impact of cigarettes on non-smokers must be very severe. I favour banning cigarettes in pubs and night clubs. Earlier this week I attended a function in Leinster House where people were dancing while smoking. That must be stopped as it is dangerous, not only from <Col N="1164" /> a health point of view but also because it may cause injury to others.</P>
    <P>Smokers must remember that a cigarette is a drug. Cigarette smoking must be tackled like any other drug. Not long ago people sold cigarette cartons at a reduced price on the streets of Dublin. The full rigour of the law must be brought to bear on them to ensure they cannot engage in such activities again. The courts should be empowered to deal with them in a like manner to drug dealers. Selling cigarettes to young people is similar to inducing them to smoke. They become addicted.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that millions of pounds every year are spent treating drug addiction and drug related illnesses. Many elderly people smoke a cigarette at night to enable them relax. It is wrong to price them out of the market. They should be educated to realise that what they are doing is wrong. Everything should be done to help and encourage them, including the use of medication. I welcome the provision enabling the Minister divert taxes raised from the sale of cigarettes to the medical card scheme.</P>
    <P>Not enough is being done in schools. Every day 12 year olds take up smoking. Education policy should be directed at primary schools in the first instance. Doctors, nurses and cancer patients should be employed to show young school children how cigarette smoking can impact on their health, both when they are young and later in life. More money should be spent in this area.</P>
    <P>Cigarette companies are like drinks companies and we are too soft on them. They get away with murder. Every year in this country thousands of people lose their lives because of the effects of smoking. Rather than penalise smokers with price increases the companies should be targeted. The Government knows well how to do that and it must be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally welcome the Bill. The primary aim of the Tobacco Control Agency, which is part of the overall health promotion strategy, is to improve the health care system and to encourage the concept of illness prevention rather than cure. This can only be viewed in a positive light. The agency is aimed at discouraging young people from starting to smoke. However, if the Bill is passed the agency will have to be charged with the task of enforcing other measures, some of which may be too penal and have adverse consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the preventative health dimension of these measures, there can be no contesting the fact that all aspects of health care will remain central to this and the next Government. The Government badly needed a strategy catering for the basic health care needs of the population and not a strategy that was geared to camouflage, contain or cure existing ills. Encouraging people not to begin smoking is an initiative aimed at curtailing and reducing the likelihood of ill health. Unfortunately, however, I have seen at first hand in my constituency of North Tipperary the suffer<Col N="1165" /> ing people have endured because of the Government's refusal to address the serious problems that already existed in the health system. While I am relieved that, at long last, something constructive has been done, I find it shocking that the Government waited four and a half years to introduce its health package. We live in a democracy where the ongoing pleas of our citizens for help with their health problems were callously ignored by the Government. Now that a strategy has finally been put in place, we can only hope that our health system and the overall health of our people will begin to improve. Apart from the emergency measures announced recently, we need to think independently and imaginatively about our attitudes to preventative health care.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy document has much to say about the inequality of access to care in the existing system. l wish to highlight a related issue which is not always heard or fully understood. I refer to the glaring inequality where poorer members of our society are the least healthy. A recent ESRI survey illustrated that the people who get the best treatment services are the ones who complain the most about the system. The report stated that those with incomes of £450 a week and who have the best access to services because they are privately insured patients are the ones who profess to be the most dissatisfied with public health services. The people who have to depend on the public health system &ndash; those earning less than £200 a week &ndash; expressed the least dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental flaw in this analysis because those who are most in need are not able to express their worries and dissatisfaction to people in power. They are silenced by the dominance of the middle-class voice of those conducting the research and those who constitute the majority of respondents in the reports. That is a sad but true reflection of how a great deal of our research is compiled, utilised and translated back into a system that reproduces inequality.</P>
    <P>While the life expectancy rate in Ireland has increased in recent years, evidence suggests that it is not increasing as fast as in other EU countries. The section entitled &ldquo;Understanding Our Health&rdquo; in the new health strategy document lists the categories in our society where the number of premature deaths is still disproportionately large. In Ireland, premature death is more likely for males than females and the mortality rate for men between the ages of 15 and 64 is two and a half times higher for unskilled workers than for those in professional employment. These findings, coupled with the points raised in the ESRI report, indicate that the problem is not only one of access to care, but rather a lack of information and education about health matters in general. Based on my experience of the system, that is the crux of the matter and it is a particular problem for less well-off members of our society. People who have less access to education are more likely to practice lifestyles that are damaging to their overall well-being and smoking is chief among these, <Col N="1166" /> accounting for over 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year.</P>
    <P>More information is needed to discourage our young people from engaging in lifestyles that result in ill-health. To that end, they need access to more information on the dangers of smoking. Parents in the less well off sectors of our society cannot afford to buy glossy overpriced health magazines to get the information they need. They depend on the Government and the health care system to advise and guide them. To date, the Government has failed miserably in this regard. A first step in the right direction, which I welcome, is the establishment of the social, personal and health education programme. This is to be extended to all primary and secondary level schools by 2005. Health boards are to have more contact with schools, universities, workplaces and voluntary organisations dispensing information on smoking, alcohol abuse and exercise related issues.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about some aspects of the Bill, particularly those which deal with in-store advertising and displays and those which affect moderate smokers in society. Banning displays completely will have adverse effects on another vulnerable group in our communities, local shopkeepers. The Bill proposes that a retailer selling tobacco products must do so from a closed container or dispenser which is not visible or accessible to the public. That, I believe, is going overboard. Shopkeepers will be required, under this Bill, to treat as contraband a product which is legal in this country and provides revenue to the Exchequer. A recent survey conducted in Ireland by a company whose product is devised to help people give up smoking produced results which state that tobacco displays are not a factor in relation to people deciding to smoke or purchase tobacco products. If this is true, removing displays will not eliminate the problem of projecting smoking as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and attractive to our young people.</P>
    <P>I fear this part of the Bill will have severe effects on small shopkeepers who are a vital part of local communities. There will be a major cost factor involved in removing the current display areas and these will then have to be refurbished at a further cost if the retailer is to install the type of dispenser proposed in the Bill. I have been approached by many shopkeepers who feel that their financial existence, which, in many cases, is on a week to week basis, is being further threatened by the abolition of tobacco displays. Up to now, a shopkeeper renovating his or her property received much needed financial assistance from the tobacco manufacturers in return for putting their products on display. If displays are abolished, this financial support will no longer be available to them.</P>
    <P>In general, people do not pop down to the large supermarket for a packet of cigarettes; they go to their local small shop and, in the process, they usually pick up other items. They probably meet a neighbour and engage in conversation. These <Col N="1167" /> traditions are part and parcel of our culture and give a sense of community to people. Moreover, if local retailers can no longer display or sell a packet of cigarettes at a reasonable price, they will probably lose out on other sales that are vital to their survival in business. Clearly, this is of great concern to them. The ban on the retail sales of a pack of less than 20 cigarettes will inevitably reduce the display areas in shops.</P>
    <P>Restricting and reducing the advertisement and display space will probably discourage some young people from smoking. However, abolishing displays completely will put in jeopardy many small shops which have already suffered considerably this year in the wake of the foot and mouth disease restrictions and the downturn in tourism revenue. Local retailers are an essential part of the fabric of our rural communities and I am concerned that small shopkeepers will be destroyed financially as a consequence of excessively restrictive measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We should also bear in mind that large numbers of people smoke in moderation. Will these people feel outlawed and discriminated against by the more restrictive measures in the Bill? We have to accept that many people enjoy the occasional cigarette on social occasions and do not suffer ill-effects from their habit. I encourage the Government to promote, in every way possible, measures that provide the necessary information to those who need it most in an effort to encourage preventative health care practices. I also urge the Minister to consider deleting lines 17 to 21 on page 27 of the Bill and to give the small independent retailer a lifeline in these financially challenging times. The imposition of these restrictions could very well have the opposite effect to what the Minister intends and could increase the level of illegal trading of tobacco products on the black market.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001. I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on the measures he and his colleagues are putting in place and on the priority he has placed on this issue. I attended the recent conference on the tobacco industry at which the question of whether to prosecute or otherwise was discussed. I welcome the fact the Minister raised the age at which it is legal to purchase cigarettes from 16 to 18 and I applaud the ban on advertising and sponsorship that was introduced in July 2000. I also welcome the fact that all patches, gums, sprays and tables will be made available, free of charge and on prescription, to medical card holders. I fought strongly for this through my work with the joint committee. I probably would have argued that this could have been extended to incorporate everyone, but I assume that anyone intent on pursuing these kinds of treatments can avail of the drug repayments scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> I am glad the Minister has provided £1 million this year to assist in the enforcement of the existing legislation and I welcome the introduction of the legislation before us. I wish those who will be involved with the office of tobacco control every success. I accept they are starting out on what will be a difficult road but I am sure they will have great success in their endeavours. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work done by ASH Ireland and the other support agencies to bring us to this point where we are debating Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was extremely important that the Minister stated last night that he regards the battle against tobacco as &ldquo;one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium&rdquo;. The Minister is not merely uttering words, he has already put measures in place and taken action. As he is aware, the Joint Committee on Health and Children has also prioritised this topic and has spent the last number of years researching it. That is probably why I am more exercised about this subject than people outside might feel I should be. As Deputy Ring stated, children should be shown the effects smoking can have and the serious illnesses it can cause. People who have suffered such illnesses have appeared before the joint committee. Some of them, suffering from serious medical conditions, were brought in with oxygen tanks attached to their wheelchairs. One individual was upset by the fact that two of their four children smoke. I agree it is important to use people who have suffered serious illnesses as role models, but this alone will not provide an answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>The joint committee travelled far and wide and invited people from afar to address us in order to widen our knowledge of tobacco and, more particularly, the influence of the tobacco industry on young people. I am not a smoker and I have never been overly keen to take up the habit. However, that is not to say that I do not respect a person's right to smoke, particularly when they respect my rights in return. This issue has a great deal to do with competing rights, namely, the right to smoke versus the right to a smoke-free environment. I will outline later the effect tobacco smoke can have on children and the fact that they can fall victim to sudden infant death syndrome and many diseases from being subjected to smoke. The House recently debated legislation on the right to life. It has been proven that the right to life of babies who are subjected to tobacco smoke in their homes is being interfered with. In my opinion that matter must be addressed and greater emphasis must be placed on it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about young people who are being tricked and cajoled into taking up smoking. As Members are aware, it takes approximately 20 young people to take up the habit each day just to replace the 7,000 or so people that smoking kills each year in Ireland. In other words, 20 people need to start smoking each day in order to maintain the current number of people who <Col N="1169" /> smoke. I do not know if that message is getting across. Do people really believe that, despite the agony and serious consequences alcohol can inflict, their children are better off if they are smoking rather than drinking? These individuals somehow excuse smoking as inconsequential, recreational or benign. When people are young, they do not believe they are going to die. We can see the effects of underage drinking every day. Consider, for example, the number of young people who drink, get into their cars and are then killed in accidents. However, it is not so easy to see the effects of smoking and many people who smoke do not know that their chances of dying from certain diseases are increased by 50% as a result of their habit.</P>
    <P>I will comment later on the issue of underage drinking which is another of my hobby horses. I must say at this point, however, that it is vital that we continue to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking and this must extend to regulating the clever promotional activities in which the tobacco companies engage and which are aimed at young people. We must ensure that we put more supports and programmes in place to help people who wish to give up smoking. We need to accept that smoking is often not an isolated event and that there are people who do not wish to smoke but are caught, perhaps in a social context, in a position where they are injured through passive smoking. We also need to ensure that, to protect the young and non-smokers alike, we enforce rigorously existing legislation and, more particularly, the legislation before us. Many people complain that the country is being inundated with legislation, only a fraction of which is ever enforced. The latter will remain to be seen in respect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Why can we not dispel the feeling that smoking is not really that much of a problem when the statistics quoted to the members of the joint committee in respect of deaths associated with smoking are so stark? These statistics are not new, they began to emerge in the 1950s and 1960s. Why do those who know people who fight for each breath they take begin to smoke? Why do people who are informed by their doctors that their life span will be seriously reduced if they do not stop smoking continue to smoke? Why, when evidence shows that the leading cause of preventable illness in the country is smoking, are the incidences of smoking, particularly among young boys and even more so young girls, again on the increase?</P>
    <P>I suppose it comes down to the clever way the industry goes about encouraging young vulnerable people to start smoking. A certain level of peer pressure is applied and a torrent of money is used to advertise the product in so many ways. We must recognise that smoking is highly addictive. I particularly enjoyed the performances of the industry representatives who appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Each of them, obviously in the interests of avoiding litigation, refused to say that smoking is addictive. When I asked what they thought con<Col N="1170" /> stituted addiction, they informed me that some people think they are addicted to chocolate, others to computers and others to golf. In that context, some people might believe they are addicted to smoking.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the same money invested in advertising by the tobacco industry is not put into developing patches and other devices to try to wean people off cigarettes. When I asked the industry representatives about the amount of money they spend researching the effects of their product on consumers or the research they carry out in respect of the number of people who try to give up each year, not too many promising facts were forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is important that smoking should be seen as addictive. If tobacco was not a highly addictive substance, we would not be here debating this Bill and perhaps those 98% of people who try and fail to give up smoking each year would not be looking to us, as legislators, to help them. It is a sobering thought that only 2% of those who try to give up smoking each year actually succeed.</P>
    <P>I am not sure but I believe the Bill stipulates that the ingredients in cigarettes can be made public but that they do not have to be listed on packets. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position. When smokers actually see listed on a packet the 600 additives included in each cigarette and discover that 4,000 chemicals are released in every lungful of smoke they inhale, will it have an impact? Will the ever increasing nicotine content &ndash; which is more addictive than either heroin or cocaine &ndash; ensure that those 80%, the vast majority of smokers, who say they would like to give up will forever be condemned to absorbing all the carcinogens such as ammonia, cadmium, benzene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead, mercury and so on? Will they be condemned to a life expectancy below the European average significantly related to the smoking factor?</P>
    <P>We learned through our committee meetings that cigarettes are responsible for a large percentage of cancers, for a high fraction of coronary disease and stroke and for practically all lung disease. It is now believed that stroke is as preventable as heart disease, that people can pre-empt a stroke in the same way as they pre-empt a heart attack. We are faced with a pretty awful situation and the fact that all these diseases are preventable makes it scarier.</P>
    <P>The world almost closed down during the recent BSE and foot and mouth crises. Nothing could move across the Border without being checked. Foot and mouth disease is a serious issue for farmers and their animals but it will not kill 7,000 people each year. We were able to pump all our resources into dealing with that crisis and rightly so in terms of agriculture. Try to imagine 7,000 people dying each year as a result of BSE or foot and mouth disease &ndash; it is quite scary.</P>
    <P>The fact that nicotine is a stimulant that affects the brain, the heart and the nervous system and <Col N="1171" /> gives a short-term &ldquo;fix&rdquo; similar to other drugs should not undermine the long-term medical effects of smoking &ndash; the short-term gain is very much replaced by the long-term pain for most.</P>
    <P>Many shopkeepers feel threatened by the Bill. They say one in three people who come into their shops do so principally to buy cigarettes but that 25% or more of their turnover arises from sales made to the same clientele. Of the 14 European countries, Irish consumers are the third highest spenders on tobacco. That is a huge percentage of retailers' business and I fully understand their concerns but if we are honest, what we are trying to do is reduce the number of young people who take up smoking and, through time, ultimately reduce substantially and-or eliminate the use of tobacco products. One can understand why retailers feel threatened by the Bill in the context of the bigger picture. Everything possible should be done to ensure communication between the Office of Tobacco Control and retailers in an effort to allay their fears. Ultimately, what we are trying to do is eliminate the sale of cigarettes. I was in America recently and I watched how they dealt with the issue of hiding the product and the banning of advertising. It seemed to work in a very practical way. This Bill will have serious financial implications for retailers. They feel health and safety issues will come into play in terms of where the product can be placed. Those issues need to be addressed with the retail industry.</P>
    <P>We will be faced with the same problem as the alcohol industry when it comes to proving a person is over 18 years of age. Young people now have the option of purchasing an ID card which costs £5. I do not believe they should have to pay for it. We must ask whether we need mandatory ID cards. It is a big question that raises the whole big brother issue. I know shopkeepers who have asked people their age. These people can get very stroppy and become very offended when asked for ID, especially if they are 22 or 23 years old. Our culture has to change. People in America under 25 years of age do not go anywhere without some form of identification. We must look seriously at ways of proving a person is over 18 years of age. Perhaps we could seek the co-operation of those approaching that age. Should we introduce mandatory ID cards? I would like to hear the Minister's views on those points at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked how many people will check retailers. Will it be health board officials and-or the Office of Tobacco Control, or both? How many people will be involved? The harder we are on the legitimate retailer the greater will be the likelihood of contraband. I welcome the recent seizure of cigarettes which has put a huge dent in somebody's operation. I would point out to retailers that a recent study indicated that only 8% of children who bought cigarettes had been asked for identification. We are trying to control the sale of cigarettes to young people and to discourage them from taking up smoking at a young <Col N="1172" /> age. I fully support the right of a person of 18 years to smoke. I hope retailers will work with the Government to ensure that choice is available to young people and that they are not sold cigarettes at eight, ten, 12 or 14 years of age.</P>
    <P>We were shown many of the clever things which retailers are doing in America. They send out many subliminal messages in their advertisements &ndash; one could send away tokens from cigarettes and receive a free pair of flip-flops which, when one walked across the beach, left a camel imprint.</P>

      <P>It happens in America. That is the type of messages they are sending out.</P>
      <P>The tobacco industry is constantly trying to put a stronger nicotine content in their cigarettes. A study in New Zealand found that a packet of ten cigarettes contained more nicotine than a packet of 20 thus encouraging people to buy more of them. People buy low tar cigarettes thinking they are better off, but they are not. Other people think they are not at risk when smoking cigars but there is 20 times more ammonia and five to ten times more cadmium in cigars.</P>
      <P>I have strong feelings about passive smoking and the difficulties it can cause for children. Passive smoking causes children to suffer from respiratory illnesses, asthma and ear problems. Smoking during pregnancy contributes to miscarriages, smaller babies, prenatal and cot deaths.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Ring's comments regarding the price of cigarettes. My father smoked a pipe and enjoyed it very much. He once said that if tobacco prices went over £1 he would give up smoking the pipe. When the next budget was announced tobacco was increased to £1.01 and my father put the pipe away and never smoked it again. He was like a demon for about three months but he survived. He is one of the 2% of people who can succeed in giving up cigarettes, and price can play a part in this. People can choose to smoke but they cannot choose to give it up, which is sad. I do not wish to appear to be totally against smoking. What we need to get across is how serious are the repercussions of smoking so people can make a knowledgeable choice and not find themselves trapped into an addiction which they cannot escape.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and I urge the Minister to work closely with the retail industry, whose members will probably be most affected by the legislation, to ensure that it is implemented as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The last speaker said it was probably draconian legislation and there are cer<Col N="1173" /> tainly elements that could cause concern. There is particular concern among retailers. A heavy emphasis is put on retailers but it should be remembered that retailers in country shops are probably put to the pin of their collar to survive economically. They sell cigarettes, but the Minister is now putting an onus on them to ask people their age.</P>
      <P>It is easy for a Government to ban something and say cigarettes cannot be sold to people under 18 years of age. However, I defy the Minister to take a random group of eight people of various age groups and judge which of them is under and over 18 years of age. We are now asking the shopkeeper to make that decision. That puts the retailer in an unfortunate position. The concept of mandatory ID cards frightens people but one cannot do certain things without having some means of identification. The consumers and retailers will probably accept other aspects of the legislation, such as the impositions regarding registration and so forth.</P>
      <P>The primary concern of this legislation is to stop young people smoking. Why do they start? It is because smoking is regarded as cool. In the 1940s and 1950s when smoking became extremely popular, the health factor was not considered. In the 1960s, when I was under 18 years of age, it was considered almost adventurous to smoke a cigarette. We did not enjoy them at first but after a while we did. We were young and there were no scares about health. Today there are such scares but young people still smoke because they regard it as cool.</P>
      <P>In the Western Health Board area, a survey of more than 200 people discovered that in Roscommon the number of small retail shops that sold cigarettes to people under 18 years of age was as high as 97%. In many cases the people concerned were as young as 14 years of age. The survey was carried out by the environmental health section of the Western Health Board. We have to be concerned about young people smoking because statistics show that people who start smoking at 15 years of age will probably die more quickly of lung cancer than somebody who starts smoking in their 20s.</P>
      <P>We are adopting the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; approach of legislating for changes to advertising and promotions but how much of this problem comes down to parental responsibility? In many cases parents would be extremely concerned if their child decided to get a motorbike. They would probably take a dim view of it. However, to what degree is there parental responsibility in ensuring that their children under 18 years of age do not smoke? That is probably where much of this problem will be dealt with eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frightening to see what smoking has done on a global scale. The cigarette companies are brilliant at advertising and marketing and particularly at conveying the subliminal messages mentioned by the last speaker. Look at the image projected by &ldquo;Marlboro Man&rdquo; to young people. In the UK alone, more than £100 million is spent on <Col N="1174" /> advertising cigarettes. Restrictions on such advertising were recently introduced there. I do not know what is spent on advertising in this country&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>When England imposed restrictions on advertising, it set a target of reducing smoking by 2.5%. We have set the ambitious target of reducing smoking from 31% to 20%. Targets must be set but how was the 11% arrived at?</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have highlighted the illnesses caused by smoking. The World Health Organisation report issued on 11 December estimated that 1.2 billion adults smoke, putting up to 700 million children at risk. Other speakers referred to the effects of passive smoking. In that regard, everybody makes a choice about what pubs they will patronise. Some pubs have good air conditioning and extraction systems to remove smoke. There is concern about passive smoking and there have been changes in the law regarding smoking areas in restaurants. Now there are attempts to impose non-smoking areas in pubs. I do not know how we can tackle this problem. Eventually, it will probably come down to pubs having to acquire good air conditioning systems if they want to attract their target clientele.</P>
      <P>The restrictions being introduced by the Minister appear to be laudable but I wonder how practical they will be. There is concern among retailers for whom selling cigarettes is a prominent part of their business. They are prepared to register their premises but the Minister is putting them in an extremely difficult position by expecting them to make judgments about age. We are great for passing legislation. It is easy to think about what restrictions we will introduce to deal with various matters but sometimes we do not empathise sufficiently with the members of the public who have to implement the legislation. If the Minister wishes to ensure the ban will be effective and that a person under 18 years of age cannot buy cigarettes in a small shop in rural Ireland, he will have to introduce some type of identification card rather than put pressure on the person behind the counter to ask a 21 or 22 year old whether they are over 18 years of age. The Minister must do that to achieve his objective.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the objective of an 11% reduction in smoking is not sustainable. Where did the 11% figure originate if, on the basis of banning advertising, the UK expects to secure a reduction of only 2.5%? Was the figure plucked from the air as attainable?</P>
      <P>I am curious about the discussions the Minister might have had about RTE. RTE has been constrained by the Government with regard to finance. A large element of funding for Formula One racing is generated by advertising but if the Minister wants RTE to retain Formula One racing he will have to black out the cigarette advertising on hoardings and the like. How successful has the Minister been in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> My final observation relates to the decision not to extend the availability of medical cards to deserving people. People who smoke tend to be from the socio-economic category that does not qualify for medical cards. They just miss out on qualification. The Minister, despite trying to improve the health of the nation, did not include the incentive of providing extra medical cards. It would be an important component in this campaign. I have met people who have four children with asthma but who cannot get a medical card because they are over the income limit. Their spouse might work an extra day each week and they are penalised by not qualifying for a medical card. I also see other decisions in relation to the allocation of medical cards which I deplore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy McGahon and thank Deputy Finucane for allowing me share time with him. The figures prove that almost 7,000 people die from smoking related illness each year. Some 31% of the population smokes and between 35% and 40% of younger people is smoking before they reach the age of 18. That is an alarming figure and the kernel of the problem. The number of young people smoking is the real worry, particularly for parents. I smoked as a young person, at a time when it was trendy to do so, and my friends were smokers. Giving up was one of the hardest things that I have done. Although I have been off cigarettes for 15 years, I still occasionally yearn for a cigarette. It is clear that smoking causes serious addiction.</P>
      <P>Smoking causes over 90% of lung cancers and chronic bronchitis. The incidence of smoking is most common among young men between the ages of 25 and 30, particularly in the lower socio-economic groups. The heaviest smoking rate is found among married people, particularly those between the ages of 35 and 49. The percentage of deaths caused by lung cancer in Ireland has risen from 9.7% in 1970 to 21% in 2000. That is a startling figure and one we must investigate. Some 30% of boys between the ages of 15 and 17 smoke. Some 80% of all smokers become addicted between the ages of 14 and 16, highlighting the need to combat under-age smoking. These smokers will have a 50% chance of dying from a tobacco related illness. Tobacco is one of the greatest causes of preventable death. There are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide. By 2025, it is estimated that figure will rise to 1.6 billion. One half of all patients admitted to St. James's Hospital in Dublin have smoking related illnesses. The cost of running such hospitals is huge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We address an essential piece of legislation here tonight. However, the way we go about implementing the legislation is another worry. Independent grocers and retailers are extremely concerned with the legislation, seeing it as draconian. These businesses have been under huge pressure and this legislation makes it more diffi<Col N="1176" /> cult for them to operate. I met with representatives of retailers just last week and they cited several main areas of concern. One of these relates to the storage of tobacco products on their premises. They wanted me to emphasise that the legislation is inoperable in this area. Cigarettes would have to be hidden away in shops. There cannot even be a mark to distinguish different brands. Nothing can be displayed in the shop. Retailers have said it is impossible to run a small business or shop, where staff might change or young family members help out, in this way. This proposal is unworkable and must be addressed. Retailers have enough trouble running their businesses at this time. Many smaller businesses are under pressure from big supermarkets and this legislation is driving another nail in their coffin. I urge the Minister to look at this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people, particularly younger people, not to smoke. It is hard to stop people smoking if they wish to and indeed people cannot be forced to stop. The health risks are clear but this Bill should also take account of independent retailers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>That I come from Dundalk might lead people to believe that in some way I would oppose this particular legislation. I do not because the evidence is stark. My difficulty concerns the continued reluctance by all parties in this House to address the major problem that affects children in this country, namely, the problem of drink. I charge the House with gross hypocrisy on the serious issue of drink. There is huge duplicity involved. We have expressly forbidden television and newspaper advertising for cigarettes. Yet every ten minutes the youth of Ireland are offered a variation on the theme of &ldquo;Are you going for a Harp?&rdquo; or &ldquo;The goodness of Guinness.&rdquo; We are turning a blind eye to the misery that drink produces. There is not a family in the country that has not felt the ravages of drink. Deputy Keaveney spoke about the blandishments of clever cigarette advertising. She was talking about the United States because there is no cigarette advertising here. All the clever advertising comes from the vintners and the drinks distributors who have cynically targeted youth. The Minister of State, as a medical practitioner, must be aware of this. If he is not, then his medical colleague in Mayo, Dr. Michael Loftus, is fully aware of the danger that drink wreaks on young people.</P>
      <P>Some of the proposals in this Bill are laudable but are unenforceable. What kid who wants to buy a packet of cigarettes will not get a bigger kid to buy them for him? Children will not be denied access to cigarettes. I shed no tears for the small shopkeepers who sell cigarettes. I was one myself, at one time. Snipe could not be fed on the 10% profit made from cigarettes &ndash; such a profit is not viable.</P>

      <P>That argument does not stand up. However, I charge the House with hypocrisy in refusing to deal with the major problem and the major drug in this country, namely, alcohol. The blandishments of the breweries and of the people who make a very handsome living out of the tragedy that many families suffer, should be restricted.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I underline that more people are smoking today than ever before. Recently in Dundalk, 80 million cigarettes &ndash; the tip of the iceberg &ndash; were, thankfully, seized by customs. Many people, particularly in Border areas, are millionaires because of the level of trade and the profits that accrue from smuggling cigarettes. It is folly to believe that if one closes the door on legitimate production of cigarettes, people will turn away from them. They will not because of the rewards and profits that come from smuggling cigarettes internationally.</P>
      <P>Not for the first time I have spoken of the dangers of alcohol and the hypocrisy in this House in refusing to address the problems that awful drug brings to people. I commend the Minister and agree with what he is doing in relation to cigarette smoking, but I wish he would show the same alacrity in dealing with the problem we in this House refuse to recognise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials for bringing this comprehensive measure before the House. There has been a number of delays in getting the Bill here giving rise to concern in some quarters that it may not reach the Statute Book in the lifetime of this Government but I am happy to see it here today. I am even happier that the Minister intends to have All Stages passed and the Bill enacted by Easter 2002.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill in an important area of public health and it is intended to be one of the flagships in the Minister's legislative programme. The actions proposed under the Bill, including putting the existing Office of Tobacco Control on a proper statutory footing with statutory powers of enforcement, are an important component of the Government's long-term health strategy recently announced and generally warmly welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smoking kills 7,000 Irish people each year. Tobacco is an addictive poison and any measures to reduce the number of victims, willing or unwilling, must be positive. I would like to make a number of general remarks and will then comment on some specific aspects of the Bill with a view to outlining how its effectiveness might be improved. Incidentally, I question whether the Office of Tobacco Control, which was so recently established, which is doing a very effective job and which secured a considerable measure of public recognition under that name, needs a change of title as proposed in the Bill. The Office of Tobacco Control, as it is known, is a regulator. Its primary purpose is to enforce the law relating <Col N="1178" /> to the sale and use of tobacco products. It is not there to educate the public or assist or enlighten it; it is there as an enforcer. If it is to be an effective enforcer, it must have teeth.</P>
    <P>Taxation of tobacco products at a much higher rate and their removal from the consumer price index are two issues to which the Government will have to return despite the reluctance of the ICTU &ndash; one of the social partners &ndash; to address these issues. Conclusive research undertaken for the Office of Tobacco Control by MRBI shows that tax increases, significantly higher than the rate of inflation, are a disincentive and deterrent to smokers and would be smokers. Furthermore, the research shows strong public support, even among smokers, for penal taxation on tobacco. This public support cannot, and should not, be ignored.</P>
    <P>Much detailed work will be done on Committee Stage but I would like to see the final version of the Bill setting out a clear timeframe for the implementation of its various sections. An equally clear timeframe for the formulation and implementation of the necessary regulations arising from the Bill's provisions is also important. The reason these timeframes are important is to ensure there is no slippage in the implementation of these vital public health measures due to pressure from vested interests connected with the trade in tobacco production in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Some of the material sent to Deputies is indicative of the resistance the Minister's proposals are generating in the main. They are neither coherent nor compelling but I am sure there will be more to come. As ASH Ireland, the anti-smoking organisation, points out, smoking kills six times more people in Ireland each year than road accidents, work accidents, drugs, murder, suicide and AIDS combined. These are all matters of serious public concern, and rightly so, but so is smoking. I counsel the Minister not to be deflected from his chosen course.</P>
    <P>Discretionary compliance with statutory or other measures designed to modify, alter or permanently change public behaviour has repeatedly been proved to be ineffective in effecting major and lasting change. Regrettably, a measure of compulsion is often required to make change stick. Littering and illegal parking are cases in point. Action in relation to tobacco production, distribution, sale and use is no different &ndash; some would argue that it is more difficult. The Bill would be considerably improved if the health boards and the tobacco control agency were compelled to enforce the legislation. It should not be discretionary on their parts, as proposed in section 6. Additionally in this respect, section (10)(1)(<i>h</i>) should be amended to provide that health boards should be obliged to comply with all reasonable directions of the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the establishment by the agency of a register of retail sellers of tobacco products. Some of the points I made about enforcement are also relevant here. If it is left to <Col N="1179" /> the discretion of the individual retailer to register with the agency, there will, undoubtedly, be difficulties of compliance and enforcement. Human nature, not to mention other matters, being what it is could require an expensive field force and considerable time to ensure all outlets are properly licensed. We do not need another expensive State compliance and collection operation for registration of licences.</P>
    <P>We should learn from the example of the TV licence and its associated problems. In terms of administrative efficiency, section 37 should be amended to provide compulsory disclosure of relevant information to facilitate compliance. What is needed is a requirement on manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, cash-and-carry outlets and other distributors of tobacco products to furnish to the agency all relevant information, distribution lists, customers, delivery locations etc. for the express purpose of establishing and maintaining the retailers' register. This is not an enormous obligation and if objections are to be raised on the grounds that the information is commercially confidential, providers can be assured that the information would be held and used only by the agency for the maintenance of the register.</P>
    <P>On the pollute and pay principle, there is no reason why the State should be put to unnecessary expense when there is a cheap and efficient administrative solution readily available. There is a need for greater clarity in the definition of the term &ldquo;to advertise&rdquo;. It is necessary to provide a greater degree of certainty as to what precisely the offence is, who exactly is guilty of it and when it occurs. What precisely is &ldquo;continuing offence&rdquo;? Does the term &ldquo;to advertise&rdquo; mean to commission, publish, broadcast or display advertisements, or does it mean all of these?</P>
    <P>Although it is a difficult and much disputed matter, we also need greater clarity in respect of indirect advertising, such as product placement, Formula 1 racing and the disputed area of brand stretching, which tobacco companies describe and defend as simple product diversification away from tobacco. The use of the Internet to conduct research on young people who will be future smokers needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>All forms of financial support by the industry of educational, sporting and cultural bodies and events, especially bodies providing services to children and young adults, should be banned without exception. However, it is not that simple given the means used by the tobacco industry to gain access to and exert influence on leaders and key decision makers. It is particularly used to influence policy in our universities and business schools.</P>
    <P>Smoking in all enclosed public places should be banned completely. Exceptions should be dealt with by way of ministerial regulation. The proposal in the Bill appears to be inadequate and discriminates against people who are not employed in the various employments specified in section 46. The Statute of Limitation should <Col N="1180" /> be amended to allow injured parties sue after a particular time period. It should also be made an offence for persons under 18 to sell tobacco products. If this is not criminalised as it is for adults, minors will be used extensively by criminals, smugglers and other peddlers of stolen products. More importantly, it would render it more difficult for under-age smokers to secure illegal purchases through legitimate outlets from sales assistants in their own age group. The onus to ensure tobacco is not sold to minors should be at least as strong as that relating to the sale of alcohol to minors.</P>
    <P>The Minister should retain the right to publish the composition of tobacco products without recourse to the High Court. He has an important responsibility for public health education, quite separate from his functions as regulator. He must be allowed to educate people about the dangers of tobacco in an unfettered manner. Anyone familiar with the revelations in the report Towards a Tobacco-Free Society regarding components of tobacco products will be truly horrified.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of some aspects of the Minister's speech, particularly relating to under-age smoking. He expressed his concern about the increasing level of smoking among children and access by under-age persons to cigarettes. This is a serious problem. In the past, there were shops in every town, particularly those near where young people congregated outside schools and so forth, in which some reckless shopkeepers were selling cigarettes singly. That was a serious problem in some of our towns, including my own town, and something of which we should not be proud &ndash; it was a disgrace. That was not today or yesterday, but 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of the risk to children. They are particularly at risk from passive smoking. As they grow, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke significantly reduces their lung capacity. I agree with my friend from County Louth that smoking is one problem and alcohol another, but both seem to go together. It is very popular for young people in pubs to have a half pint or pint and a cigarette at the same time. It is sad that they cannot enter a public house and take a drink without having to smoke continually.</P>
    <P>I was at a 21st birthday party last week. A lady asked me if the price of cigarettes would go up in the budget. I said that I hoped they would and asked the lady what she would do. She said &ldquo;I am nearly off them&rdquo;. The next day and the day after, because I was in the company of smokers for an hour or two, the smell of smoke from my clothes was unreal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing time with Deputy John Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> and Deputy Ulick Burke. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise manpower issues in public health medicine. It is the only Irish medical speciality in which senior trained practitioners are appointed at a specialist rather than a consultant grade. This <Col N="1181" /> reflects the relatively low priority accorded to population health and preventative medicine in the health system. Public health physicians are unique in the Irish health system. Foregoing rights to private practice, they go through the rigorous training physicians in other disciplines go through, yet they are appointed at specialist level and do not have opportunities to progress to consultant grade. The public health specialist grade should be retained as it provides a useful model for other specialist areas, but the Minister should look at the public health area where preventative medicine is very important. More public health consultants would strengthen the safeguards needed in that connection.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to speak not just as a legislator and parent but as a retailer and I hope I can suggest some improvements to help the Bill achieve its public policy objectives. To a large extent retailers will form the front line in enforcing the legislation and it is important that they are able to implement those measures efficiently and effectively. There has been an acceptance by retailers of the need to address the public health issues concerned with tobacco and smoking. While tobacco products account for a significant share of many retailers' businesses, there is acceptance that it is neither possible nor desirable to repel the international trends in favour of the control of tobacco and the reduction of tobacco consumption. There is also recognition of the trend in political and public opinion regarding tobacco products and public health. It is important to look at the position of retailers under this legislation. It cannot be said that tobacco companies play any beneficial role in community life but the same cannot be said of shops, which occupy a significant role in the life of communities around the country. Many of them will be adversely affected by this Bill as the decline in tobacco sales will affect their turnover and it is important the new measures do not place any additional financial burdens on those shops in the context of such pressures. Tobacco companies must cover the increased costs incurred by retailers.</P>
    <P>The legislation contains express provisions dealing with retail of tobacco products. It also rightly provides for probing of tobacco companies, as it addresses issues beyond the sale of tobacco. The Bill gives the new agency the power to demand information from the tobacco companies on the ingredients of cigarettes and health records, which will rightly strike at the heart of their business. Tobacco companies have been a little less than fulsome in recognising their responsibilities to consumers when it comes to the impact of their products on public health. They have treated consumers outrageously while playing cat and mouse with various investigations which were initiated to study the addictive elements in their products. Tobacco suppliers have refused to attend public hearings in the Oireachtas, which is outrageous. The tobacco companies have been condemned for their mar<Col N="1182" /> keting practices, which are aimed at attracting new young smokers. It is disturbing that as countries in the West introduce stricter controls on tobacco, these companies are moving their activities to countries where public health debate is not as advanced and controls are lax. I hope the Minister deals with tobacco companies, as this Bill fails in that respect.</P>
    <P>Retailers will play an important role in implementing these measures and from my experience as a retailer I have queries which I hope the Minister will address. How will registration work and what will it cost? Retailers need this important information. Will the authorities step up enforcement of the law against traders selling cigarettes on the black market? The recent success in Dundalk is welcome but we need a positive and prolonged State initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision of products in a closed display which is not accessible or visible to anyone other than the retailer or staff, surely the main priority is to ensure that the products in the unit are not visible to the public. There are very few places in a shop where a display unit can be located and made invisible to consumers. Placing products under the counter is not practical and will raise health and safety concerns as well as security issues. The Minister must examine this matter. If the objective is to remove products from display, it should be achieved without putting any burden on retailers. The cost of removing shelving and products from sale following the enactment of the Bill will be considerable for retailers but in most cases the tobacco companies have paid for these units to be installed in shops. If they were happy to put them into shops they should be equally prepared to pay for their removal. Provision for this should be made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I seek some specific amendments on Committee Stage. Registration is covered in section 37 and that cost should be borne by the tobacco company and not the retailer, while the period of registration should be for five years or longer. Regarding section 43 on display, the legislation should permit the construction of secure units which do not display the products but which may be visible to the public. Such units should be permitted to be masked with advertisement for any products excluding tobacco products. The essential point is that no tobacco products or marketing should be evident to the public.</P>
    <P>The cost of removing and making good any existing display cabinets should be borne by those who paid for their installation in the first place &ndash; the cigarette companies. The cost of constructing the new cabinets might likewise be borne by the manufacturer of the products. Retailers selling tobacco products should be allowed to sell nicotine replacement products and to advertise such products. Regarding section 43, there should not be any distinction between the sale of products by vending machines and those in shops, as retailers must not be placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-<Col N="1183" />à-vis</i> publicans or clubs. The restrictions which apply to retailers should also apply to all self-service sale products. Sections 37 and 46 refer to prosecution and there could be stronger penalties for the sale of cigarettes from unlicensed outlets or by individuals and for the seizure of contraband. Individuals should be precluded from selling cigarettes other than from premises; they should be prevented from selling cigarettes on the black market. A bona fide defence for retailers should also be strengthened when false identification is presented.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill and I commend the Minister. I agree with the public policy objectives the Minister has identified as being central to the legislation and I support his zeal to curb under age smoking. It would take very little for the Minister to make this a perfect Bill and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will take account of my genuine concerns about the impact of the Bill on the retail trade. I know retailers are not the Minister's primary target but their responsibilities when it comes to the sale of tobacco must be respected. The Minister should accept that many of the suggested measures can be achieved without necessarily imposing additional costs or burdens on local shops. We are now looking at a new dimension in selling cigarettes and business people will have to accept that. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

Some of the figures in the Minister's speech were frightening, for example, the statistic that smoking related illnesses lead to 500,000 deaths each year in the European Union, 7,000 of which are in Ireland. Illnesses caused by smoking include lung cancer, heart disease, strokes, emphysema and bronchitis. I do not know why it is so difficult to transmit to young people that cigarettes are a serious danger, but it is amazing that so many of them smoke. I do not mean to be sexist, but as I walk from my hotel to this House each morning, I am staggered by the number of young women, most about 20 years of age, who smoke while walking by. Perhaps I do not understand because I do not smoke, but it is strange that so many people need to have a cigarette early in the morning. There is something seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have referred to advertising and sponsorship, but I feel that we should trust people to make their own decisions. People are entitled to smoke if they want as we live in a democracy, but they are not entitled to blow smoke at my face and into my lungs. We cannot ban smoking entirely, however. Many surgeons will not deal with smokers as they do not wish to treat those who will not help themselves. As many of my <Col N="1184" /> friends are heavy smokers, I can sympathise with those who wish to give up the habit, but cannot do so. It is an addiction that is difficult to overcome, even if one is aware of the dangers and of the fact that a frighteningly high percentage of smokers will die from the habit.</P>
    <P>We are very fussy about many aspects of planning and I think we should extend this diligence to making it compulsory to have air extractors in buildings where people gather in large numbers. It has been pointed out to me that they cost too much, but I think it is outrageous that one should be enveloped in a cloud of smoke, unable to see. Medical practitioners have told me that air extractors cannot guarantee proper health and safety standards, but it would be better if smoke was dissipated to prevent it from entering our lungs. It is a burden for non-smokers to be in a smoky environment. I find, as I get older, that my tolerance for smoke is decreasing. There was a time when I would not have cared if people smoked in my presence, but now I am inclined to ask them to wait until I am no longer in their company. It is difficult not to be agitated when someone is enjoying a cigar and blowing the smoke out strongly.</P>
    <P>While I welcome any Bill that tries to reduce smoking, I have certain worries, especially having met shopkeepers who sell cigarettes. I am delighted to be able to defend good businessmen like my colleague, Deputy Perry. It is not right that they are almost criminalised for selling cigarettes. To have to hide tobacco products from view, perhaps under the counter, is a great inconvenience for those who are not supple enough to bend their backs constantly. I do not know if it is right that shopkeepers should have to hide cigarettes in cupboards, as I am not sure if the slogan &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; applies to cigarettes. It is difficult for shopkeepers to have to hide their products.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that crimes are committed by those who break the law. It is those who buy cigarettes under age that we should make suffer, not those who sell the product. I made a similar point in this House &ndash; that we should ensure that those deceiving publicans are held responsible &ndash; during a discussion on under-age drinking. Not even Solomon himself could confidently tell a 17 year old from an 18 year old. I know from coaching football teams that young men who are physically big can look far older than they are. I remember seeing a 16 year old drinking in our clubhouse one evening. I was sure of his age as I had taught him some years previously, but the bartender was flabbergasted when I pointed out his error. The 16 year old was so big that he could have played for the Irish rugby team. The onus should be on those breaking the law, not on those behind the counter who may find it difficult to tell how old a customer is.</P>
    <P>If we are to insist on criminalising publicans, we should have a stringent identity card system. The argument is often made that it is easy to print false identity cards, but at least it gives shop<Col N="1185" /> keepers something to go by. We cannot blame a shopkeeper if one of his assistants sells cigarettes to an under-age acquaintance while he is out of the shop. No member of my family is involved in the grocery trade, so I am entirely impartial on this matter, but we cannot expect shopkeepers to judge a customer's age when Solomon himself could not do so. I suggest that those buying cigarettes or alcohol should be taught that responsibility comes as they get older. I would not jail them, but it is important that they be made carry the can.</P>
    <P>It is hard to compete with the fact that one-third of under 18s smoke. It is difficult to tell young people not to smoke, but we need to highlight the health implications of smoking. It may be too late to argue against smoking when people have become addicted as they will have to learn the hard way that cigarettes damage health. It is only when one meets surgeons and cardiologists and hears about the need to ban cigarettes that one realises that many innocent people suffer as a result of an addiction to smoking. Some people are simply unable to stop smoking, possibly due to genetic factors. I do not know what the cure for this is, but I would like to see less smoking. A certain glamour seems to be attached to smoking, flicking the ash and looking sophisticated. There is a certain amount of truth in the old joke that God would have given us chimneys if he had intended us to smoke as it is hard to understand how lungs benefit from the inhalation of smoke.</P>
    <P>I question the seriousness of this Bill because before the budget we had been led to believe that packets of cigarettes would cost an extra 1. Psychology is quite important before a budget, but the great psychological build-up this year resulted in a total fiasco on budget day. We will have to increase the price of cigarettes if we are to be serious about stopping young people from taking up the habit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill. The House has passed much legislation regarding the economy and other aspects of society. However, this legislation is important. I agree with Deputies Perry and Browne who suggested that we should not be afraid to amend the Bill in whatever way is necessary. Once passed by the House, the legislation will have to be comprehensive to we ensure that we deal with this problem as efficiently as possible, that the legislation can be policed and that we can encourage people not to smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to declare an interest in this issue as my father worked for the Irish Heart Foundation. Part of his job was to visit schools and organisations to show a reel of film which explained to the young and the old the effects of cigarette smoking. I assisted him in giving out leaflets which informed people of the damage smoking causes to one's health. At that stage, the Irish Heart Foundation was doing great work in this area and took a positive approach to the manner in which it told people that smoking was bad for <Col N="1186" /> their health. That was not a popular message at that time and not many people tried to explain the downside of smoking.</P>
    <P>Few statistics were available at that time. There was a general feeling that smoking was bad for one's health and a film was available which could be viewed in a public place or in a school. The Irish Heart Foundation carried out this work which, although it did not make a significant impact, conveyed the basic message that cigarette smoking was bad for one's health.</P>
    <P>The contents of the film portrayed in stark terms the effects of smoking on the lungs. If one wished to be convinced not to smoke, this was the film to watch. I commend the Irish Heart Foundation for its work in this area, for the manner in which it approached this problem, for collecting money at church gates and doing the donkey work which ensured that the information was at least placed in the public arena and supported by broad sketchy statistics. The foundation got the message across in basic terms. This film brought home to me that education is the way out for those who wish to give up smoking, be they under-age or addicted smokers. One must provide people with the information and assist them after they have been educated about the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I used to smoke, but have not done so for the past 20 years. However, like everything else, one smokes in a phase. One takes it and one leaves it. One is touched by the information one receives on the issue and decides whether to stop smoking. However, some people become addicted to smoking in the course of this process and will try everything to give up cigarettes. They will try to give them up for Lent, they will use patches or other methods advertised in newspapers. These people are convinced of the argument that they should give up smoking cigarettes, yet they cannot do so. Education must be linked to some method of giving up smoking and Government finance should be made available to fund such a method. We must keep pressurising people to kick the habit and understand what they are doing to themselves.</P>
    <P>Part of this process is to educate people as to the nature of smoking related illnesses and how one can be hospitalised as a result. Many illnesses are identified as smoking related, such as heart bypasses of which Deputy Browne has personal experience. There is a way out of this problem. Smoking impacts on the health service. Therefore, money spent in a positive way by informing people, getting them off cigarettes and encouraging them to adopt a more active lifestyle without smoking would benefit the economy. We should invest in educating and informing people of how they can give up smoking. We should show them the impact of smoking on themselves, on their family members and on those with whom they sit in a pub or in a social context. We will make an impact on this issue if we consistently educate people and fund a way out for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Reducing the number of smokers will impact on the health service as it will not be clogged up by people suffering from smoking related illnesses. It has been pointed out that 500,000 EU citizens die every year from illnesses directly related to smoking. What impact is this statistic having? It is known that 7,000 of those who die each year are Irish citizens. How many times does one have to tell people that they will die as a result of this habit, yet the message does not sink in or they cannot stop smoking?</P>
    <P>We may be able to take a lead from the drink-driving advertising campaign on television which is having a major impact on people's psyche and making it clear that drinking and driving is not on. Similarly, smoking is not on. Perhaps we should go down the route of delivering a stark message, as was the case in the Irish Heart Foundation's film. We should give people more than just the figures which can go over their heads. We should show them something visual which will impact on them and remain with them and convince them to give up smoking in their own interest and in the interest of their families, friends and those with whom they socialise. The Government must adopt this approach. Passing this legislation will not be sufficient on its own.</P>
    <P>All Members received the revealing and informative statistics from the tobacco-free society group. However, we must inform those outside this House. The statistics indicate that, despite the advertising and other efforts of successive Governments, the use of tobacco products has increased substantially in a ten year period. The message is not having the desired impact on the public.</P>
    <P>The failure to make an impact in discouraging smoking must be measured against the impact of cigarette advertising. The highly profitable tobacco industry is dominated by a small number of people. Some of the subsidiaries of world-wide companies are based in Ireland. I will not mention their names, but they contribute to encouraging young people to smoke and to encouraging people who already smoke to continue doing so. Wherever they are allowed to advertise, they present smoking as being sexy and cool. These advertisement usually feature young people, particularly women, to get the message across. This issue must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The only means a government, country or population has of tackling this method of advertising is to hit it at source and prevent it. One will not win the battle in terms of the advertising, as the money is on the side of the companies which are making huge profits. We have limited funds at our disposal, therefore, legislation which can be enforced is the only other tool we have to stop people smoking, or to encourage them not to smoke. If this legislation is well thought out on Committee Stage it will tell the tobacco companies they are not allowed to continue to advertise and promote their products in the way they have been doing. We can tell the tobacco companies to <Col N="1188" /> stop advertising but to contribute to informing and educating people as to how bad cigarette smoking is. Putting a small notice on the side of a packet of ten or 20 cigarettes is not sufficient. A smoker simply opens the packet and takes his next cigarette. Tobacco companies must be made to contribute to the education of the general public and to the coffers of the State so that the education process can be paid for and people persuaded to stop smoking.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have been taken against cigarette companies in the United States. We should approach the problem from the other side and insist that tobacco companies contribute to what the Government is trying to achieve. If we start this process we might have a reluctant partner in the tobacco companies but we will be able to begin to educate the public as to the dangers of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>I was once a member of RGDATA and, like Deputy Perry, I sold cigarettes. Big cigarette companies come into small shops and make it possible for the shopkeeper to revamp his premises. They present the retailer with counter displays and with attractive magazine display units. They invest, not in the retailer but in their products. The tobacco distributor will then own all the shelving and display material in the shop and will ensure his product is seen first by the customer when he comes in the door. Regardless of how many brands are displayed on the shelf, the distributor's product will stand out among the rest. If tobacco distributors are prepared to make that kind of investment, they must be forced to make an investment in the health of the country by ensuring that people know the damage cigarettes can do to their health.</P>
    <P>This legislation should reflect our pursuit of the tobacco companies and the fact that tobacco smoking is bad for us but it should not criminalise retailers for having cigarettes on their shelves. More than 31% of shoppers come into small shops to buy cigarettes. They may then buy a newspaper or some grocery items. A case has been made for identification cards as a means of combating under-age drinking. Identification cards are essential. It is extremely difficult to tell if someone is under 18 years of age. A shopkeeper or publican will almost always overstate a young person's age. This is happening in public houses and off-licences throughout the country. We are now adding another layer of bureaucracy to be administered by shopkeepers. Identification cards are essential because it is impossible for a small shopkeeper to tell a young person's age. If the legislation is to be successful everyone who buys cigarettes must be required to show ID. The shopkeeper can then refuse to sell that person cigarettes. It is not acceptable to put the onus on the publican or shopkeeper. They can do the job but they cannot complete it and it is not fair to place this responsibility on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>An agency is to be established to monitor these regulations. We seem to be creating layer upon layer of bureaucracy. There are several Govern<Col N="1189" /> ment agencies which could easily take on this responsibility. If a small shopkeeper sells a sandwich over the counter he will have a health inspector on his doorstep to ensure that the regulations are observed. If he has a wine licence he will be visited by some other inspector. He will almost certainly be visited by a third and fourth inspector for some other purpose. The Bill will add another inspector to this list. I am in favour of minimising bureaucracy and of making life easier for the shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>Further costs must not be added to those the shopkeeper already bears. Whatever cost is associated with implementing this Bill should be borne by the tobacco companies and not by the small grocer. Most small shops are run by family units who are pushed to the pin of their collars to meet their financial obligations and cannot afford further costs. I ask that any costs involved in the implementation of the Bill should be borne by the tobacco companies and not by retailers.</P>
    <P>Tobacco products should not be immediately visible when a customer goes into a shop or public house. The customer must go into the premises with the intention of puchasing the product and not be influenced to purchase by what he sees when he goes in. The product must be kept out of sight, although not hidden under the counter. This issue is outlined in the submission made by the Irish Retail Newsagents Association. The product should be put to one side but accessible to the staff. We must consider the logistics of placing cigarettes so that they are not immediately visible and the customer must ask for them. There are many tobacco products and it is not practical to keep them hidden under the counter. That would be an Irish solution to an Irish problem and would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Vending machines should also be placed out of sight but they should not be hidden. Let us not push tobacco onto the black market to be peddled at a low price, and let us not push people into buying tobacco on the black market because it is not acceptable to buy it openly. Tobacco will be sold. More than 31% of people who go into small shops do so to buy tobacco. Let us keep tobacco in the open so that it can be dealt with. Let us not ban vending machines but place them in positions where they must be sought out and are not immediately obvious when a customer goes into a shop. Let us not drive tobacco onto the black market and create a problem which will haunt us in the future.</P>
    <P>We must reconsider the register of tobacco retailers and the penalties associated with this issue. We must also reconsider the Bill's provisions regarding vending machines. The sooner the legislation is put into effect the better but we must not be afraid to change some of the provisions in the Bill on which submissions are being made. This will give us a better Bill following its consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins. I welcome the Bill in prin<Col N="1190" /> ciple &ndash; it is a positive development &ndash; but I have some serious reservations about its contents.</P>
      <P>I could not help but notice that a number of speakers openly admitted that they were reformed smokers. It is always said that those who are most vehemently against smoking are reformed smokers and we heard a few of them this evening. It should be noted that the State promoted smoking 30 or 40 years ago in an effort to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis. People were encouraged to smoke to protect themselves from the disease when it was rampant in Ireland. We should be conscious of that. It may be said that the State has also come full circle and is now itself a reformed smoker. Perhaps that is the reason the legislation is being introduced now.</P>
      <P>The legislation will cause huge problems for niche markets within the tobacco industry. I am speaking from a very parochial point of view as I am concerned about over 100 jobs at Villiger cigars in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon. This establishment is part of a niche market and huge difficulties will ensue for small indigenous companies such as it. There will be no problem for the big names such as Benson &amp; Hedges and Silk Cut, which have established names and labels, but the niche markets will experience huge difficulties in the future and jobs will be lost. We should be conscious of the possible loss of Irish jobs due to the introduction of this legislation. We would be naive to ignore that aspect.</P>
      <P>In a few years, with the development of genetic engineering, new products with reduced tar or reduced detrimental effects will come onto the market. Smokers who are trying to give up or who want to give up to improve their lifestyles will not be aware of these products because of this legislation. Some mechanism will have to be introduced so that people can be made aware of new products which reduce the risk for those who cannot give up cigarettes. I foresee huge difficulties with the implementation of this legislation, which is one of the most archaic Bills I have seen. I hope, as Deputy McGuinness and Deputy Perry said earlier, that any changes or amendments made to it will endeavour to make the legislation practical and easily implemented. This would benefit everybody and meet the objectives that have been set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 43 of the Bill deals with the point of sale of tobacco products. Under this legislation cigarettes will have to be stored under the counter, which raises issues of health and safety and of costs for small retailers. It is estimated that it will cost a retailer approximately £6,000 to make these changes. Rather than having the retailer face the brunt of that, the tobacco companies should contribute. This point was made eloquently by previous speakers. A system should be brought in whereby the products remain where they are, covered up and where the public cannot see them, but the retailer can still access them. These cost implications will otherwise make the legislation difficult to implement. In practical <Col N="1191" /> terms it makes no difference whether the cigarettes are behind the counter or under it. If people cannot see them they will not know where they are. A small change such as this could be of benefit in terms of implementation.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Bill deals with the registration of tobacco retailers. It is still not clear whether there is a once-off registration or an annual charge. It is important to clarify all these issues so that implementation is as easy as possible for retailers and everyone in the industry. If we make it difficult for people, the whole industry will be forced into the black market. A few days ago 80,000 cigarettes were found in County Louth and this is happening on a regular basis. Subversive organisations import cigarettes to fund themselves.</P>
    <P>It will be mandatory under the new legislation for the tobacco control agency to remove offenders from the register for three months on conviction, regardless of any mitigating circumstances. There is no discretion allowed in this regard. In similar legislation concerned with alcohol, the courts make the final decision on matters of under-age drinking. The arguments for and against can be balanced, but that is not the case here. This legislation is much more draconian than the corresponding alcohol legislation. We should reconsider this and introduce practical measures to allow for an appeals mechanism which takes mitigating circumstances into account. We should also consider introducing the national ID card and the national age card. There is no point saying that a person must be over a certain age to purchase alcohol or cigarettes, with severe penalties in place, while not supporting the retailers by giving them the opportunity to distinguish between people who are breaking the law and those who are not.</P>
    <P>Who will be an authorised officer? Will it be the tobacco control agency, the local health boards or a combination of both? This falling between two stools has arisen in the past in relation to other enforcement issues, where there are two separate organisations involved. It will lead to another tier of bureaucracy. Responsibility should be given to one organisation or the other, not to every organisation under the sun. The Bill should make reference to clearly defined roles. I compliment the Minister on his action on vending machines. A case was put forward about vending machines and the Minister listened and ensured that those measures could be easily implemented. I ask that the same type of measures be taken with regard to the controversial issues surrounding this legislation, to facilitate its implementation and to ensure it succeeds in its objective. If this legislation goes through as it stands, it will result in an immense cost for retailers and will not succeed in its objective.</P>
    <P>Huge difficulties will surround the issue of advertising. All forms of advertising will now be banned, with certain exemptions, probably very <Col N="1192" /> few, which will be regulated by the Minister. However, Marlboro, for example, now has a clothing label. Will that be banned? What are the implications of this? That is just one example and it is certain that every other manufacturer will do exactly the same thing. Marlboro saw this coming and launched a range of clothes, with its own distinctive label, to promote cigarettes. Jordan cars display the logo Buzzing Hornets. Will advertising of this type now be banned? It does not show the emblem of the cigarette manufacturer, yet it is clearly distinguishable that Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes are being promoted. Issues such as this need to be considered; complications ensue when companies branch out into the clothing sector. This advertising needs to be looked at. The whole issue of these companies branching out into the clothing sector can lead to a complex situation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at this situation and ensure that practical measures are implemented to ensure the success of this Bill.</P>

        <b>: </b>On 11 September this year an atrocity carried out by a terrorist organisation killed upwards of 4,000 people in the United States. As a result, the US President and Administration unleashed a ferocious war on Afghanistan to hunt down those who are allegedly responsible. They are spending billions of dollars in that pursuit.</P>
      <P>In the year 2001 in the United States 40 times the number killed, tragically and disastrously on 11 September will also be killed &ndash; but by lung cancer. According to research some 90% of the cancers which will kill between 160,000 to 170,000 people are caused by smoking.</P>
      <P>What is the view and action of the political establishment in the United States? In the course of the presidential campaign some $8.3 million dollars was accepted in campaign contributions from big tobacco firms. World-wide, tobacco is an enormous business and accounts for some $40 billion of sales in the US every year.</P>
      <P>Tobacco corporations are ruthless and, in the pursuit of profit they have destroyed millions of lives. They cheated and lied about the nature of their product and covered up the destructive capacities of this product. Long after they knew cigarettes were both addictive and highly destructive of people's health they continued to portray them as healthy and an activity to be envied and indulged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is long overdue that strong action be taken in this State. In the initial part of the four and a half years I have been a Member of this House I greeted with derisory comments the pathetic attempts by the Government under the cover of the budget to pretend to do something about coming to grips with the smoking crisis here. A price increase was seen as the way to deal with this severe addiction and killer of people. It was a pathetic excuse and merely a cover to raise revenue. On a number of occasions I remarked how incredible it was that the Government was allegedly taking this measure of upping the price of <Col N="1193" /> cigarettes in the interests of health, but was not bringing in a prohibition on cigarette advertising at that time.</P>
    <P>I am very glad things have changed and tobacco advertising is now banned. The whole question of alcohol advertising is now brought into very sharp relief by this debate. Alcohol is also a powerfully addictive drug and a killer of a significant number of people. It is a very destructive drug when abused. It is still allowed to be portrayed as a healthy, sexy, attractive kind of pursuit and it is high time the Government tackled this substance and considered a similar ban on advertising.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see section 38 proposes to ban cigarette-shaped confectioneries. A number of years ago I remonstrated with a local manager in my own area on this issue. They are attractively designed sweets which are freely sold to children. It is appalling that the manufacturers were cashing in subliminally on the advertising for cigarettes and getting children to buy them. This type of confectionery conditions young children towards smoking at a later stage and becoming addicted to nicotine. I fully support the measure of banning such confectionery.</P>
    <P>Repression is clearly not the answer to the health crisis caused by smoking. Addiction is a very difficult thing to kick and we have to be sympathetic to those who are addicted. It is by education, information and encouragement in new and imaginative ways that we can convince those addicted to nicotine to give it up and to prevent new generations from becoming addicted.</P>
    <P>In socially deprived areas where unemployment and poor housing has been a problem, nicotine addiction can exist at a very high level. In these areas cigarette smoking and addiction seems to be a compensation for the many difficulties and traumas people in such areas are experiencing. To overcome current addiction levels and prevent the spiralling of the problem we must promote a better life where people have choices, a better environment and healthier outlets.</P>
    <P>The jobs of those working in the tobacco industry must be considered and, as with the armaments industry, it is a question of finding and planning alternatives. As cigarette consumption falls, I hope alternative employment will have begun to emerge.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not appear to refer to Internet advertising, and this will have to be teased out on Committee Stage. In the US, it is said that in ten years Internet sales will account for one fifth of the annual sales of some $40 billion of cigarettes. Before I came into the House I went on the Internet and found many sites advertising cheap tobacco products. This could be a problem and we must begin to address it.</P>
    <P>We should take a close look at the record of the big tobacco corporations in the Third World, <Col N="1194" /> in particular. It is an appalling fact that as the consciousness is being raised in the western world about the health effects on tobacco, they are directing more and more resources to making millions of poor people in the Third World addicted to their products. That is a shocking abuse by these companies.</P>
    <P>Retailers and small shopkeepers should not be branded in any way. I do not favour prohibition and it is necessary to have outlets to cater for this. If they have legitimate claims on how the legislation should be implemented they should be heard provided they do not reduce the effectiveness of what is envisaged.</P>

      <P>It is probable that at some stage in our lives we have experimented with cigarettes. Until 20 years ago I smoked 80 cigarettes a day. When considering cigarettes and tobacco there is a need to look at what is happening in the world of tobacco advertising. The Minister is to be complimented for earlier action he took to deal with the problems of cigarette advertising. While his decision last year on a snooker tournament to be held in Dublin was criticised in the House, it was in the best interest of the wider public.</P>
      <P>The number of people affected by nicotine related health problems is startling and frightening. Every day in this country, approximately 20 people die from tobacco related diseases, be it cancer, heart condition, strokes or whatever. If a similar number was to die on the road every day there would be public outrage. In view of this, the Minister is correct to deal with the dangers to the public of tobacco and tobacco related products.</P>
      <P>Young people have always been subjected to pressures of various kinds, especially the peer pressure to smoke. The education system must address this. Schools, especially at second level, must explain to students the dangers and health problems that can be caused by smoking and the consumption of tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Under-age smoking has always been a problem in this country. People are inclined to smoke in their early teenage years. It is highly desirable that an end be put to this. I hope the new regulations, when implemented, will help to prevent people from becoming addicted prior to being in a position to make a conscious decision on whether they wish to smoke to the detriment of their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarette promotion has had a powerful impact, especially on those who sell products. For example, the tobacco industry has always been the main sponsor of Formula One racing. It must be better explained to the public that while Formula One racing might depend on sponsorship <Col N="1195" /> from the tobacco companies, it could well survive without it.</P>
    <P>The need for education is vital. For example, there is a need to consider replicating the powerful television advertisements on the carnage on our roads resulting from road traffic accidents in terms of warning people of the dangerous impact tobacco can have on their health. This could be very useful.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with aspects of the lobbying by retailers regarding the problems they envisage with the legislation. They argue that if they sell cigarettes to an under-age customer who appears to be 18 years or older they could lose the right to sell cigarettes for three months and be convicted of an offence. On Committee Stage there may be a need to consider the penalties with a view to allowing the courts have more discretion in these matters. The problem retailers will face on incidental aspects, such as displays and other facilities, can be addressed with a common sense approach by all sides. I expect that aspect to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We all understand the damage tobacco can inflict. For example, there is the environmental damage arising from passive smoking to which we are all subject every day, be it in pubs, on buses or whatever. There is a need to consider tighter controls on smoking in public places. Some argue this would adversely affect the pub trade and other businesses but I do not believe this will happen.</P>
    <P>People are becoming more conscious of the need to protect their health. It is too late for those who realise that their health problems were self-inflicted through smoking or the consumption of alcohol. There is a need for greater education on the dangers of smoking and this should be especially directed at young people. A visit to any hospital in the country or consideration for our friends who have been the victims of smoking will demonstrate the dangers of smoking. It is futile to ask why they did not stop.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for advertisements that make a frightening impact. The warnings on cigarette packs are insufficiently strong on their own, especially as far as young people are concerned. I appeal to the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, to embark on an education programme in second level schools to educate students on the danger of engaging in tobacco smoking and other substance abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing his time. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I compliment the Minister for introducing it. The impact of tobacco smoking on public health is frightening. There are approximately 7,000 deaths from smoking per <Col N="1196" /> annum in Ireland and life expectancy among smokers is lower than the norm.</P>
      <P>The increased levels of smoking among young people, especially in and outside schools, is frightening. Greater efforts are required to educate children, especially in secondary schools, and to discourage them from taking up smoking. It is usually in school that the problem begins, when students may smoke because they believe it is cool to do so.</P>
      <P>Young children are especially at risk from smoking and from the effects of passive smoking. Families who socialise are at risk, as are those who frequent pubs. Many pubs do not have adequate ventilation or extractors and in such cases the impact of passive smoking can be especially severe.</P>
      <P>While some people smoke to relax, for example, when they are in cars, addiction can take hold, especially among the very young. Although advertising is no longer so extensive, it is still very prevalent in motor racing where advertising hoardings are on prominent display in television broadcasts. I knew the owner of a small pub in a rural area who never smoked but, when he became ill and went to his doctor, he was told he had the appearance of a man who smoked 40 cigarettes a day. That man died from lung cancer, despite the fact that he never smoked a cigarette in his life. All public houses should have some form of extractor so their customers need not be affected by passive smoking. That is just one example. Our hospitals are filled with people suffering from smoke related illnesses, including lung cancer, respiratory complaints and heart disease. There would be many empty wards were it not for the fact that so many people smoke. We would also have a much healthier and fitter people if we could get rid of tobacco addiction. I had two brothers much younger than I, both of whom had bypass operations as a result of smoking related diseases. Thank God I did not need such an operation, having smoked very little in my younger days. It is a salutary experience to be told by a surgeon that if one had not been a smoker, one would not have had need of his services.</P>
      <P>The Garda is to be complimented on its recent success in intercepting massive quantities of smuggled cigarettes intended for sale on our streets and particularly to our young people, with consequently increased addiction to smoking. Cigarette smoking is, in my view, a bad habit. The experience of attending meetings and functions in smoke filled rooms is most unpleasant, particularly for non-smokers. I am glad that smoking is now prohibited on much of our public transport services.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Other speakers have referred to their personal situation as smokers or <Col N="1197" /> non-smokers. Unfortunately, I continue to smoke, despite my best efforts to give it up. A number of speakers have referred to the question of discouraging young people from smoking. I welcome the provisions of the Bill in that regard. We have to address the issue of peer pressure and how to get the message across in primary and secondary schools with regard to the damage to health and fitness which is caused by smoking. My father has told me of his experience in national school some 65 years ago. His teacher explained the damage caused by smoking by lighting a cigarette, blowing the smoke through a clean handkerchief and pointing out the deposits of tar on the handkerchief as an indication of the accumulated damage to a person's lungs as a result of regular smoking. However, we do not seem to be getting the message across to our young people, as evidenced by the number of them who are to be seen smoking in pubs, discos and night-clubs throughout the country on any Friday or Saturday night. Obviously, it is very difficult to sell the message as to the damage which smoking causes.</P>
      <P>During the debate, I thought about what it is that triggers the smoking habit in a person. Perhaps it is being in a certain place at a certain time and in an environment in which the product is available. Some people become very seriously addicted to the point where they can barely survive without a fag. Their rights also have to be accepted if they are not interfering with the health of others, in terms of passive smoking. Perhaps, as a result of this and other relevant legislation, smoking will become socially less acceptable over a period of time. However, in the case of a certain percentage of people who seriously depend on smoking, some leeway should be allowed to them.</P>
      <P>Retailers are very worried about this Bill and the existing rules and regulations and perhaps they have a case to make. The introduction of a national ID card for people under 16 should make it easier for retailers to deal with the situation. The permitted extent of cigarette advertising has been substantially reduced in recent years on television, billboards and elsewhere. Tobacco advertising in relation to sporting activities such as motor racing and snooker has also been phased down. Despite all that, young people appear to be subject to the same pressures as before and the message is still not getting across. If it requires a compulsory programme in primary and secondary schools to get the message across, then that route may have to be followed.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's proposals and, without having anything particularly new to add, I will at least help to keep the Minister in the House until 10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of previous speakers. However, I was most <Col N="1198" /> impressed by that of Deputy McGahon which, I accept, drifted somewhat from the substance of the Bill. While the Deputy placed on record his strong support for the legislation, he took the opportunity &ndash; I also intend to do so &ndash; to remind us that while we are now making ongoing and perhaps more effective efforts to reduce tobacco consumption in this country, we do not appear to be making the same strides in respect of the problem of alcohol consumption. There is no doubt that smoking causes many deaths and the statistics speak for themselves in that regard. The Minister indicated that almost 7,000 people die here each year as a result of smoking related illnesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the frightening statistics relating to alcohol consumption. I regret to say that, as a society, we appear to be moving increasingly towards a situation where alcohol is becoming the only form of entertainment for people. It is disappointing that Irish people appear to be unable to enjoy themselves or partake in entertainment of any sort without imbibing alcohol. While the statistics relating to smoking are dreadful &ndash; the figure of 7,000 deaths per annum is inexcusable &ndash; and there is an undoubted need to tackle and, hopefully, remedy the problem, the statistics relating to alcohol consumption are equally bad. It is not simply a question of lives being lost &ndash; I am not in a position to provide figures with regard to the number of deaths per annum caused by alcohol consumption &ndash; we must recognise that the level of misery being generated in families as a result of excessive alcohol consumption is a problem of enormous proportions which requires more serious attention from the Government. It is politically correct to refer to the evils of smoking and to put in place strong legislation to try to reduce the numbers of people who smoke. However, it does not seem as politically correct or as popular to invest the same kind of efforts into tackling the scourge of alcohol. I hope the Minister of State and her colleagues in Government, in their remaining months in office, will make renewed efforts to place the problem of alcohol at the top of the agenda.</P>
    <P>Ireland might not be leading any soccer, economic or tourism leagues in Europe but it is certainly top of the league as far as alcohol consumption is concerned, a fact of which we should be ashamed not proud. This matter needs the most urgent and immediate attention of the Government. I concur with what Deputy McGahon stated earlier. While it is great to see the Government putting in place a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and making every effort to stem the tide in relation to smoking, the same efforts are not being made in terms of tackling the problems caused by alcohol.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the powerful, proactive advertising campaigns employed by <Col N="1199" /> tobacco companies. However, these pale into insignificance when compared to the effective advertising campaigns utilised by alcohol companies. Deputy Michael Moynihan referred to the difficulties in encouraging young people to stop smoking or in preventing them from taking up the habit. I agree with him that this will be an enormous task, however encouraging them to either reduce the level of alcohol they consume or to not drink at all will be an even greater task. I hope the Minister of State and her colleagues are giving serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legislation before us, I served for a short period on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, chaired by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, which was, at that stage, drawing up reports on tobacco. It has since issued a substantial report and it would be a major step forward if many of the recommendations contained therein could be implemented. The question of advertising tobacco products gave rise to many discussions among members of the committee and I believe the Government is moving very much in the right direction in respect of that matter. I hope the Bill will at least begin to stem the tide.</P>
    <P>I agree with the individual measures being proposed in the Bill. However, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Perry in respect of the practicalities surrounding the restrictions relating to the sale of tobacco products. While I welcome the fact that the controls are being tightened, there is a certain level beyond which we should not go. Our task should be to try to encourage people not to buy cigarettes. A person who wishes to purchase cigarettes will certainly do so, whether they get them from a shelf which can or cannot be seen. It has taken generations for this problem to reach its current stage and it will take at least one generation to solve it. The solution will only come about when people no longer wish to purchase cigarettes. I hope the regulations, particularly as they apply to smaller shopkeepers, will be put in place in such a way that they will be practical and workable. We do not want another Irish solution to an Irish problem where the law will say one thing while people will do something else in practice. I hope a balance can be achieved in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation as a practical step forward. In my opinion it will make a difference. I hope the ban on advertising will, in some way, dim the lights in so far as the attractiveness of smoking is concerned. I also hope that the much greater scourge on our society, alcohol, will be tackled in a much more strident, proactive fashion. That scourge is leaving a permanent scar on society. The image of the drunken stage Irishman and Irishwoman was all right for a laugh, but the laughter has ceased and alcohol consumption has become a serious problem which requires urgent attention.</P>

      <P>Tá lúcháir orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin mBille tábhachtach seo, a mbeidh tionchar aige ar shaol na tíre. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tionchar chun sochar aige ar shláinte na tíre. Tá a fhios againn go léir, agus tá sé ráite go minic anseo ó cuireadh an Bille os comhair an Tí, an dochar agus an díobháil a thig le tobac a dhéanamh do shláinte fhisiciúil na ndaoine agus do shláinte eacnamaíochta na ndaoine chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí mé i mo shuí ansin ag éisteacht leis na cainteoirí eile, smaoinigh mé gur chualamar nuair a bhíomar ag dul chun na scoile na blianta ó shin go bhfuil sé beagnach 500 bliain ó tugadh an tobac go hÉirinn don chéad uair. Duine a bhí ina chónaí i gCorcaigh a thug cuairt ar an domhan úr a thug anseo é. Cuirtear ina leith gurbh é Sir Walter Raleigh a thug an tobac go hÉirinn. Deirtear gur thug sé na prataí go hÉirinn chomh maith. Bainimid go léir tairbhe agus taitneamh agus sólás éigin as na prátaí ach ní féidir an rud céanna a rá faoin tobac.</P>
      <P>Tá sé de nós le fada agus tá sé faiseanta go breá, go speisialta ins na blianta a chuaigh thart, duine a fheiceáil agus toitín, nó píopa, nó totóg nó rud éigin eile aige. Is beag duine againn nár chaith toitín nó tobac am éigin. Nuair a bhíomar uilig inár bpáistí scoile ba mhór an rud dul amach agus toitíní a cheannach i ngan fhios agus iad a chaitheamh i ngan fhios. Sa pháirt den tír a dtagaimse as, bíonn faire againn nuair a fhaigheann duine bás. In áiteanna eile labhartar faoi teach tórraimh ach tugaimidne teach faire air. Bhíodh fonn orainn uilig a bheith ins an teach faire go maidin mar go mbíodh toitíní ar fáil, a oiread agus gur féidir a chaitheamh. Tá cuimhne agam uair amháin a bheith i mo shuí go maidin i dteach faire agus dul chun na scoile an lá arna mhárach agus a bheith íontach tinn ar fad. Shíl mo mháthair go raibh mé i mo shuí i rith na hoíche agus gurb shin an fáth go raibh mé tinn ach is é an fáth go raibh mé tinn ná go raibh an oiread sin toitíní caite agam. B'fhéidir gurb shin an rud ab fhearr a tharla ariamh, mar thig liom a rá nár chaith mé morán acu ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
      <P>Cuireann an tobac isteach ar shláinte na ndaoine. Tá figiúirí agus staitisticí tugtha ins an Teach le cupla lá ó cuireadh an Bille seo ós ár gcomhair. Is uafásach an rud é go bhfaigheann 7,000 bás ins an tír seo gach bliain le galair a fhaigheann siad ó chaitheamh tobac, idir galar chroí, plúchadh agus, níos measa ná sin, ailse. Deirtear go bhfaigheann 2,000 duine bás gach bliain de bharr ailse na scamhóige, ceann de na hailsí is deacra a láimhseáil agus a leigheas. Is mó duine óg atá i measc na ndaoine sin agus is beag teaghlach sa tír nach bhfuil duine éigin breoite, nó marbh, ann de bharr ailse nó galar éigin eile a tháinig ón tobac. Sin an fáth go chuirim fáilte mhór roimh an mBille seo. B'fhéidir nach dtéann sé fada go leor ach ar aon nós, céim ar aghaidh atá ann.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Nuair a bhím ag tiomáint ar fud na tíre idir seo agus Tír Chonaill, feicim na scoláire, cuid acu chomh hóg le 13 d'aois, amuigh ag am lóin agus toitíní á gcaitheamh acu. Deirim liom féin gur mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó céille ag na daoine óga sin, ag déanamh dochair dá sláinte agus ag cur airgid amú. Cén dóigh gur féidir linn dul i bhfeidhm ar na daoine óga agus cur in iúil dóibh go bhfuil siad ag déanamh dochair mór dóibh féin? Ní leor a rá leo go bhfaighidh siad ailse nó galar croí ó bheith ag caitheamh. Ní chuimhníonn daoine óga ar a leithéid. Caithfear teacht ar an fhadhb ar dhóigh éigin eile. B'fhéidir go gcaithfear é a dhéanamh tríd an scoil. Ní fiú an luach a chur suas mar fiú amháin nuair a chuirtear an luach suas faightear an t-airgead in áit éigin.</P>
    <P>Is droch rud é réaltóga scannáin agus daoine galánta a fheiceáil ins na hirisleabhair dathúla agus iad ag caitheamh, mar cothaíonn sé seo an íomhá gur rud breá é a bheith ag caitheamh toitíní. Caithfimid díriú isteach air sin agus cosc a chur le fógraíocht den chineál sin. Is céim ar aghaidh mhór é nach bhfuil fógraíocht tobac ar an teilifís, ar an raidió nó ar na meáin cumarsáide a thagann faoi bhráid an Stáit. Mar sin féin, tá an fhógraíocht le feiceáil in áiteanna eile. Tá an fhógraíocht seo ceangailte go mór le cúrsaí spóirt. Thagair an Teachta Bradford do na rásaí gluaisteán agus do na comhlachtaí móra ar nós Marlboro a thugann tacaíocht don spórt sin. Ceanglaíonn daoine óga an spórt agus an tobac le chéile agus an chéad rud eile, tá siad ag caitheamh. Caithfimid díriú isteach air sin chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cén focal Gaeilge atá ar &ldquo;passive smoking&rdquo;? B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé ag an Aire Stáit nuair a bheidh sí ag tabhairt freagra. Na blianta ó shin nuair a bhí gluaisteán agam don chéad uair, nior chuir sé isteach nó amach orm duine a bheith ag caitheamh in aice liom sa charr. Ach anois, cuireann sé isteach orm nuair a bhíonn duine istigh i mo charr ag caitheamh toitíní. Ní hamháin go mbíonn an boladh ins an charr ach bíonn sé ar mo chuid éadaí chomh maith. Tá sé de nós ag daoine nuair a théann siad chun deoch a ól i dteach tábhairne toitín a lasadh, agus bíonn gach duine eile, cé acu atá siad ag caitheamh nó nach bhfuil, ag sú isteach an ghail agus é ag déanamh dochair dóibh ins na blianta amach rompu. Luaigh an Teachta Ó Braonáin tábhairneoir a raibh aithne aige air, nár chaith toitín ariamh ach a chaith a shaol ag obair i dteach tábhairne agus a fuair bás le hailse scamhóige. Is léiriú é seo ar an dochar a thig le tobac a dhéanamh, fiú amháin do dhuine nach bhfuil ag caitheamh é féin.</P>
    <P>Tá costas eacnamaíochta leis an tobac chomh maith. Cosnaíonn 20 toitín thart ar £4. Cosnaíonn sé thart ar £30 sa tseachtain &ndash; £1,500 sa bhliain &ndash; ar dhuine ar bith atá ag caitheamh 20 toitín sa lá. Is mór an cháin í sin ar líon tí. Agus is minic a thagann na daoine a bhíonn ag caitheamh ón <Col N="1202" /> aicme is lú a bhfuil airgead acu agus is lú atá ábalta costas mar sin a chur orthu féin.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an tobac isteach ar shláinte na ndaoine agus ar eacnamaíocht na dteaghlaigh agus déanann sé dochar don timpeallacht chomh maith. Sin iad na fáthanna a chuirim fáilte roimh an mBille. B'fhéidir nach dtéann sé fada go leor. Ní shílim go raibh uchtach ag an Aire díriú isteach ar chaitheamh tobac in áiteanna poiblí cosúil le bialanna agus tithe tábhairne agus sin rud a chaithfear a dhéanamh. Dúirt an t-Aire go mbeidh sé ag cuartú rialacha a thabhairt isteach a bhaineann le tithe tábhairne ins an am atá amach romhainn. Is mór an trua nach bhfuil sé níos soiléire ins an mBille cad é atá sé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh. Tá an ceangal idir an deoch agus na toitíni. Téann an dá rud le chéile. Caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh chomh maith mar gheall ar fhógraíocht dí. Tá rialacha tugtha isteach maidir le fógraíocht tobac ach níor thugamar aghaidh ar chúrsaí i gceart go fóill.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille, chomh fada agus a théann sé. D'fhéadfadh sé dul níos faide. Tá tíortha eile ins an domhan a bhfuil rialacha i bhfad níos déine acu. Tá na comhlachtaí móra tobac ag imeacht ón domhain forbartha agus ag cur a gcuid táirgí go dtí an tríú domhan. Feicfimid toradh an tobac agus na galair a théann leis ins an tríú domhan ins na blianta amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Níl an fhadhb fuascailte againn féin go fóill. Má dhéanann an Bille seo aon rud chun aire níos fearr a thabhairt do shláinte na ndaoine is fiú tacaíocht a thabhairt dó.</P>

      <P>Nach breá an rud a bheith i mo shuí anseo ag éisteacht le daoine ag rá dea-rudaí faoi reachtaíocht atá ag dul tríd an dá Theach. Bhí sé soléir ón méid a bhí le rá ag an-chuid daoine ó gach phairtí, go bhfáiltíonn Baill an Tí roimh na tuairimí ginearálta sa reachtaíocht. Ina ainneoin sin beidh Baill ag moladh leasaithe nuair a pléitear an Bille ar Chéim an Choiste. Deir an t-Aire go bhfáilteoidh sé roimh na leasaithe sin agus go mbeidh sé ag éisteacht go géar agus go cruinn leo nuair a pléifear an Bille os comhair an choiste ag tús na bliana seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>Ba dheas freisin a bheith ag éisteacht leis an Teachta McGinley ag insint dúinn faoi Sir Walter Raleigh agus faoi na dea-rudaí agus na droch-rudaí a rinne sé, ní hamháin gur thug sé na prátaí dúinn ach an tobac chomh maith. Nach eisean a leag a bhrat faoi chosa na Banríona Éilíse? Caithfimid cuimhneamh go bhfuil cáil air de bharr rud eile a dhéanamh seachas a bheith dea-bhéasach do na mná. Is féidir smaoineamh air i slite difriúla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also struck me that I have not ever before heard in a debate so many people declare an interest in the topic being debated. I am not sure whether Members have to declare in their declarations of interest if they are or are not smokers <Col N="1203" /> but almost every speaker in this debate declared whether they were smokers, non-smokers or former smokers. Each of them also welcomed the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am vehemently opposed to smoking. I seem to spend my time trying to get my father, Senator Hanafin, not to smoke because of his heart condition. It got to the stage where, shortly after one of his heart surgeries, while he denied blankly to my face that he had been smoking, the pocket of his dressing gown went on fire from the cigarette inside it. That is just one example of the lengths to which smokers will go.</P>
    <P>The hugely detrimental effect it has on people's health was a recurring theme of the contributions. It is something of which everybody is conscious. The Government is anxious to implement its policy on smoking, contained in the report &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo;. It is one of a number of reports on smoking and health which have been published in recent years and some of its elements are incorporated in the Bill. The two reports of the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on health and smoking and the reports of the cardiovascular health strategy group are also reflected in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Like a number of speakers, my interest is in addiction among young people, particularly teenage girls. In my teaching days, I noticed it was a particular problem. I do not know whether it was for image or weight purposes or if the pressure on girls from advertising, not of cigarettes but of the type of image to which they aspired, caused them to smoke. Young people see themselves as invincible; they do not believe they will die or be ill as a result of smoking. They do not see it as something they should avoid.</P>
    <P>Recent advertising campaigns try to counter that image, particularly one I launched last year for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which focuses on young teenage girls and tries to indicate to them that smoking causes bad breath, bad smell and bad skin. I look forward to the strengthening of the ban on advertising and, particularly, the strong enforcement elements of the Bill. They convey a message to the public.</P>
    <P>Each speaker acknowledged that smoking is a public health issue. It is a public health issue when it causes 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland and when people suffer from a range of different illnesses and diseases. Smoking is dangerous and socially unacceptable. Each Deputy called for it to be made even less attractive for young people. They are also anxious that consumption is controlled and that we help smokers to stop smoking. Obviously, if we prevent young people from starting to smoke, the job will be easier down the road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> Many people have contributed to this Bill in various ways, through their reports and their work on the sub-committee and in the Department. We are faced with many challenges in improving the health status of our people. Smoking and the effects of smoking place an unacceptable burden on the health and wellbeing of the nation and we must take effective measures across a wide range of areas to remedy that. We have the facts about addiction and we must ensure that we prevent, control and help it. There are various methods of doing it and this legislation will give a strong basis to our efforts to achieve a tobacco free society.</P>
    <P>It will require a co-ordinated national effort. On Committee Stage, Members will give serious consideration to all elements of the Bill from the point of view of the consumer, the advertiser, the shopkeeper and the enforcement regulations. Only a national co-ordinated effort will work. Only then will we get the results we desire. Ta súil againn go mbeimid tar éis an suíomh agus an timpeallacht a athrú de bharr na smaointí atá á nochtú againn inniu i leith an tobac.</P>

    <P>Seo scoil den chéad scoth, le múinteoirí den chéad scoth, tuismitheoirí atá ag fulaingt agus daltaí atá ag freastal ar scoil atá i ndroch fhoirg<Col N="1205" /> neamh nach bhfuil oiriúnach a thuilleadh do chaighdeán oideachais atá na múinteoirí agus na tuismitheoirí ag iarraidh a sholáthar. Is cosúil ag an bpointe seo go bhfuil foirgneamh na scoile ag titim as a chéile toisc nach spéis leis an Aire nó an Roinn aon rud fiúntach a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Is deacair a thuiscint cén fáth nach bhfuil an tAire nó an Roinn sásta cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir leis an scoil seo a ath-chóiriú, scoil nua a thógaint nó na maisiúcháin is práinní a dhéanamh le gur féidir leanúint le scolaíocht shláintiúil feasta i Scoil Mológa.</P>
    <P>This school was built in the 1930s as a girls' school and it later became a Gaelscoil for boys and girls. This year the school had to turn away 62 pupils, which is an indicator of its popularity and how it is regarded by parents in the area and from far outside the immediate locality.</P>
    <P>The school is in the INTO list of worst schools yet it has excellent teachers and parents who are endeavouring to provide their children with the best education. Five classes share one toilet with four toilet bowls. The school has no hall, library, computer room or art room. The remedial teacher and special needs teacher share a desk divided by a partition in one of the school corridors. If the children want to do PE, they can only do so by hiring an adjoining hall of another school at 9 a.m. They have no storage space for their sports gear so they carry it back and forth each time they need to use it. There have been three separate reports by the Department. One recommended renovation of the school, the second recommended reconstruction and a third report recommended that a new school should be built. There has been no communication from the Department for 18 months.</P>
    <P>The school and the parents have been patient but they need a commitment that they will see positive action on the facilities that are being provided. I accept that there has been a major commitment to school building programmes but this is no good to the teachers, pupils and the parents of Scoil Mológa. They have not seen any of the benefits of this programme and many children will go through their entire primary school years in an appalling building. Teachers who have worked there for years are fed up with the conditions and yet they continue to deliver top class education to their pupils because of their personal commitment.</P>
    <P>They have waited almost two years for a reply from the Department. They do not know whether they are considered to be in line for renovations, reconstruction or an entire new building. I am asking that Scoil Mológa be given a commitment that work will commence in 2002.</P>

    <P>The accommodation for the school consists of six permanent classrooms, two prefabs, staff room, principal's office, secretary's office and toilets. The school authorities initially applied to the Department of Education and Science for grant aid towards the cost of providing additional toilet facilities at the school. The Department's building unit advised the board of management to appoint a consultant architect to report on the long-term accommodation needs of the school. This report has been received and is currently being examined by the Department's building unit.</P>

A decision on the appointment of design teams in respect of individual projects, including Scoil Mológa, will be taken in the light of recent allocation for primary school buildings in last week's budget.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an cheist seo a ardú annso anocht. Last August, the announcement of the closure of GSI in Macroom came as a bombshell to the people of the area. Not alone did this closure have a devastating effect on the town, but on the whole locality. The employees in this factory came from the surrounding area, within a radius of about 20 miles. People travelled there from Dunmanway, Millstreet, Ballincollig and Killarney. It has affected the economy of the town of Macroom. It has also had a devastating effect on the rural community, as many small farming holdings were dependent on the second income generated by GSI. Many people who worked there have been in the factory since it opened, and in some instances both husband and wife were employed there. This will be a major factor in the repayment of house mortgages. Its closure has a knock-on effect on many local businesses, which depended on GSI, and the various suppliers to this enterprise. Thereby, the 700 redundancies could possibly be doubled when those other jobs are taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the closure of GSI, a task force was set up. The search for an alternative industry to locate in the GSI facility has been the main target <Col N="1207" /> of this task force. The task force has now been in operation for more than four months. Numerous companies have been contacted and a brochure has been produced to market the facility, but it would appear that concrete results have not been achieved, and the plant is still empty. The success of this task force can only be measured in terms of achieving its goal, which is to find a replacement industry or industries. Reports are made available, but will this task force be wound down like the one set up at the Monyleke factory in Dunmanway and wound down recently without any replacement industry found? I understand this premises is now used as a warehouse. This would not be a satisfactory outcome for the GSI plant.</P>
    <P>Is the IDA pursuing any definite line of action? Is there any conclusive evidence that the task force has produced results. I know a small number of people have been re-employed, mainly in Cork city, and others have gone on courses with FÁS and to further education. However, this is not the answer to the problem that exists following this closure, and will not be a solution in the long-term. The creation of jobs is what is needed in Macroom, either through a new company or a number of smaller industries.</P>

      <P>Following the announcement of the closure of General Semiconductor on 17 August, 2001, the Tánaiste immediately agreed to the establishment of a task force for the area. At the same time, she asked IDA Ireland and FÁS &ndash; the National Training Authority &ndash; to mobilise their resources to ensure that no time was lost in responding to the closure. The Macroom task force was subsequently established on 20 August, 2001. The terms of reference were as follows: to make proposals and to advise the Tánaiste in response to the situation in Macroom, arising from the closure of General Semiconductor; to secure alternative job creating enterprise both from overseas and indigenous investors for Macroom; to provide an immediate skills assessment and suitable training opportunities for the workers affected by the closure of General Semiconductor; to provide the necessary information and assistance to any employees who may wish to establish their own enterprises; and to assess the infrastructure needs of the Macroom area, having regard to the significant work already undertaken in the context of preparations for a new Cork area development plan. The task force report is on the point of completion and the Tánaiste looks forward to examining it in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the closure announcement, the search for a new project to locate in the facility in Macroom has been a key priority task for IDA Ireland. It is encouraging that six companies have now vis<Col N="1208" /> ited the facility. IDA Ireland is targeting the following options to seek a new project: a new Greenfield project from overseas; an expansion-led project from the existing base of overseas companies in Ireland that may require a new building-location; a detailed re-targeting of companies that visited Cork recently &ndash;  details of the facility will be sent to these companies to encourage them to include the GSI building in their location analyses; and an urgent follow-up on any location queries generated by the publicity surrounding the closure announcement.</P>
    <P>The key target sectors are as follows: pharmaceuticals and medical devices; international services; and information and communications technologies. A promotional brochure produced by the task force and funded by General Semiconductor has been distributed to IDA Ireland offices, IDA project divisions and to target companies world-wide. The task force chairman has met the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland and received an assurance that the search for a new project in Macroom will continue to be a priority task for the IDA.</P>
    <P>In addition, the vice president of General Semiconductor Ireland, Macroom &ndash; also a member of the task force &ndash; recently met the IDA world-wide marketing director in New York and the director of IDA, Asia-Pacific in Taiwan. Progress in the search for a new project will be reviewed and monitored regularly by the IDA regional office in Cork. In reaction to the closure announcement, FÁS conducted on-site registration interviews and 506 employees from a total available work force of 629 registered with FÁS. FÁS has put in place a structured skills programme which commenced in October, 2001, while other training and education supports have also been available to the employees.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of the staff have already obtained alternative employment. Macroom, being midway between Cork and Killarney, is well positioned to facilitate future industrial development. Two planned major road schemes, the Ballincollig bypass and Macroom bypass, will further enhance access. I assure Deputy Donal Moynihan, on behalf of the Tánaiste, that every possible effort is being made to secure a replacement industry, and by FÁS to secure alternative employment for the work force affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas Cheann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Penrose and me to raise this important issue. The closure of the peat generating power stations has resulted in the loss of 214 jobs in the ESB since 1986. Rhode power station will close in the next four years with the loss of a further 101 jobs. Bord na Móna has lost more than 1,000 jobs since 1986 giving total job <Col N="1209" /> losses of 1,326 in that period. Most of these job losses have been in the midlands, in towns such as Rochfordbridge, Milltownpass, Tyrellspass, Kilbeggan, Tullamore and Edenderry, which have all suffered badly, both economically and socially, due to the losses. This loss of work opportunities in areas so dependent on Bord na Móna and the ESB has contributed to a reducing population, migration of young workers and a lower average income base, as defined by the CSO statistics.</P>
      <P>The Rhode power station, with its 101 jobs, could have an extension of its generating life. When we consider the cost of paying wages and partially refurbishing the plant, and contrast this with the cost of redundancy payments, public service obligation payments, plant wind-down costs and rehabilitation costs, as well as possible unemployment costs, it may well be economically viable to keep the plant generating into the electricity grid for a further three or four years. If we consider the social obligations of those two large semi-State companies, then the project is certainly viable for a further short number of years.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State to intercede with her senior colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, to ask the boards of ESB and Bord na Móna to urgently consider proposals put forward from the Rhode action group and to give these proposals special consideration. Indeed, the midlands area has taken a substantial hit from job losses in these two State companies and it is incumbent on this Government and Minister to endeavour to find new jobs. Here is an opportunity to postpone the possible loss of 101 permanent jobs and stop the haemorrhage of job losses in the midlands area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing his time. The existing ESB station at Rhode, which employs 101 people currently, is designated to close in the next four years. This, in itself, will be a big blow to the economy of the midlands as many of the workers involved are drawn from the north Offaly and mid and south Westmeath areas. Indeed, when this station closes eventually, it will represent a loss of income of about £3.5 million for the towns and villages where these workers live and spend their income. It will represent a significant blow to the areas involved. The State will also lose significant payments in terms of PAYE, PRSI and payments of the statutory redundancy associated with such closure. Furthermore, there will be the additional costs associated with the payment of unemployment benefit, as Deputy McGrath said, so the immediate closure of the station will have significant cost implications for the Exchequer. Those costs must also be considered in the overall calculation as to why it makes good, sound, prudent and, indeed, economic sense for ESB to give a commitment that it will reopen the station as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> Under the tripartite agreement between the Government, management and unions, it was agreed that the public service obligation would be paid for a period of five years from February 2000 and, therefore, this makes it possible for the station to run until 2005. The agreement also facilitates a situation whereby the closure of the Rhode station would dovetail with the opening of the two new stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge. Indeed, the question arises as to whether these two stations will be completed within a particular time period.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the need for the emergency generation of electricity which has been the subject of much discussion in the past few years and which this year is costing £26 million in order to generate 160 megawatts of electricity. I understand Rhode power station could be repaired at a cost of about £3 million and this would generate about 40 megawatts of electricity for the national grid. The estimated cost of repairing unit three at Rhode includes a yearly maintenance cost of £400,000. The repair of the fans would cost £0.5 million which would have to be spent anyway. There is also the cost of removal of asbestos from the boiler. When added together, the total cost of repair following the accident is probably less than half the proposed figure. These costs in comparison with the cost of mobile generators to replace 40 megawatts are up to £4 million cheaper. What must also be included in a cost calculation is the necessity of having to import alternative sources of energy which will occur if we write a generating station such as Rhode out of the national network.</P>
    <P>The premature closure of Rhode power station would also have serious consequences for Bord na Móna and the staff of Derrygreenagh works, as Deputy McGrath said. It will also have significant impacts on communities and business at Rochfordbridge, Tyrrellspass, Kinnegad, Kilbeggan, Milltownpass, etc. In relation to Derrygreenagh, a significant number of seasonal workers have already been laid off a lot earlier than usual &ndash; up to 100 have gone. When Rhode closes down, there will be a further loss of 30 permanent employees and 50 to 60 seasonal employees. Bord na Móna has invested heavily in bog development, infrastructure and plant and machinery to ensure peat is supplied to the Edenderry station concurrent with supplying a significant amount to Rhode power station. It will incur significant losses.</P>
    <P>There has been enough prevarication and side-stepping. The board of the ESB has had the external energy report, which was furnished to the Health and Safety Authority in November, and which should now be back with the ESB. The ESB must make a positive decision to reopen this unit three station at Rhode at its January 2002 board meeting. A failure to do so will spell a <Col N="1211" /> gloomy economic message for this part of the midlands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter. They will be aware that the operation of ESB power generating stations, including Rhode, is a day to day operational matter for the board and management of the ESB. It is expected that the board will be in a position to take a decision regarding Rhode early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the power station is that a tube failure occurred in the boiler on 12 May 2001 while returning to service from a seven week outage. There was significant consequential damage, including the rupturing of a number of additional tubes and a breach of the brickwork on the furnace wall.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the incident, the ESB set up its own internal investigation team and notified the Health and Safety Authority. Given the seriousness of the incident, three sets of investigations were put in place. External experts have carried out a review of the plant and reported their findings. The ESB has made this report available to the Health and Safety Authority as that authority is currently carrying out its own review. The authority report is expected later this month. In addition, ESB engineers and local station staff are examining all options to facilitate a safe return to service. As I am sure the Deputies will appreciate, it is crucial for the board of the ESB to fully investigate the causes of this incident and to give full consideration to all the options regarding the future operation of the station.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that ESB board decision will take full account of all the particular aspects of this case, including the provision of electricity generating capacity and employment consequences in the midlands region.</P>
      <P>On a wider level, the job losses from Bord na Móna and ESB have been addressed by a number of local bodies coming together with representatives of Offaly County Council, Offaly County Enterprise Board, Bord na Móna, ESB, North Offaly-Oak Partnership Task Force and West Offaly Partnership-Task Force. A county enterprise board fund is being established to address the issue of attracting investment and employment opportunities into the areas affected. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a special allocation of £100,000 to the Offaly County Enterprise Board towards the setting up of this fund which will be augmented by contributions from the other parties mentioned above. This initiative is at an early stage and confirmation-negotiations on funding from other bodies is currently taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring <Col N="1212" /> the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. A key factor in the achievement of this objective, and a primary objective of this Government, is the creation of a business environment in which job opportunities continue to flourish and, equally, in which job applicants have the requisite skills requirements. In line with commitments contained in the national development plan, the enterprise development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The 12.5% corporation tax rate and initiatives on matters such as education, physical infrastructure and technology under the national development plan, allow Ireland to remain competitive both in developing indigenous industry and securing inward investment projects.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the objective of balanced regional development will be achieved, IDA Ireland has, over the past two years, radically changed its policy with a commitment to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions, of which Offaly is a part, in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The results for the year 2000 showed that there were 589 new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in the midlands region, resulting in a net gain of 105 jobs, which reflects how the agency's strategy is beginning to show results. In the past 18 months, the agency has succeeded in attracting a number of companies to the county, including Sanirish, Continental AG, Flextronics and Grafica Zannini, which between them employed over 330 people at the end of November 2001. Grafica Zannini has completed the construction of its building and recruitment has now started.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced in May 2001 that GeneMedix would establish its European manufacturing centre, incorporating development and technical support capability, in the 21,313 square foot advance facility on IDA Ireland's Srah Business Park in Tullamore. The project will involve investment of 7.2 million and is expected to create up to 55 jobs during the initial start up phase. IDA Ireland continues to market Tullamore, Birr and Edenderry in County Offaly for suitable inward investment projects. In the past year, there have been 21 site visits by IDA Ireland clients to Tullamore and ten site visits to Birr. IDA Ireland is represented on the Tullamore inter-agency task force which was set up and it is also a member of the Offaly County Development Board. IDA Ireland transferred additional posts to the regions and the staff complement in Athlone has gone up.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and the Offaly County Enterprise Board are also actively promoting the development of indigenous enterprises. <Col N="1213" /> Enterprise Ireland supports 28 client companies in the east Offaly area alone, excluding Tullamore, employing almost 650 people at the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>It also recognises that some communities require specific assistance to develop and fulfil their potential. The agency highlights the strengths of the midlands region. The area has the benefit of the Athlone Institute of Technology and of improved access to attract new overseas investment into the area. It has the benefit of being recognised in the NDP with its roads, railway and air services, etc. The IDA will keep in close contact with the relevant infrastructure providers to ensure the midlands area continues to be developed.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is confident that the ongoing co-ordinated job creation efforts by the industrial development agencies in County Offaly will bring positive results to the area and help to offset any effects on the region due to the current difficulties being experienced by the Rhode power station.</P>

        <b>: </b>I dtosach ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as ucht na deise a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar seo. Tá brón orm nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais i láthair cé go bhfuil Aire Stáit cairdiúil anseo chun freagra a thabhairt dom. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle used the phrase &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; with regard to the answers I received. I used the term &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;. The answers are consistent, but the information is misleading. I will explain the background.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago, the priest in Askea parish church started by preaching not from the Gospel, but about the frustration being experienced over a school that has leaking roofs, very bad windows, etc. He said that the roofs could not be repaired because permission to go ahead with the renovations had been deferred. He appealed to politicians in the church to do something about it. There must have been some present because there is no point preaching to absent friends. The following Tuesday, word came back through the local politician, who is a member of the Minister's party, that he had spoken to the Minister, who had rectified the problem, and all was well again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the priest do this, apart from frustration? He did it because, a few days previously, bad news had been received by the school from the Department that the work could not go ahead, but that there was some light at the end of the tunnel because they might get approval by the new year. I had already dealt with a school where this had happened and I was told that no decisions could be made until the budget. Everything was held off. I put down a question to the Minister, asking how many schools were in this <Col N="1214" /> situation, and I got a two line answer telling me that there was no school involved.</P>
    <P>I then put down a question about Askea school, specifically asking when it was given permission to go ahead with the restoration work, when it was withdrawn, when it was approved again and why. I got an answer furnishing me with three facts: one, that they started looking for help in January 2001; two, that they were told to go to tender in October 2001; and three, &ldquo;Following receipt of the tender report from the school's consultant architect, my Department issued a letter to the school authorities in November 2001 authorising them to accept the lowest tender for these works.&rdquo; About two weeks later, when the architect was happy, they got word to stop.</P>
    <P>I used the word &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; in that question and I decided somebody might have been playing with words so I asked the same question again, this time saying that approval was deferred or postponed. I got an answer stating exactly the same three facts as in the previous answer, but there was not a word about when approval was deferred or postponed and when it was restored. When we put down parliamentary questions, we expect answers. The priest did not go mad, have nightmares and get up on the altar to talk about this deferral, nor did the principal think he heard the 'phone ringing in his office when a Department official told him the work could not go ahead.</P>
    <P>I am telling the Minister of State in advance, in case she has the same gobbledegook in her answer, that she need not bother reading it to me because I intend pursuing the matter further. The Minister should be here. I told him today I was raising this issue and I regret that he is not here. If the Minister of State has an answer bordering on what I have in front of me, it will be a total waste of time. There was something rotten in the state of Denmark years ago. There is something rotten in the state of the Department now. We are not getting the answers we require. There is a totally different scene in Carlow. I do not accept the answers I receive. Christmas may interrupt my plans, but I assure the House that, after January, because I do not have the right of reply tonight, I will raise the issue again. If the answer of the Minister of State is the same as the one I have in front of me, I will save her breath by leaving the House.</P>

However, I will answer on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science and I am sure the Deputy will not leave the House, irrespective of what answer I give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science does not accept that misleading information was provided to the Deputy in his replies to his recent <Col N="1215" /> parliamentary questions. While the consultant architect for the schools was advised to proceed and prepare a tender report, it was clear from the report that the work could not be completed this year. Accordingly, approval to accept the tender was not given by the building unit at that time. Architectural planning for refurbishment works, including roof replacement, at Askea boys' and girls' national schools was initiated in January 2001. In October 2001 the Department authorised the school authorities to proceed to invite tenders for the roof replacement element of these works on the understanding from the consultant architect that the works would be completed within eight to ten weeks from commencement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Department's primary building unit is currently processing a large number of projects. The rate of progress to construction of these projects depends on a number of factors, including the funding available to meet commitments and new projects in any financial year. Officials in the Department informed the school authorities that, since the work could not be completed within the current financial year, as had been specified, the project could not commence until the new financial year, which commences in January. When <Col N="1216" /> this issue was brought to the Minister's attention he immediately gave instructions that the project was to proceed because of the urgent nature of the roof replacement.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that detailed security and logistical plans for safeguarding the issue of euro currency and the return of Irish currency have been agreed by all key stakeholders. The Garda Síochána, through its community relations department, has been in direct contact with representative groups concerning the crime prevention aspects of this matter. Furthermore, all gardaí have been advised to interact locally with persons affected by the changeover to ensure that they are provided with maximum protection during the changeover period.</P>

      <P>On 10 December 2001, there were 3,080 prisoners in custody, of whom 2,577 were sentenced prisoners. While the exact figures requested by the Deputy are not readily available, it is the case that all sentenced prisoners are required to participate in work or work training or to attend education classes. A prisoner may be excused only on medical grounds.</P>
      <P>Work available for prisoners includes baking, carpentry, crafts, upholstery, cleaning, woodwork, stores, special work parties and working with trades staff on maintenance. The guiding principles which underpin the work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody. Its aims are to counteract idleness, give useful skills and serve the purpose of promoting rehabilitation. Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Prison education has grown greatly in recent decades, achieving a substantial presence in all prisons and engaging more than half of all prisoners voluntarily in classes. In most prisons throughout the country it is the main activity of prisoners. This is an exceptionally high level of participation by international standards. A broad programme of education is offered consisting of the main school subjects, adult basic education, creative activities, social education and physical education. The aims are to help inmates cope with their sentences and prepare for release and, particularly, to offer the opportunity to discover and develop new potential within themselves.</P>
    <P>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour &ndash; much of this work done in close liaison with other disciplines. Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in May 1999 the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, was established under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Anthony J. Hederman. It was requested to examine all aspects of the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, taking into account the view of the participants to the multi-party negotiations that the development of a peaceful environment on the basis of the agreement reached on 10 April 1998 can and should mean a normalisation of security arrangements and practices; the threat posed by international terrorism and organised crime; and Ireland's obligations under international law.

    <P>There has been one escape from within a closed prison institution during this period. The woman in question was subsequently recaptured by the gardaí and returned to Mountjoy Prison. In all of the other cases, prisoners escaped from the custody of prison officers while outside the confines of a closed institution, for example during the course of an escort to court or hospital. The above figures do not include escapes of prisoners from Garda custody, abscondings from open centres or persons failing to return from temporary release.</P>
    <P>Prisoners have succeeded in escaping by using a variety of means including, producing syringes in the course of an escort and demanding that their handcuffs be removed, breaking through windows in the holding cells of courthouses, climbing out of hospital windows, and in one recent incident, armed intervention by associates. It should be noted that the vast majority of these escapees have since been recaptured and returned to prison to complete their sentences. A few have returned voluntarily.</P>
    <P>There will always be an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison, given that the dignity of the prisoner is to be respected. It is, however, estimated that less than one in every thousand escorts result in incidents which lead to an escape bid by a prisoner. The vast majority of escorts effected by prison officers are completed without incident. There have, of course, been many occasions, usually unreported, where prison staff, by their vigilance and professionalism have succeeded in preventing the escape of prisoners, often when faced with considerable threat to their own safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 29 and 232 together.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to citizenship by birth has long been a feature of Irish legislation. Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, provides that every person born in the island of Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen. This applies irrespective of the immigration status of either of the parents. This feature of Irish citizenship law is unique in the European Union, and unusual worldwide. In other EU member states the citizenship of a child born in that state is generally dependent on the citizenship of the parents and/or the status and duration of residence of the parents in the state concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entitlement to citizenship by birth is now also a constitutional right arising from Article 2 of the Constitution, as amended following the Good Friday Agreement. Accordingly, a constitutional amendment would be required before any alteration of the existing statutory position would be possible. In line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case [1990] 2 I.R. 151, subject to the common good, a non-Irish national who becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State with that citizen. There has been a significant increase in the number of applications from non-nationals to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child in the last year. In the year to end November, my Department received 5,247 applications for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen from current or former asylum applicants. The number of such persons granted leave to remain in the State on this basis in the period was <Col N="1221" /> 2,398. This compares with 909 in the year 2000 and 1,227 in 1999.</P>
    <P>Evidence suggests that a significant proportion of adult female asylum applicants are pregnant upon arrival in the State and that their decision to seek asylum in Ireland is, at least in part, motivated by the anticipation of the benefits which might accrue for themselves, their partner and their child as a result of that child being born in Ireland. While it is of course the case that some such persons could also have a well-founded basis for seeking asylum, a large proportion of such applicants either withdraw their asylum claims, when seeking permission to remain on the basis of parentage, or are refused status under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. There have also been instances of attempted abuse by the submission of false claims of parentage.</P>
    <P>Under our present constitutional and legislative position it is possible for a person to arrive in the State in an advanced stage of pregnancy to arrange for their child to be born in the State, the child thereby becoming an Irish citizen and an EU citizen. The child has an entitlement to benefit from EU treaty and EU legislative entitlements to free movement and residence. On foot of the Fajujonu judgment the parents have a strong claim to be allowed to remain in Ireland and, after a period of legal residence, to obtain citizenship themselves. Such a system is of course potentially open to abuse by persons wishing to establish an entitlement to remain in Ireland or eventually to enter other EU member states. There are no proposals before Government at present to change the constitution in this regard. However, in light of the circumstances which have evolved in relation to this situation, my Department is keeping this issue under very careful and ongoing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my written replies to the same question on 3 October 2001, tabled in the name of Deputy William Penrose, and on 13 November 2001, tabled in the name of Deputy Róisín Shortall, the total figure for overtime expenditure in 2000 was 49,118,518, £38,683,977. The largest overtime payment to any one individual was 56,484, £44,485, which was paid to a Prison Officer in mountjoy prison. The average overtime per officer during 2000 was 15,663, £12,336.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capacity to earn high sums in overtime arises from the preference of local prisons man<Col N="1222" /> agement and staff to meet overtime staffing requirements on a voluntary basis. Certain staff make themselves available for unpopular and unsocial shifts more frequently than others and this is accepted as it reduces the need to compel other officers to work overtime. The Irish Prison Service is continuing to monitor levels of overtime and to take corrective action where possible. The underlying problems associated with the level of additional attendance involved in the operation of the prisons do not lend themselves to short-term solutions. Staffing levels and arrangements are the product of operational circumstances which have been in place for many decades against a background, at times, of considerable tensions and difficulty.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that the only way of addressing the problem is to follow a long-term strategy which addresses the methods of deployment and conditions of service which give rise to the present high levels of overtime. This is the approach which is now being taken. Arising from the report of the Prison Service Cost Review Group, a staffing and operations review, SORT, comprising senior personnel from my Department and local prisons management, was established with the following terms of reference: (a) to provide a credible record of what is actually happening in each prison having regard to the role and function of the prison regime and the constraints which exist; (b) to establish the cost in man hours of running the prison with present rosters and work-posts, while providing for non-effective time, e.g. sick leave and training and (c) to make recommendations about how arrangements can be improved and-or work reorganised to deliver an effective service.</P>
    <P>Detailed reports have been prepared in accordance with these terms of reference on all institutions within the prison system. In addition a global report, containing recommendations applicable service wide, was published earlier this year. These reports now provide the basis for the next stage of the strategy which is the strategic effectiveness programme, STEP, which has been under way since March last. The STEP process has involved the engagement of staff interests through a change implementation team in which both management and the Prison Officers' Association are represented. The team is examining how the revised tasks identified in the SORT reports might be undertaken without the need for overtime. It is also examining the changes which would need to be made to the management and organisational structure in the prisons and conditions of service. It is intended that the STEP process will lead as soon as possible, not only to more effective agreed work practices within the prison system, based on SORT recommendations, but also to a deeper emphasis on care and rehabilitation of prisoners. An enhanced training and development regime for prison staff will also be a core element in this new dispensation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I announced a review some time ago of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, which prohibits both actions intended to stir up hatred and actions likely to stir up hatred. This review is being carried out in co-operation with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. Submissions to the Department concerning the current operation of the Act and proposals for amendment of the legislation are being considered as part of the review. While progress has been made on the review, two recent developments will have to be taken into account before the review is concluded. On 28 November 2001, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. It is intended that the framework decision will replace an existing Joint Action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. Negotiations on the Framework Decision will commence in the new year. Also, the Council of Europe is establishing a new committee on criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks. Ireland will participate in this committee, which will draw up a draft Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime on this issue. I consider it appropriate to await the outcome of these negotiations before finalising the review of our existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to racist websites, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the computer crime unit of An Garda Síochána has, after investigation, made contact with a number of Internet service providers resulting in the removal of three <Col N="1224" /> illicit websites &ndash; Irish People's Party, Irish Fascist League, Irish Fascist Party.</P>

      <P>The Government recently approved proposals to increase the maximum number of members of the Garda Síochána who can, at any given time, be deployed on international police peace-keeping missions from 60 to 80 in the context of the EU's development of a crisis management capability. Ireland has a long established reputation in the area of international police peacekeeping missions and has much to contribute to EU developments in this area. The Garda Síochána has been involved in international peacekeeping missions since 1989. These have involved UN missions for the most part but gardaí have also participated in missions organised by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; OSCE and in monitoring missions organised by the EU. The practice since 1994 has been that not more than 60 members have been released for such duties at any one time.</P>
      <P>EU member states have committed themselves at successive European Council meetings to building a European security and defence policy capable of reinforcing the Union's external action through the development of a conflict prevention and crisis management capability, including civilian aspects. In this regard, they have agreed that member states should, by 2003, be able to provide up to 5,000 police officers for international missions across the range of conflict prevention and crisis management operations. In the above context, on 19/20 November 2001, a police commitment conference took place in Brussels, at which member states announced that the 5,000 target had been reached.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas that a total of 497 vehicles are allocated to stations within the Dublin metropolitan area. I am also informed that, in addition, support is provided by <Col N="1225" /> national units such as the national surveillance unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, the special detective unit and other similar units which have approximately another 350 vehicles available. A total of 35 vehicles are currently retained as spares at Garda headquarters. The Deputy may also wish to note that provision is made in the Garda Vote each year for the purchase and delivery of vehicles for the Garda fleet and the maintenance of existing vehicles. This year alone, over IR£6 million, 7.6 million will be spent on the purchase of new vehicles. The Garda fleet is also being constantly upgraded in order to ensure that the most modern facilities are available to members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a working group under the chairmanship of an assistant commissioner has examined and tested various types of less than lethal weapons which included live test firing of various projectiles. I am also advised that the group's findings have been approved by the Garda Commissioner and questions relating to implementation are now being looked at including procedures and assessing training needs for the use of less than lethal weapons.  I will consider the matter fully when these practical issues have been addressed.</P>

      <P>The family referred to arrived in the State on 10 November 1998 and sought asylum. Following an interview, it was concluded that their application was not such as to entitle them to a declaration as refugees. They were informed of this decision on 31 August 1999. Their subsequent appeal was refused by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 11 July 2000. In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the family in question was informed on 20 October 2000 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders. A further letter issued to them on 12 November 2001 which reiterated the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consent to the making of deportation orders. Representations were received in the last week from their legal representatives. These are now being considered in the context of Section 3 of the Immigration Act which includes the consideration of a person's employment history and prospects and I expect the file to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

The many international links fostered by the Garda Síochána enables this analysis to be conducted with the best available intelligence and also facilitates the Garda authorities in preparing and continually updating threat assessments.</P>

Most recently, the Taoiseach raised the matter with the British Prime Minister in the course of a bi-lateral meeting at the British-Irish Council meeting of 30 November 2001. The British Government is, therefore, very well aware of our interest in this matter. At Mr. Justice Barron's request, the Taoiseach wrote to Dr. Reid supporting the judge's request for a meeting with him, and Dr. Reid has confirmed that he will meet Mr. Justice Barron. This meeting will take place on 17 January 2002.</P>

      <P>Current statistics clearly indicate that significant progress has been made in relation to the processing of asylum applications and that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands and will help to progressively reduce processing times on an incremental basis. This is evidenced by the fact that the number of backlog cases &ndash; that is, cases which are over six months old &ndash; on hands in Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as at 30 November 2001 is now down to approximately 4,900, the vast majority of which are in the final stages of processing.</P>

From the information available to me, I am satisfied that there were genuine compassionate reasons in each of the cases referred to and also that the applications were made on bona fide grounds.</P>

      <P>The Government approved the purchase of a second Garda helicopter in November 1998. A tender competition was held and an EC 135 was ordered. That helicopter has now been constructed and fitted out with special police equipment. It is at present completing its acceptance tests and will be available shortly. This will greatly expand the area of operations of the air support unit and allow for greater availability of air support in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>The Government recently approved my proposal to contract out the piloting and maintenance of the second helicopter for a trial period. The Air Corps indicated that they would have to contract out the maintenance of this aircraft and I am availing of the opportunity to explore other piloting and maintenance arrangements with a view to assessing alternatives in terms of such factors as efficiency and cost-effectiveness. An interdepartmental committee to facilitate, oversee and assess the trial is in the process of being established. The arrangements for this new approach will be put in place over the next few months. When sufficient experience of the revised operating arrangements has been gained  &ndash; over a period of 12 to 24 months &ndash; the results of the trial will be submitted to Government.</P>

It is my intention to ensure that this situation will continue and that no prosecutions will be dropped or cases collapse due to delays in the processing of evidence by the laboratory.</P>

      <P>The investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron is continuing. A considerable number of allegations have been made in this matter and all of the allegations have been the subject of extensive investigation by the Garda authorities. As the Deputy will be aware, Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation has been completed and a file forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The results of two other investigations &ndash; apart from inquiries commenced under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989 &ndash; are awaited.</P>
      <P>Last year, I was approached by the two Opposition spokesmen on justice who gave me certain information which I conveyed to the Commissioner. As a result, Assistant Commissioner Murphy was instructed to carry out an investigation, which is proceeding. I am informed by the Garda authorities that extensive inquiries have been conducted which have failed to establish evidence to support the allegations. The investigation is currently awaiting legal advice from the DPP on one avenue of inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has also appointed a chief superintendent to investigate a matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation into the death of Mr. Barron. The member has since initiated legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Investigations have also been initiated under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989. On 9 June 2000 a superintendent was appointed to investigate the alleged neglect of duty and improper practices which arose during the investigation into the death of Richard Barron. The two members under investigation are on long-term sick leave and have, on legal advice, declined to co-operate with the investigating officer.</P>
      <P>On 29 June 2001 a chief superintendent was appointed to investigate alleged breaches of discipline against four members. While the investigation is at an advanced stage, certain difficulties have arisen concerning the release of exhibits which are required in relation to criminal prosecutions. In addition, one witness is unavailable due to medical reasons. Notwithstanding this, the investigating officer hopes to be in a position to report on the allegations against two of the members in the near future. The report on the other two members may be delayed depending on the progress of certain criminal matters and the release of necessary evidence.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers have assessed the implications to that organisation of the Garda youth policy advisory group report and have now prioritised the implementation of its recommendations for inclusion in the Garda policing plans for the year 2002 and beyond. The report contains two recommendations relating specifically to matters within my functional remit, namely, the proof of age scheme and the use of mobile CCTV units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the former case, the high level interdepartmental working group established to agree a co-<Col N="1236" /> ordinated response to recommendations contained in the interim report on off-licensing concluded that the age card scheme was seen as operating successfully but that efforts to promote awareness and usage of age cards should be intensified. In that context, I have established a review group within my Department to examine, in consultation with the Garda authorities, the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect that this group will report to me by the end of the year. With regard to the latter recommendation, I am pleased to report that my Department has approved a request received from the Garda authorities for the purchase of a mobile CCTV unit.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the establishment of a regulatory system for fast food outlets, mainly in relation to opening hours and security standards. This matter is framed in the context of legislation to enable the making of local by-laws and, as such, comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. However, I am very concerned with the problem of public order and drink-related street violence late at night, and I am, at present, urgently considering new legislative measures in that area which I will bring before Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <QRef>[32078/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stated aim of the report was to compare the experiences of children in direct provision with asylum seeker households living in the private rented sector and in receipt of the full rate of supplementary welfare allowance, SWA. I consider this report to be seriously deficient in a number of key respects and I will let the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the basis on which the report was compiled is open to serious questions in terms of the small size of the sample. Its findings were based on research comprising interviews, questionnaires and workshops with 43 households. Thirty per cent of these households or 13 families, with a total of 23 children, were in direct provision. The authors of the report acknowledge that the study used a small sample and that &ldquo;respondents were to a considerable extent, self-selecting&rdquo;. Neither the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, nor any other area of my Department was consulted about any aspect of this report. Moreover, there <Col N="1237" /> was no consultation with accommodation providers, centre management or staff.</P>
    <P>The report's key findings about extreme deprivation and extreme poverty are based primarily on assertions by the respondents that they use their inadequate resources to either provide their own food &ndash; because of the alleged inadequacy of the food provided &ndash; or to meet the medical requirements of their children. In reporting these findings, the report does not document the true level of income supports for asylum seeker families in direct provision. Asylum seekers in direct provision are paid £15 per adult and £7.50 per child per week. These payments are in the nature of a basic SWA payment, which is means tested to take into account the benefit of full board and lodging provided in direct provision. All accommodation costs together with the cost of meals &ndash; three main meals and snacks outside mealtimes &ndash; heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Where appropriate, asylum seekers are also entitled to child benefit, once-off &ldquo;exceptional needs payments&rdquo; under the SWA scheme towards the cost of necessary travel, clothes, prams, baby baths, etc., weekly-monthly SWA supplements to cover the costs of nappies and other toiletry needs and allowances under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme. Where asylum seekers meet the relevant criteria, they can claim one parent family payment, disability allowance and non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>As regards the report's findings in relation to food, I would point out that each of the 86 accommodation centres housing asylum seekers is obliged under contract to offer menus which reflect the reasonable ethnic needs of asylum seekers accommodated at the centre. There are approximately 120 nationalities with hugely divergent food and ethnic needs accommodated by the RIA and menus are cycled on at least a seven day basis to ensure variety. In the case of State owned properties and the larger accommodation centres, 28 day menu cycles are in place. The RIA also requires the chef of each accommodation centre to meet on a regular basis with a representative group of asylum seekers to discuss their food requirements and asylum seekers are encouraged to give demonstrations to chefs on the preparation and serving of ethnic dishes. In addition, particular emphasis is laid on meeting to the greatest extent possible the religious needs of asylum seekers. For example, special arrangements are made to cater for the needs of Muslims observing Ramadan.</P>
    <P>The RIA recently organised a series of regional food fora presided over by an executive chef with expertise in ethnic food. All chefs and centre managers were invited to attend these fora where advice was provided on a wide range of issues including the sourcing and traceability of ethnic ingredients, the development of multi-ethnic menu cycles, food preparation and serving of ethnic dishes and dietary and nutritional issues. Cookery demonstrations were also given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Staff from the RIA, including senior management, regularly eat in accommodation centres in order to assess the food on offer and in the vast majority of cases they have expressed themselves satisfied. In centres where it is felt that the food on offer is not of a satisfactory standard the matter is pursued vigorously with the owner-manager of the centre.</P>
    <P>All the 37 family accommodation centres operated by the Reception and Integration Agency were surveyed by the agency subsequent to the publication of the report to ascertain whether they were meeting the needs of children as required by contract. Many of these had either been recently inspected or were scheduled for inspection as part of the normal inspection programme. The survey confirmed that infant formula, infant food, jars of baby food, kettles, fridges, fresh water, school lunches and snacks on return from school are provided as required in all centres. Sterilizers are provided in 16 of the centres with the remainder of the centres reporting that the asylum seekers resident there did not require them as they had purchased their own with the assistance of an exceptional needs payment or are breast feeding. Cots are provided in all centres but a number reported that, for cultural reasons, many African mothers prefer to have babies and toddlers sleeping in bed with them. The survey also established that approximately 90% of mothers had their own baby baths, again purchased with the assistance of exceptional needs payments, while the remainder used the facilities provided at the centre. Microwave ovens are provided in 35 of the 37 centres surveyed and liquidisers are provided in 24 centres although this is not required by contract.</P>
    <P>In relation to the report's findings of chronic overcrowding, I would point out that all accommodation in use by the RIA is subject to compliance with the various statutory provisions, including the Housing Act, 1996, governing accommodation of the type provided to asylum seekers. All accommodation providers and other companies engaged by the State are required under contract (generically approved by the Office of the Attorney General) to ensure that all accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all of the statutory requirements of local authorities and State agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety, general safety and so forth. So far as the needs of babies, children and expectant mothers are concerned, rigorous contractual requirements are imposed on accommodation providers.    </P>
    <P>The RIA has an inspectorate with seven personnel who undertake regular inspections of all centres accommodating asylum seekers. Scheduled, but unannounced, comprehensive all day inspections take place at least twice a year and other unscheduled inspections take place on a random basis. In addition, the agency also has three visiting teams who have been focusing on the larger centres in Cork, Limerick and Galway <Col N="1239" /> cities. Any diminution of standards discovered of foot of such inspections and visits is treated very seriously by the RIA and will, if necessary, result in the termination of contracts.</P>
    <P>To ensure the comfort and well being of all asylum seekers resident in accommodation centres house rules are drawn up by local management and cleared by the RIA. Copies are given to asylum seekers on arrival. Proprietors and operators are encouraged to foster a positive atmosphere in centres and to develop lines of communications with residents with a view to defusing potential tensions before they arise and to engender a sense of &ldquo;home&rdquo; within the centre. This system has operated well and, in general, there have been few serious instances of disturbances in centres. In the event that an asylum seeker continuously causes disruption in a centre, a system of verbal and written warnings is in place. In serious cases &ndash; assaults and threats of violence against staff and other asylum seekers &ndash; the RIA may, in the interests of the safety of staff and residents, transfer the asylum seeker to another centre. In cases where a written warning is issued, the asylum seeker is afforded the opportunity to respond to the agency on the allegations made against him-her.</P>
    <P>In addition, the agency conducts regular clinics throughout the country where asylum seekers are given the opportunity to discuss any issues of concern on a confidential basis. The RIA is engaged in providing comprehensive training for proprietors, operators and their staff, including anti-racism and inter-culturalism training. In this regard, emphasis is laid on the importance of dealing with asylum seekers in a respectful manner and the need for awareness of cultural differences.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to review the system of direct provision. I am satisfied that direct provision is a humane, fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum seeker population. In fact, I would strongly contend that the treatment of asylum seekers in this State is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer anywhere in the world.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that following the tragic events in the USA on 11 September, the European Council held an extraordinary meeting to consider measures to progress the fight against international terrorism and approved a plan of action which included the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the adoption of a common definition of terrorism, the <Col N="1240" /> preparation of a common European list of terrorist organisations and the conclusion of a co-operation agreement between Europol and relevant US authorities.</P>
      <P>At the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December there was an extensive discussion on the proposal for a European arrest warrant which will facilitate the surrender between member states of persons wanted for trial or for the carrying out of a sentence already imposed. Agreement was reached on the proposal between 14 member states, including Ireland. One member state, however, found itself unable to signal agreement to the proposal at the Council.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware from discussion on this matter yesterday, I secured at the Council a number of important inclusions in the text of the proposal which, I believe, contribute to the balance which had to be struck between taking strong action against terrorism while at the same time ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.</P>
      <P>Last week's Council of Justice Ministers reached provisional agreement on an instrument setting out a common definitions for a range of terrorist crimes and minimum sentence thresholds for those offences. Once again, the inclusion of a clause guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms helps to achieve the appropriate balance in this instrument.</P>
      <P>In the margins of last week's Council Europol, authorised by the Council, signed an agreement aimed at strengthening the co-operation between Europol and the US in the fight against serious crime and terrorism.</P>

      <P>On Friday 23 November, 30 so-called Real IRA prisoners in Portlaoise Prison informed the governor that they would not go into their cells at lock up time and that this protest would continue on Saturday and Sunday nights. They stated that the protest was to highlight the issue of compassionate parole. They indicated to the governor, when he informed them that he would have to move them to their cells, that they would resist with force any attempts to do so. They were also joined on their protest by ten prisoners claiming INLA affiliations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 8.45 a.m. on Saturday, 24 November, a control and restraint team from the Prison Service, monitored by independent Garda witnesses, moved the prisoners back to their cells. The officers were unarmed, no batons had been <Col N="1241" /> issued, and all equipment issued was protective. One prisoner required removal to hospital as a precaution and was later discharged. Four prison officers were injured and also taken to hospital but later discharged.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to maintain order and control in a prison if prisoners do not go to their cells at the set times. No prison system in the world could tolerate a situation where prisoners refused to obey the legitimate orders of staff. In particular, by refusing to go into their cells on that night and indeed for the next two nights as well, and in stating that they would resist with force any attempts to put them into their cells, they were, in effect, attempting to take control of the landing and issuing a direct challenge to the authority of the prison governor. This is a situation that simply could not be allowed to continue and, in my view, the response by the prison authorities was proportionate, measured and appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment and has taken a strategic approach to policy development involving both legislative and positive action measures to achieve this end.</P>
      <P>The Government made a critical change in the law in this area with the Employment Equality Act, 1998 which, provides protection for people with disabilities in employment and training against discrimination. The Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Investigations were established to underpin statutory rights under the Act and to provide a means of redress. I am proud to say that this legislation places Ireland ahead of many other member states in the European Community with regard to the protection for people with disabilities against discrimination in employment.</P>
      <P>A further significant development has been the introduction of mainstreaming disability policy which was launched by an Taoiseach in June 2000, requiring that public service bodies which provide services for the public are the same bodies that provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of mainstreaming policy the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS are responsible for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities. Employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy underlining the move from a medical atti<Col N="1242" /> tude to disability to an inclusive economic and social view of disability.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has initiated a number of positive action measures to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These measures include, the launch, in July 2000, of a national supported employment programme which will place up to 800 people with disabilities into employment in the open labour market; funding for a social partner initiative, led by ICTU and IBEC, to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector; increased funding for existing employment supports for employers and for people with disabilities; the introduction of new supports such as disability awareness training grants and employee re-training grants; increased emphasis on progression from vocational training to employment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, people with disabilities can avail of the full range of FÁS programmes and services available to help people prepare for and find employment. Funding for vocational training and employment services targeted at people with disabilities has increased significantly since 1999 and more than £32.5 million is being provided this year alone.</P>
    <P>Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Government Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date. In 1999, the Government established a monitoring committee chaired by my Department to monitor and guide progress towards achievement of this target in the public service &ndash; as distinct from the Civil Service. The committee has supported a number of initiatives over the last two years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among and giving information to chief executives; personnel officers; and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this at the public sector careers expo in April, 2001; commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations, the report of which Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, launched on Thursday, 22 November last.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The Department of Finance has commissioned a study on career progression of people with disabilities in the Civil Service in partnership with my Department and the Civil Service Com<Col N="1243" /> mission. This study will help to inform personal and career development of people with disabilities in the Civil Service, including, if necessary, revisions to the 1994 Civil Service code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In terms of promoting wider employment of people with disabilities, it is important to acknowledge that the mainstreaming process is still in the early stages and service providers, employers, clients and employees are adapting to the new arrangements that were put in place formally in June 2000. I am confident that these new policies supported by the Employment Equality Act, will continue to assist people with disabilities to access training and employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 239 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy for tackling organised crime is one of strong legislation backed up by tough law enforcement measures. This combination has led to significant drug seizures, major organised crime groups being dismantled and the prosecution and imprisonment of a number of prominent criminals. The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, has been particularly successful in tracking and confiscating the proceeds of serious criminal <Col N="1244" /> activity. The activities of organised crime groups, including those involved in drug trafficking, are monitored by various Garda specialist units. In this context, the gardaí maintain close contact with other law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>At a European Union level, the Treaty of Amsterdam provides that one of the Union's objectives shall be to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice. This objective is to be achieved by developing common action among the member states, including in the area of police co-operation, by preventing and combating crime, organised or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In October, 1999 the Tampere European Council agreed on a comprehensive approach to reinforce the fight against serious crime. This included a number of new initiatives designed to foster police co-operation. The EU has also put in place a number of funded programmes to enhance training, exchanges and other contacts between law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>A particularly important advance in EU law enforcement co-operation has been the development of Europol, staffed by police and customs officers from the MS. Europol is essentially a co-ordination centre for the collation, analysis and dissemination of information. It provides authorised law enforcement officers in the MS with access to shared information, including analytical support to investigations into drug smuggling operations.</P>
    <P>At an EU and wider international level, contact with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions involves information and intelligence sharing, along with joint operations which often cross numerous jurisdictions in a single operation. The appointment of Garda liaison officers to Europol and Interpol headquarters and in London, Paris, Madrid and the Hague facilitates this exchange of information and intelligence.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that full co-operation has been received at all times from other jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 228 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945 provide for a scheme of compensation for members of An Garda Síochána who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in relation to the performance of their duties as members of An Garda Síochána and to the dependents of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them. Under Section 6 of the 1941 Act a member of the Garda Síochána who has been maliciously injured may sue the State only by an authorisation issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Before deciding if an applicant should be authorised to apply to the High Court for compensation in respect of the injury, the practice has been for the Minister to consider all medical reports submitted by the applicant together with a report on the incident by the Garda Commissioner and a report on the injury by the chief medical officer of the Garda Síochána. Members are referred to the Garda chief medical officer as soon as a final medical report has been submitted by their solicitors.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,200 applications for compensation being processed under the Acts at present. Approximately 600 of these claims are at an early stage of processing in that various reports have yet to be furnished. The status of the remaining claims are: approximately 180 cases where the member has been examined by the Garda chief medical officer and the Commissioner is preparing a report for submission to the Department; approximately 304 cases for which final medical reports have been received and for which applicants are awaiting examination by the Garda chief medical officer; approximately 120 cases for which the Commissioner's reports, including the Garda chief medical officer's report have been provided and for which a ministerial decision as to the granting of an authorisation is required; 14 cases for which authorisations have recently issued to the applicants' solicitors. I have been advised by the Chief State Solicitor's Office that there are approximately 145 cases with them awaiting a High Court hearing.</P>
      <P>Since 1955 when the current filing system was introduced more than 6,000 Garda compensation files have been opened in relation to the Acts. Unfortunately, records do not exist on claims made prior to 1955. The information sought as regards the year in which outstanding claims were made is not readily available and cannot be ascertained within the timeframe for answering this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A backlog of claims occurred a number of years ago due initially to two judicial review cases <Col N="1246" /> which changed the manner in which claims are processed and then because of the death of a Garda surgeon and the delay in replacing him with the Garda chief medical officer. The Garda chief medical officer is currently addressing the elimination of the backlog. To assist this process, sanction has been sought from the Department of Finance for additional medical assistance for the Garda chief medical officer.</P>
    <P>The operation of the compensation scheme under the Acts was last reviewed in 1997. That review resulted in a recommendation on the establishment of a compensation tribunal to deal with the less serious injuries. The Garda associations, although represented on the committee, have sought to have certain of the committee's recommendations amended. My officials will be meeting with representatives of the associations in the new year after which I propose to bring proposals to Government for consideration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately unavoidable delays can occur where necessary additional enquiries are required, because of the seriousness of the injuries received and the circumstances of the incident. I agree that delays in processing applications for compensation should be avoided where possible and I have requested my officials to review the processes used with a view to streamlining and elimination of delays where possible.</P>

      <P>The person referred to, who is a minor, arrived in the State with her mother and two brothers on 30 August 1999 and sought asylum. Her older brother sought asylum in his own right rather than being linked to the family's case. Her father had previously arrived in the state on 23 March 1999 and sought asylum. Following an interview with both parents, it was concluded by the refugee applications commissioner that the family's application was not such as to entitle them to a declaration as refugees. They were informed of this decision on 18 May 2000. Their subsequent appeal was refused by the refugee appeals tribunal and they were informed of this refusal on 20 September 2001. In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the family in question were informed on 23 November 2001 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Several representations have been received in relation their case and are being considered at present. I expect the file to be submitted to me for consideration very shortly. </P>

As the House will be aware, I established the National Crime Council to focus on crime prevention and crime awareness, and the publication of Crime in Ireland is tangible proof that these issues are being taken forward in a progressive manner. Despite the encouraging downward trend in crime in recent years, there is still a need for analysis and discussion as a further contribution to informed policy making. By focusing not only on crime trends but also on our sources of data on crime, the National Crime Council's report will help bring about a deeper public understanding of the issues involved. The Crime in Ireland report makes a number of recommendations relating to the further development of capacities with regard to crime research <Col N="1248" /> and statistics. I will give full and early consideration to these recommendations, in conjunction with relevant State agencies, including the Garda Síochána.</P>

By way of response to the commission's recommendations relating to improved access to off-licences, the Government noted my intention to bring forward proposals for amending legislation at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work on this new legislation is at an early stage in my Department. Framing this new legislation is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area which the commission itself has acknowledged. For this reason, I am unable to say when the proposals for legislation will be ready for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the recommendations not relating to access to off-licences &ndash; the majority of which fall within the areas of responsibility of other Departments and agencies &ndash; the Government agreed that a co-ordinated response be developed by a high-level, interdepartmental working group of the Departments and agencies concerned. This working group presented its report at the end of June. I am happy to say that the Departments and agencies concerned responded in a broadly positive and constructive way to the commission's recommendations and indicated that they would be taking appropriate action to address them in due course. I understand that such action is under way at present. For example, within my own Department, I have established a review group to examine the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect that it will report to me by the end of the year. To underline the importance it attaches to the work of the Liquor Licensing Commission, the Government has requested the working group to present a progress report on all actions taken by Departments and agencies in response to the interim report's recommendations by 31 January 2002. I understand that the working group will <Col N="1249" /> reconvene shortly with a view to preparing and submitting the progress report requested by Government by this deadline.</P>

      <P>Any allegation of sexual abuse which is made by persons of any age held in prison custody is immediately reported to the Garda Síochána for investigation. I am aware of two cases where prisoners under 18 years of age, both of whom were detained in St. Patrick's Institution, alleged that they had been sexually assaulted while in custody. Both allegations were made in October of 1999 and were levelled against other inmates. The alleged incidents were not related and the alleged perpetrator was different in both cases. One person is facing court appearances in the future and the other investigation is ongoing. In light of this it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on either of these cases. I am not aware of any other instances of alleged sexual abuse occurring in the institutions which are under the control of my Department during my term of office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the information requested in relation to allegations of physical abuse as this could include each instance where one prisoner allegedly strikes another. However, when an assault is reported, an investigation into the matter would take place and the alleged victim is given the opportunity to report the matter to the local gardaí if he-she wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Calibration of taximeters is undertaken by private installation companies who supply and repair taximeters to the trade. Calibration is the process whereby meters are programmed or adjusted to measure time and distance accurately and to calculate the fare payable in accordance with fare structures approved by local authorities. In accordance with the Metrology Act, 1996, operators of taximeters must ensure meters conform to the requirements of the Act. Verification of taximeters is undertaken by the legal metrology service, LMS, upon request by taxi operators. Verification entails checking the accuracy of meters, including the forthcoming conversion of meters to euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conversion of taximeters in the Dublin region to euro by installation companies has commenced. Meters converted in advance of 1 January 2002 will continue to display in punts until that date when they will automatically switch <Col N="1251" /> over to euro. The verification of such meters by the LMS is already under way. Taximeters in Mullingar have been verified for operation in euro from 1 January 2002. Adaptation and subsequent verification of all remaining meters in Dublin and throughout the country to euro will proceed from 2 January 2002. There is no legal requirement for taxi meters to be converted by end 2001. The dual circulation period will continue for a six week period to 9 February 2002.</P>
    <P>An information pack, aimed specifically at the taxi industry, has been prepared by Forfás and is being issued to all taxi licence holders during the week commencing 10 December 2001. The pack includes a euro calculator, IR£ to  ready reckoner, conversion charts and general instructions on the conversion of taximeters to euro. During the dual circulation period this information pack will provide taxi drivers with the information they need to convert IR£ fares to euro where the meter has not yet been converted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. Of course, it is open to any business to increase their prices if they want to do so and changes in prices do occur for various reasons and at different times during the trading year. Successive Governments have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a far better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price control legislation which would require that all price adjustments for all products be approved in advance. The introduction of the euro does not change this fact.</P>
      <P>I believe that the vast majority of traders want to behave honourably and fairly during the changeover to the euro. Some unscrupulous traders may seek to use the introduction of the euro as an opportunity to introduce unwarranted price increases. However, the retail market, in particular, is highly competitive and at the end of the day I believe that the market will punish those who seek to take advantage of the changeover in this way. Consumers need to realise the power that they themselves have if they feel they are not being treated fairly, and that is simply to take their business elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large numbers of traders who have already signed up to the codes of practice on dual display of prices are entitled to display a special logo approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs is evidence of a commitment to carry out the chang<Col N="1252" /> eover fairly. These traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to demonstrate to their customers that they have made a commitment not to seek unfair advantage from the changeover. I would encourage consumers to shop where they see this logo displayed. I also strongly urge retailers who have not yet done so to contact their trade association or the Director of Consumer Affairs without any further delay and sign up to one of the codes of practice on dual display of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many of the workers in Irish Ispat Limited had given several years of service and dedication to the company and it was with dismay that the Government learned of the situation in which the workers found themselves following the closure of the company in June of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to administering the schemes for the workers' statutory redundancy entitlements, details of which are outlined below, my Department applied to the European Commission for re-adaptation aid under Article 56(2)(B) of the European Coal and Steel Community &ndash; ECSC &ndash; Treaty for the provision of funds to enhance the statutory entitlements of the workers. The Commission has recently approved my Department's application for the maximum aid amount of 3,000 or £2,362.69 per worker. The Commission's payment will only apply to workers who have more than one year's service in the company and who also would not have reached normal pensionable age at the time of being made redundant. The Commission has indicated that it should be in a position to transfer these funds during the first few months of 2002. The payment will then be administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of this funding from the European Commission is that the Government should pay a special contribution to the workers which would at least match the funding to be received from the Commission. This special Government contribution of £2,362.69 or 3,000 per worker is in the process of being paid to the former employees and should be received by them within the next few days. The special Government contribution will apply to all the Ispat workers who were made redundant as a result of the closure of the company whereas the European Commission payment is subject to the criteria described above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has paid statutory redundancy payments of a total amount of just over £1.5 mill<Col N="1253" /> ion to 343 of the former Irish Ispat employees from the social insurance fund under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991. A further 47 claims were received in respect of employees who did not meet the required minimum service of two years. These claims were refused and the employees were informed accordingly. In addition, a few more claims have yet to be processed for employees whose services were retained by the liquidator for an extended period. As soon as my Department is informed of the applicable adjusted dates of termination, their claims will be processed. My Department has also processed all claims received from the former employees in respect of wages arrears and holiday pay claims under the insolvency payments scheme in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991. Moneys in respect of these claims have issued to the liquidator for distribution to the former employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to payments of minimum notice compensation awards in accordance with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991, my Department has forwarded the payments awarded by an employment appeals tribunal, within the terms of the insolvency payments scheme, to the liquidator for distribution of the appropriate amount to each individual claimant. I understand that some further claims under the insolvency payments scheme remain to be heard by the tribunal. I have been assured that any further claims received under the scheme will be processed as quickly as possible. To date, the total gross amount paid under the insolvency payments scheme is over £1.19 million.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Act, 2000, enacted by the Oireachtas and signed by the President in December of last year, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that insurance intermediaries be supervised by the Central Bank on broadly the same basis as other financial intermediaries. The regime of self regulation that had applied previously was no longer deemed sufficient to protect the interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>The details of the regime of supervision, including the regulatory handbooks, is a matter for the Central Bank. I understand that the employees of banks are now subject to rules about unsolicited calls, analogous to those applying to all intermediaries. Our Department has asked the insurance industry to observe similar rules. There is no reason that competent intermediaries should not prosper in the new regulatory regime. On the contrary, the regime should increase consumer confidence in dealing with insurance intermediaries.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 2001, do not contain any provisions requiring that health and safety measures be specifically provided for in bills of quantities prepared for building contracts and I have no immediate plans to introduce such measures. The regulations do, however, impose a broad range of other duties and obligations in relation to health and safety on clients, designers, contractors, employers and employees. In addition to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and the General Application Regulations, 1993 and 2001, these regulations provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed. Also, in view of the fact that the construc<Col N="1255" /> tion sector is a recognized high risk area of activity, it is the focus of ongoing targeted attention in terms of inspection and enforcement actions and promotional and partnership activities by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>A partnership approach to safety is essential and it is best embodied by the construction safety partnership, CSP. The CSP is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and other relevant Departments-agencies and is working to a detailed three year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. Progress has been made in a number of areas including the initiation of a safety representatives pilot project, a joint ICTU-CIF project, the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, increased inspection by the Health and Safety Authority, the establishment of a joint ICTU-CIF safety council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities and the recent development of amendments to the construction regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the construction regulations 2001 are extremely significant in that they will introduce, for the first time, the concepts of &ldquo;mandatory safety training&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory safety representation&rdquo; while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. These provisions will take effect from 1 January 2002. In addition, the legislative proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which are at present <Col N="1256" /> being developed at departmental level, will strengthen and update the 1989 Act in relation to a number of areas such as offences and penalties. This will, of course, be of benefit to all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.</P>
    <P>The State, through the provision of a strong legislative base and the provision of associated training, advisory, inspection and enforcement services, plays a full role in the effort to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector. With the continued support and involvement of both sides of industry, and an adherence to their statutory obligations, further improvements can be brought about.</P>

    <P>Regarding the assistance for the indigenous industry sector, the allocated funding will help Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development clients achieve success through a balanced development that builds strength across five key elements: strategy, marketing, finance, human resource development, and production and operations. The allocations will also provide for the development of the seed and venture capital market, the provision of intensive support to start-up companies under the business innovation centres, BICs, and provision of support to businesses at local level under the community enterprise scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards foreign direct investment, FDI, the allocation consists of IDA Ireland capital grants towards such projects, these projects being spread throughout the country on a variety of both existing and new FDI projects. Grants from Shannon Development in respect of FDI refer exclusively to the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
    <P>The productive sector operational programme also contains a range of measures for investment in research, technological development and innovation, RTDI. These measures have been included on the basis that there is clear evidence of the links between investment in RTDI and enhanced economic activity through increased <Col N="1257" /> competitiveness, company growth and new company start-ups. The expenditure involved will be used as a means of enhancing innovation and competitiveness, in order to increase output and employment. This will be achieved through focused support for in-company research and development, the networking of companies with the wider science and technology infrastructure, the better use of technology in balanced regional development and the preparation for the future technological opportunities through the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland.</P>
    <P>The selection of projects by county enterprise boards, to be supported under the regional operational programme measure, will take place on an ongoing basis throughout the year, including the proportions to be allocated for enterprise supports and administration. The employment and human resources development operational programme covers most of the activities of FÁS and thus most of the lines within subhead K are related to the NDP. These cover: projects relating to training for the employed; projects relating to training for the unemployed; costs relating to the management and running of all projects in FÁS; costs of all community employment and job initiative programmes throughout the country; cost of capital expenditure for all areas within FÁS; cost of all local employment service offices throughout the country and related expenditure such as job clubs; cost of all social economy projects throughout the country; cost of certain initiatives related to persons with a disability. Human resource development in client companies of Enterprise Ireland is also covered by this OP.</P>

This standard allows users with disabilities to change the text, font, colours etc. of a web page to make it easier to read. Also, for those with poor or no sight, it allows machine readers to &ldquo;read&rdquo; a web page out loud. The total cost of the redesign of the website was 36,000 or £28,352.30.</P>

      <P>The post-budget allocation for marine and natural resources in 2002 is £242 million or 307 million. While final allocations in respect of the 38 NDP programmes which come within the aegis of my Department have yet to be finalised, it is estimated, on the basis of the indicative requirements submitted to date, that £150 million or 191 million of the 2002 post-budget allocation will be allocated to these programmes. My Department is currently assessing our NDP and other requirements next year with a view to identifying priorities and associated budgetary requirements. Details of the final allocations to be made within the overall post-budget envelope will be available in the revised Estimates for 2002 which will be published early next year.</P>
      <P>Almost £80 million or 101 million will be required in 2002 to support investment under the NDP forestry programmes. The majority of this funding will provide for forestry planting and maintenance grants and income premiums with some £13 million or 16.5 million being earmarked for woodland improvement, harvesting, forest roads, forestry training and forestry RTDI. The recent budget provided for additional investment of almost £16 million or 20 million in fishery harbour infrastructure in 2002. This brings total planned investment next year under this programme to almost £27 million or 34 million. The programme of works for 2002 is being drawn up by my Department and the 2002 fishery harbour development programme will be announced in early 2002.</P>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates provision for coast protection works in 2002 is £4.7 million or 6 million. In October 2001, my Department requested coastal local authorities to submit priority proposals for consideration in the context of the 2002 coast protection programme. These proposals are under consideration at present and a programme of works for 2002 is being drawn up. The 2002 coast protection programme will be announced early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indicative public investment next year under the NDP seafood measures, including fleet development, aquaculture, seafood processing, training and marketing, will amount to almost £14 million or 18 million. The indicative allocation of almost £2 million or 2.5 million for seafood marketing will support the continuation of BIM's trade, market development and consumer support initiatives while BIM's seafood training programme will receive funding of over £1 million or 1.3 million. Indicative funding of over £6.5 million or 8.5 million is earmarked in 2002 for fleet renewal and modernisation, fisheries supporting measures and seafood processing in respect of which I expect to be in a position to make project announcements early next year. Funding of the order of £3.5 million or 4 million will be made <Col N="1261" /> available in 2002 to support aquaculture development. The first tranche of 22 projects under this scheme was announced in September this year.</P>
    <P>The Abridged Estimates allocation for marine research in 2002 is almost £22.5 million or 29 million. My Department is in discussion with the Marine Institute with a view to identifying the proportion of that allocation which will be required to support the NDP marine RTDI measures. It is estimated that £7.6 million or 9.7 million will be required next year to fund the final payments on the new, state-of-the-art marine research vessel while some funding will be required to roll-out the marine RTDI fund and marine laboratory infrastructure initiatives. Indicative funding of £9 million or 11.4 million has been allocated for the seaports measure of the NDP in 2002. I am currently considering recommendations on the allocation of funds to projects and expect to make an announcement in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, EU state aid approval has been granted in respect of all tourism schemes under the NDP. Arrangements are now under way to put in place the two tourism schemes which come within my Department's responsibility, namely, the marine tourism measure and the tourism and recreational angling measure. Calls for application under these schemes will be made in due course. The indicative allocation for marine and angling tourism in general in 2002 is almost £4 million or 5 million. The final allocations for 2002 in respect of the two NDP schemes will be made once the measures have been put in place.</P>

      <P>Pat Finucane was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast on 12 February 1989. Since then, serious allegations have been made concerning collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in this case. On 24 February 2000, following a meeting with the Finucane family, the Taoiseach called for an independent, judicial public inquiry to examine all the circumstances surrounding the murder of Pat Finucane. The Government remains committed to achieving the objective of an independent, judicial inquiry in this case. It is our view that the arrangements proposed in the Weston Park package constitute the best available means to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>At Weston Park, both governments agreed to appoint a judge of international standing to undertake a thorough investigation of the Finucane and five other cases. The judge will be appointed upon the conclusion of current investigations, but not later than April 2002. The governments have promised to abide by the findings and recommendations of the judge, including any recommendations for a public inquiry in any of the cases. The two governments are at present actively seeking a suitable judge of international standing to take on this task.</P>
      <P>I also condemn the murder of William Stobie in Belfast yesterday morning. This brutal act of violence has left another family in mourning. The murder was abhorrent in itself but may also have been an attempt to stifle the search for the truth into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Pat Finucane. It must not be allowed to hinder that search.</P>

      <P>On 1 August, following intensive discussions with the pro-agreement parties at Weston Park, the two governments brought forward a package of proposals to help deliver the full and early implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In making their proposals, both governments reaffirmed their view that the implementation of the agreement is a collective responsibility, and that it can only be achieved in co-operation with the parties in Northern Ireland. For that reason, we suggested that those parties committed to securing full implementation of the agreement might join the governments in an implementation group. There has been some discussion of this proposal with the parties in the period since, and it remains the Government's view that, if the parties were agreeable, such a group could have a valuable role to play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta's proposals in relation to the three State airports are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. The three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork are a vital part of the national transportation infrastructure and perform a vital function as major access points for business and tourism. The State airports have seen a dramatic growth in passenger traffic in recent years, rising by 50% since 1996 to almost 18 million passengers last year.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport accounts for the bulk of the traffic through the State airports. The major extension of the terminal building at the airport is now in place and the integration of this with the older part of the terminal building is scheduled for completion in February. The new enlarged terminal will allow Dublin Airport to cater for up to 20 million passengers annually as against the 14 million passengers using the facility last year. Shannon Airport has a new terminal building which was completed last year with the aim of doubling the annual capacity of the airport to 4.5 million passengers annually.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta will also proceed next year with its major capital investment programme at Cork Airport at an estimated cost of £86 million, 109 million, to provide major new infrastructure and facilities including a major terminal extension and multi-storey car park.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is continuing to plan for the ongoing provision of adequate infrastructure at our airports to cater for traffic, particularly in the second half of the decade. This type of advance planning and preparatory work is vital because of the long lead times involved with major projects and of the need to plan sufficiently well in advance so as to have additional infrastructure available when required.</P>

      <P>The following is the position in relation to projects under the national develop<Col N="1266" /> ment plan in the transport, energy and communications areas.</P>
      <P>The Book of Estimates for 2002 provides £112 million for rail safety, £100 million for light rail and £76 million for public transport investment. As part of the budget day announcements, an additional £45 million is being provided by way of Exchequer funding. In total, £333 million is being provided by the Exchequer, compared with £271 million in 2001, an increase of 23% on last year. This Exchequer funding has been allocated as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £112 million in respect of the railway safety programme will enable Íarnrod Éireann to continue to expand their investment programme of track renewal and upgrading of signalling, bridge renewal, level crossings improvements and improved safety management, across the entire network; £110 million has been allocated to the Rail Procurement Agency of which £10 million will be used to meet the set up costs of the agency. The balance of £100 million is being allocated to fund the development of the LUAS project which will see services commence in late 2003; over £111 million will be utilised to progress a number of projects in 2002. EU co-funding will also be provided in respect of a number of these projects. The projects include: a major expansion of Heuston Station facilities and capacity to accommodate increased frequency of mainline and suburban trains with extra platforms, signalling and improved passenger facilities. This investment will form part of the Kildare line upgrade; continued funding of the DART upgrade project including the final payment on 12 DART cars to go into service next spring. The next phase in the DART expansion involves upgrading platforms, signalling and power supply to enable 8-car DARTS operate on the system. It will also allow for extra slots in the area of Connolly Station/Pearse Station for additional trains from the Northern and Maynooth lines; In 2002, Iarnród Éireann will start taking delivery of 80 diesel rail cars to be used mainly on the outer suburban rail system. In addition, a rail depot at Drogheda will be constructed for the maintenance of these trains; both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus will continue with their fleet development and enhancement programmes; Iarnród Éireann are in the process of tendering for new mainline carriages to replace old rolling stock and expect to place orders for these carriages in the new year; funding has been allocated to community-based pilot projects to assist in the development of rural transport under the rural transport initiative; funding is also being provided for projects which will help the mobility impaired in accessing public transport facilities and vehicles, including making further progress on improvements to rail station lifts and foot bridges; funding is being provided to the light rail project office/Railway Procurement Agency to further develop an integrated ticket<Col N="1267" /> ing system for the greater Dublin area; and funding is also being provided for improved facilities for public transport customers in terms of reliable and up-to-date information. Information technology will be central to these new customer facilities. Some funding is also being provided for transport research.</P>
    <P>The physical and financial progress of the above projects will be closely monitored by the NDP monitoring committee established early last year by my Department and made up of representatives from my Department, Department of Finance, CIE holding group and the three subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>An amount of £4.73 million has been allocated in the 2002 Abridged Estimates for my Department in respect of all capital works at the regional airports. This includes provision for the completion of a runway project at Galway Airport and for the airports measure of the NDP. The type of projects which have been submitted for consideration falls into two broad categories: safety/security e.g. fire tenders/equipment in respect of hold baggage screening and upgrades and improvements of infrastructural works e.g. improvements to car parking facilities/passenger facilities.</P>
    <P>No formal decisions on project selection under the NDP have been made to date but my Department is continuing its examination of the project submissions forwarded by the airports and it is anticipated that approval of a number of projects will issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>As part of the 2002 Abridged Estimates, the sum of £7.3 million has been allocated to my Department for the promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy measures. In the energy sector, a key priority of the national development plan is to identify those areas of expenditure which will assist Ireland in complying with its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre is the main implementing body for measures relating to <Col N="1268" /> energy efficiency and renewable energy and the Estimates allocation will be expended by them in a range of activities such as public sector building, research and development in energy efficient housing, renewable energy and public awareness.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, the Government has put in place a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the roll-out of regional broadband. While the telecommunications market is liberalised, certain interventions have taken place to address the issue of market failure in the delivery of broadband services. Funding made available in the 2002 estimates of £20 million and additional funding made available in the budget of £15 million will be used to extend and develop these initiatives under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. It is particularly appropriate at a time when the private telecommunications sector is undergoing a period of capital expenditure retrenchment. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas with the objective of balanced regional development and the enabling of e-commerce.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1999, new licensing guidelines were announced involving a more open approach towards applications for route licences by private operators in the greater Dublin area, specifically in relation to applications for orbital, radial and feeder routes. Since then, 22 annual passenger licences have been issued to private sector operators in the greater Dublin area, in line with the <Col N="1270" /> more open policy approach towards the development of new services by private sector operators.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on pay claims by Dublin Bus drivers in May 2000 included a recommendation regarding the subcontracting of bus services. Bus Átha Cliath subsequently incorporated this recommendation into an agreement with their staff unions. I understand progress is being made on the implementation of this recommendation by Bus Átha Cliath. However, I have no function with regard to contractual issues, which is a day to day function of the company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation paper, &ldquo;A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport,&rdquo; published in September 2000, outlined the Government's proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of the public transport system. <Col N="1271" /> In particular, the paper proposed the introduction of competition for the bus market in Dublin through a franchising system for routes or groups of routes, with market entry regulated by an independent public transport regulator.</P>
    <P>Recognising the significance of the changes proposed, the publication of this paper was followed by an extensive period of consultation with the social partners, in particular the Public Transport Partnership Forum. At the request of the forum, I extended the consultation period in order to allow it to carry out independent research to assist it in making a formal statement of its views in response to the paper. I understand that the consultants engaged by the forum have now reported and I expect that the forum will shortly conclude its consideration of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of all submissions received on the consultation paper, I will finalise my proposals for submission to the Government on regulatory reform. In the meantime, priority is being given to the preparation of legislation to establish a strategic authority for the greater Dublin area, under the auspices of a cross-departmental team led by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Proposals for such a body were set out in a Government consultation paper &ldquo;Institutional Arrangements for Land Use and Transport in the Greater Dublin Area.&rdquo; It is proposed that this strategic body will have responsibility for the regulation of public transport. I therefore have no interim proposals to advertise routes for public tender or establish a temporary regulatory body.</P>

      <P>A committee chaired by my Department and including representatives from CIE, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann, the light rail project team of CIE and the Dublin Transportation Office was established in late 1998 to prepare proposals for an integrated fares and ticketing system. These proposals were finalised and noted by the Government in November 2000. Copies of the report are available on my Department's website, www.irlgov.ie/tec. I am also arranging to forward the report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Following the committee's report, my Department in early 2001 requested the light rail project office to develop an integrated ticketing project. In August 2001, an outline project plan was agreed with the LRPO which is proceeding with the work in that regard. The work of the LRPO will shortly be subsumed into the Railway Procurement Agency. The project plan is taking the project from design to launch incorporating procurement, installation, commissioning and roll out.</P>

      <P>The allocation of the Exchequer subvention to the individual subsidiary companies is a matter for the CIE board. The subvention is paid to the CIE Group to meet the cost of providing socially necessary but commercially non-viable public transport services.</P>
      <P>The subvention provided to the CIE Group of companies in respect of 2001 has been increased by an additional £16 million, 20 million, by way of a Supplementary Estimate. This brings the total for the year to £175.060 million, 222.28 million. The table sets out the allocation of the subvention on a company by company basis, the projected passenger numbers and the projected passenger miles-vehicle kilometres for each service where available:</P>

The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the civil defence branch of my Department to Roscrea, County Tipperary. It is anticipated that the relocation will take place next year. In this regard, five officers have expressed a willingness to transfer to Roscrea.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 12 cows under the 2001 <Col N="1277" /> suckler cow premium scheme. In 2000 his herd was selected for inspection and non-compliance with identification and registration requirements was found. The herdowner was informed that his herd would be inspected again within 24 months. At this second inspection it was found that the person named did not have 12 cows, as applied on for 2001, but had eight cows and four heifers. As he had not used his 20% heifer facility, two of the heifers were accepted and the other two were rejected as ineligible. In calculating the penalty in this case, the fact that the person named had only quota for nine cows was overlooked. This error has been corrected and the applicant has been notified accordingly. Payment will issue as soon as possible for nine animals subject to an identification and registration penalty of 6.25% because one animal on the farm was found tagged but not recorded on the herd register. My Department contacted the person named on 16 November 2001 regarding this matter.</P>

Grant aid for this type of investment is available under the current alternative enterprise scheme. The level of grant aid available is set at 40% for applicants with not more than 150 income units and 20% in respect of applicants with not more than 200 income units. The maximum level of investment eligible for aid is 6,349 or £5,000. This level of aid is similar to that available under previous schemes and there has been no reduction in the maximum level of eligible investment. I am, however, considering the possibility of increasing the eligible investment level at present and, if this seems justified, the matter will be pursued further with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for a premium for four cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. In processing the application for payment, further checks were required regarding the breed of animal tag number PPA507061. As this matter is not resolved, the case will now be processed for payment for three animals. Payment will issue shortly. At balance payment stage, his entitlement will be calculated on the basis of four animals, provided the valid breed for the aforementioned animal is established and is acceptable under the scheme.</P>

As no area aid application was received from the person named for 2001, no disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme payment can be made for 2001.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the transfer lists maintained for clerical officer and staff officers under General Council Report 782. The following schedule gives the numbers of applications from staff in my Department who have indicated that they wish to transfer to locations outside Dublin by grade and location. These lists are not an accurate reflection of current interest in a location as frequently the applicants' circumstances have changed by the time their place is reached on the list. In the effort to arrive at an up-to-date indication of interest for provincial locations, the Department of Finance has recently directed that all applicants renew their application. These returns are currently being collated by all Departments and it is anticipated the task should be completed by end January 2002.</P>

      <P>The compensation applied to herds depopulated as a result of BSE is set out in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1990 &ndash; S.I. No. 195 of 1990. Article 4 of this order provides that the compensation payable shall be an amount equal to the market value of the animal. This is further clarified in article 4(3) where &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is defined as the price that might reasonably have been obtained for the animal at the time of its slaughter from a purchaser in the open market. BSE compensation is assessed on the market value of the relevant animals, based on data gathered by my Department in relation to the VAT inclusive prices obtainable for similar animals at marts and sales. Accordingly, the question of a <Col N="1285" /> further payment in respect of VAT does not arise.</P>

Statistics for November and December are not yet available. This figure shows a significant increase over previous years.

Three staff are currently assigned to maintain the website, two of whom do so on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>The cost of the maintenance of the website is wholly related to the provision of staff and will be approximately £70,680 for 2001, based on the standard Department of Finance calculation of staff costs.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation. They have particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically, at ports, airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that within the Customs and Excise enforcement branch there is a dedicated team of specialist customs officers which focuses specifically on drug smuggling, supported by the general cadre of the Customs and Excise Service. A number of years ago Revenue introduced a memorandum of understanding initiative, which involved reaching agreement with a number of organisations, trade associations and individual companies in the transport industry to encourage them to join the <Col N="1286" /> fight against drug smuggling as part of the Customs and Excise Drugs Watch programme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on specific operations in the criminal area of drug smuggling. However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the Drugs Watch programme incorporates a coastal and airfield reporting system whereby local Revenue officers visit all licensed aerodromes-airfields regularly. They have also put in place a confidential system of communication between the licensed aerodrome operators and the Customs enforcement branch. Through this network, which is two-way, officers have discussed with the operators such matters as known methods used by drug smugglers and indicators of suspicious activity. This can help the operators in identifying situations and activities that may indicate a drug smuggling operation is under way and which they should report. This reporting system is an important element in the fight against drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>Best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug smuggling. In Ireland, this has become increasingly important since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, based as it is on the free movement of goods and people within the Community. In addition to local intelligence, Revenue shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies including the World Customs Organisation, United Nations Drug Control Programme, Interpol, Council of Europe, Europol and the UK's National Criminal Intelligence Service.</P>
      <P>Revenue liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service and Air Corps, and foreign customs and police services. It takes part on a regular basis in European, bilateral and national surveillance operations focused at specific drug smuggling methodologies, including general aviation. Some of these operations have been specifically directed at light aircraft and helicopter movements.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease last February, Revenue has stepped up customs controls at all major ports and airports including licensed airstrips to monitor movements of goods and persons. These operations are ongoing.</P>
      <P>Through a system of risk analysis and profiling, Revenue operational resources in anti-smuggling activities are deployed to counteract the areas of greatest risk. The Revenue Commissioners keep all operations of the Customs and Excise enforcement branch under review, including its drug smuggling operations. The Commissioners are currently implementing the recommendations of a detailed review of the enforcement branch designed to strengthen the enforcement capability of the office.</P>

      <P>The Quarterly National Household Survey for June-August 2001 indicated the following: employment increased by 48,700 or 2.8%, unemployment increased by 1,800 to a rate of 4.3%, (not seasonally adjusted), and the labour force increased by 50,500 or 2.8%.</P>
      <P>Of the increase in the labour force of 50,500, participation contributed 6,800 while the balance arose from demographic change. While the increase in the labour force of 50,500 was somewhat higher than in the previous 12 months, 45,300, and in comparison with the yearly increase to the previous quarter, March-May 2001, 36,300, the underlying trend is downward, because of a declining birth rate and declining rates of contribution from participation and migration.</P>
      <P>Unemployment increased by 1,800 year-on-year to June-August 2001. The annual increase in unemployment of 1,800 reflected an increase of 5,300 in short-term unemployment, while long-term unemployment fell by 3,600. While there was a quarterly increase of 14,100 between the second and third quarters of 2001 which was substantially larger than the increase of 2,800 recorded between the second and third quarters of 2000, this reflected a more rapid increase in the labour force in the period Mar-May 2001 to June-August 2001. Even though unemployment grew in the year to June-August 2001, it should be noted that employment growth in the same period was faster than that experienced in the year to March-May 2001.</P>
      <P>Employment grew by 48,700 year-on-year to June-August 2001 compared with growth of 45,800 in the year to the previous quarter, March-May 2001, indicating that the slowdown in economic activity had not led to any significant deterioration in employment performance to mid-year. In comparison with international developments, Irish employment growth was strong to mid-year.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 1999, introduced accelerated capital allowances of up to 100% for capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of park and ride developments in or near designated urban areas which provide parking facilities for commuters using public transport. Relief is also avail<Col N="1288" /> able for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of related residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities. Guidelines on the operation of the scheme were issued by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in August 1999. The guidelines set out various criteria which a park and ride development and residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities must meet in order to qualify under the scheme. Certification of a development for the purposes of obtaining relief under the scheme is carried out by the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1999, also provided for capital allowances for commercial developments located at these park and ride facilities. Guidelines in relation to the commercial development element of these park and ride facilities were issued in July 2001 after discussions with EU Commission officials on state aid rules. Furthermore, the Finance Act, 2001, provides that a qualifying commercial premises is one used for the supply of local goods and services.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Dublin Transport Office that there is a park and ride project in the planning stages for the Malahide Road. The scheme was originally to operate for three years from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2002. However, in my recent budget I extended the qualifying period by a further two years to 30 June 2004 to allow for further projects to come on-stream.</P>

      <P>A home carer's tax credit, amounting to £600, 770, is available in respect of those spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed to tax and where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependent persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. In general, all income is taxable including the majority of social welfare payments. The invalidity pension payable by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is regarded as taxable income. Where the home carer has income in his or her own right, there still may be an entitlement to the tax credit. <Col N="1289" /> The tax credit is due in full where the home carer's income is less than £4,000, 5,080, per annum. Where the carer's income is between £4,000, 5,080 and £5,200, 6,604, the tax credit is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income so that where the income exceeds £5,200, 6,604, there is no entitlement to any tax credit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,960 million, £3,906 million, in Government bonds and medium and long-term loans are due to be redeemed in 2002. This maturing debt will be refinanced by the issue of new debt.</P>
      <P>The value of bonds issued over the last five years is as follows: 1997: 4,068 million (£3,204 million); 1998: 2,411 million (£1,899 million); 1999: 1,728 million (£1,361 million); 2000: 969 million (£763 million); 2001: Debt maturing this year is being refinanced primarily through the issuance of short-term debt. The details of the exact sources of the 2001 refinancing will be made available in early January 2002.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the NTMA carried out a securities exchange programme in 1999. This involved the exchange of outstanding bonds with high interest coupons for new bonds with lower interest coupons close to market rates. The purpose of the programme was to make Irish Government bonds more competitive in the post EMU environment. The programme increased the nominal value of the National Debt by 3,428 million, £2,700 million. This rise was offset by a drop in interest costs and the overall effect was to leave the market value of the debt unchanged.</P>
      <P>Of course, the amount of bonds issued in a particular year is not an indicator of the change in the level of the National Debt in that year. The change in the level of the National Debt is a function of a number of factors, primarily each year's Exchequer balance. At end 2000 the debt stood at 36,511 million, £28,755 million, compared with 37,979 million, £29,911 million at end 1996. The end 2000 figure includes the effect of the securities exchange programme referred to above without which the figure would be 3,428 million, £2,700 million, lower.</P>

      <P>I understand that the local government (superannuation consolidation) scheme referred to by the Deputy makes provision for waiving the abatement of pension in certain specified circumstances. In applying this provision my Department must take cognisance of the advice of the Department of Finance, which has overall responsibility for the conduct of public sector superannuation schemes, in relation to possible implications for the local government superannuation scheme in particular and public sector superannuation schemes in general. My Department is, however, continuing to keep the appropriate application of the relevant waiver provision under review, including in relation to any anomalies arising, in the context of the implementation process for the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. This is being undertaken in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which currently administers the superannuation scheme for health board employees.</P>

      <P>In 1994 my Department produced a health services waste policy aimed at reducing the impact on the environment of waste arising in the public health service and improving conditions for those handling the waste. The policy set out basic principles relating to the generation and management of waste, including the segregation of waste into domestic waste and the potentially hazardous fraction known as health care risk waste. A strategy of using non-incineration, shredding and decontamination technology has been pursued for the health care risk waste.</P>
      <P>Health care risk waste from virtually all publicly funded health care agencies is now disposed of through a national contract. The contract specification covers the collection, treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste to the highest environmental and health and safety standards. Most health care risk waste is now processed in disinfection treatment plants which operate under Environmental Protection Agency licences. The main plant operating under the national contract is located in west County Dublin. The sterilised residue is disposed of to a licensed commercial landfill site under strict conditions. The non-risk waste follows the disposal route of municipal or commercial waste to authorised landfills throughout the country. The arrangements for the storage and disposal of radioactive waste arising from the administration of healthcare services in hospitals are the responsibility of the individual hospital authorities. These responsibilities are discharged under licences issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the valuable service rendered by informal family carers, I have made available additional financial allocations to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, for the purpose of supplying specific help to such carers by way of respite and assistance in the home. I hope to continue this initiative in future years. The amounts so provided were £1 million (1.27 million) for 1999, £1 million (1.27 million) for 2000 and £2 million (2.54 million) for 2001. Additional funding of £0.812 million (1.03 million) will be provided in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £5.928 million (7.527 million) has been allocated for home help development in the period 1999-2002, inclusive, and £9.287 million (11.79 million) has been allocated, in respect of the same period, for community supports. Both of these provisions substantially improve the position of carers. I also <Col N="1295" /> provide core funding of £465,000 (571,500) per annum to the Carers' Association which was established to support informal family carers. I should add that many of the initiatives that are set out in the recently launched health strategy will ease the burden of informal family carers and I mention, in particular the provision of greatly increased numbers of respite and day care places.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the motorised transport grant which is administered by the health boards, as opposed to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The motorised transport grant was introduced in 1968 and the guidelines were reviewed and modified in February and March 1974. The purpose of this grant is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain or retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this grant applicants must have a disability which impedes their use of public transport, must hold a driving licence, must be physically and mentally capable of driving and the grant must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain or retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
      <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his/her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board. The motorised transport grant is means tested. The maximum grant is currently £3,300 (4,190.14) and will rise to £3,441.65 (4,370) from 1 January 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question about the suitability of cars for people with disabilities and road safety, the deputy will be aware that all car owners are required to ensure that their cars com<Col N="1296" /> ply with established safety requirements as laid down by law. All cars over five years old must be tested, and meet the requirements of the national car test. The essential issue for disabled drivers is not the suitability of the car <i>per se</i>, but of any adaptations to the car. It is important that adaptations to a car meet the specific needs of the person with a disability who will be driving that car. Both the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers' Association can arrange for professional advice for individuals on this matter.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance was introduced by way of circular 24/73 and is administered by the health boards on my behalf. The guidelines were modified by way of circular 8/78 and letters of 8 December 1999 and 16 March 2001. DCA is paid in respect of children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. The current rate of payment is £129.40, 164.30, per month. This rate will increase to 179.80 per month, with effect from 1 January 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the following changes to the DCA scheme were announced in the budget on 6 December 2000 and came into effect from 1 April 2001: the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> payment in respect of periods spent at home (e.g. weekends and holidays) by eligible children who normally reside in special schools or institutions and the abolition of the DCA require<Col N="1298" /> ment that the disability must have been present for 6 months prior to the date of application. From 1 April 2001 children may become eligible from birth. The allowance is now payable with effect from the date of application.</P>
    <P>Occasionally payments may be backdated prior to the date of application if it is clear that the applicant was not aware of his/her entitlement. In these cases payment of the allowance may be backdated to the date that the child would have become eligible, if the applicant had been aware of his/her entitlement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the special housing aid scheme for the elderly is operated by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which funds it.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for the operation of the scheme are determined by a task force which is chaired by an officer of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That Department has informed my Department that there is no regulation or instruction in relation to this scheme which defines &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; as exactly 65 years or over. This is a deliberate policy to allow some flexibility to health boards to grant aid some persons who might be slightly under the 65 years mark. However, in the final analysis, it is up to each health board to apply the age limit as it considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>My Department has also made specific inquiries of the Western Health Board as to how it operates the scheme in its area. The board states that the scheme is designed to provide basic housing repairs for older persons, those 65 years and over, who live alone or with spouse or family who are also elderly. However, persons under 65 years of age are not automatically debarred from the scheme but such applications are only considered where there are extenuating circumstances. Each application is assessed on its merits and, bearing in mind the health of the applicant and if the housing conditions require urgent repairs, it can be deemed eligible. This would apply, in particular, in the case of intellectually disabled people living in the community, who would not be in a position to carry out repairs to their house.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked the Western Health Board to send to the Deputy details on the special housing aid scheme for the elderly that is distributed by the board's Mayo community services division.</P>

      <P>The development of health related services, including regional assessment and treatment centres, for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities. Voluntary sector service providers, including Enable Ireland, and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees. A copy of the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office, this Government has allocated just over 175 million (£138 million) for the maintenance and development of health related services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In the recent budget, I allocated additional ongoing funding of 15.24 million for services within the sector. This funding is being directed at a number of areas, such as priorities identified by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. This will include a range of support services such as residential, respite, home supports, including personal assistance services, and therapy services. The range of services provided will vary according to local needs.</P>
      <P>Funding will also go towards addressing the under-resourcing of the voluntary sector service providers and the replacement of staff formerly provided under the FÁS community employment scheme. This funding is in addition to the 15.29 million which is being made available in 2002 for the full year costs of 2001 development funding and identified existing service needs in the sector.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that this level of funding is indicative of this Government's ongoing commitment to the delivery of quality health services to those who need them most and I wish to inform the Deputy that the ongoing development of services in the sector will remain one of my highest priorities.</P>

      <P>The total capital funding provided to my Department for health capital projects under the national development plan for 2002, as part of the Abridged Estimates and the recent Budget Statement, is 485.5 million. This will allow for continued and significant development of health infrastructure under the plan next year and includes initiatives relating to acute hospitals, the disabled, older persons, mental health, community health, and the enhancement of services for children requiring care and protection.</P>
      <P>The plan also provides for significant investment in the important areas of refurbishment/re-equipment, information and communication technology and education facilities for nursing services. The prioritisation and delivery of projects under the NDP is, in the first instance, a matter for health boards in agreement with my Department.</P>
      <P>Given the scope of my Department's current capital programme, and the fact that many smaller capital initiatives are undertaken by health boards at local level, it would not be possible to detail all the projects comprised in the NDP for 2002. However, examples of projects that will be progressed include University College Hospital Galway, phase II, completion of Mayo General Hospital, phase II, continuing works at St. Vincent's University Hospital, St. James's Hospital and James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin, development of Naas General Hospital, Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles &ndash; (older persons) &ndash; acute psychiatric units in Sligo General Hospital, St. Luke's, Kilkenny, Ennis General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital &ndash; mental health &ndash; services for the disabled at St. Ita's, Portrane &ndash; disability services &ndash; Nenagh Health Centre &ndash; community health &ndash; Dingle Community Hospital &ndash; older persons &ndash; community nursing unit for older persons and health centre, Birr, high support units-special care units for children at Castleblaney, County Monaghan, Ballydowd, County Dublin, Portrane, County Dublin and Limerick, and community care headquarters and health centre, Tralee.</P>
      <P>Of the total funding provided next year, a sum of 40 million has been earmarked for priority initiatives arising from the new health strategy. These include bed capacity, facilities for older people and the disabled, information technology and a number of primary care initiatives including the new primary care model.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, a dentist from the South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; SEHB &ndash; commenced training in October 2001 for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of <Col N="1306" /> a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million, 1.27 million, was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £0.15 million, 0.19 million, has been approved to the SEHB for orthodontic services this year, of which £0.100 million, 0.127 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This has enabled the health board to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the SEHB has informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 462 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment and the average waiting time for treatment is 12 months. The chief executive officer of the SEHB has also informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, the number of patients in orthodontic treatment was 1,978 which was an increase of 129 on the previous quarter.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>
      <P>The strategy sets out a blueprint for ambitious and wide-ranging change across the whole health system over the next seven to ten years and is underlined by a set of comprehensive targets. In setting out such a comprehensive and large-scale plan, it is inevitable that prioritising of actions must take place. The strategy represents a clear plan for moving forward which is based on a step-by-step approach to reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population. This Government has now set out a comprehensive programme for delivering high-class and accessible health care for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equity in health care is about a full range of services and supports and goes well beyond the issue of income guidelines for medical cards. It is a core principle on which the strategy is based and one which this Government is committed to addressing in the implementation of the strategy <Col N="1311" /> and through service developments across the board. The overriding necessity in relation to equity is the need for access to services.</P>
    <P>Services have to be built up, waiting lists reduced, activity increased and specific groups such as children and those with disabilities require targeted service developments if equity is to be served in a meaningful way. A broad strategic focus is essential to deal with these sort of problems and no single narrow approach will address the real need for better more equitable health care services for all. I have already stated that in 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system will be: 650 additional acute hospital beds; addressing waiting lists through a new treatment purchase fund; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability and; services for older people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of its contract the national car testing service, NCTS, is required to meet certain performance standards which include average and maximum waiting times for test appointments countrywide and on a test-centre-by-test-centre basis. Failure to meet the required standards may result in financial and other penalties for the company. My Department continuously monitors service delivery with reference to all of the specified standards. As a result I am aware of the difficulties referred to in the question. These are in part attributable to demand management problems associated with the industrial action at NCTS earlier this year. To deal with the situation in the short-term, the requirement to present a test certificate when applying for a tax disc for a car that is liable to be tested has been temporarily suspended. It will be reinstated once my Department is satisfied that the company is in a position to schedule and carry out tests in accordance with the specified performance standards.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, I consider that the new taxi licensing regime is bringing significant benefits to the public through the increased availability of taxis. In the Dublin taximeter area the number of licensed taxis has more than doubled and major increases have also taken place throughout the country. Dublin Corporation, as the largest taxi licensing authority in the country, has engaged consultants to carry out a customer service assessment so as to compare current service levels with those obtaining during the last such assessment in 1998 and to identify potential areas for further service improvement. I anticipate that the final report of this study will provide more broadly based and up to date information on the level of taxi services in Dublin and on the impact of the liberalisation of taxi services under the new regime. I have not received submissions on this matter from other licensing authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment of approximately £24 billion, 30 billion, at current prices in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006. Of the total planned infrastructural investment, approximately £19 billion, 24 billion, is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including national and non-national roads, water and waste water, housing, waste management and urban and village development.</P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates for my Department for 2002, published on 15 November, together with the additional allocations announced in the budget, provide for increased spending by my Department in 2002 of just under 9% over the 2001 revised Estimates provision including a Supplementary Estimate. The additional 300 million that was provided for infrastructure programmes in the budget brings my Department's provision for capital spending for 2002 to almost 2.75 billion, which represents an increase of 12.5% on this year's final capital provision. Taking account of the already unprecedented volume of investment in NDP infrastructure programmes, this level of funding will ensure a continuation of activity at a high level under these programmes and reflects the Government's commitment to the implementation of the NDP.</P>
      <P>The additional funding for national roads brings the total 2002 provision for the national roads improvement and maintenance programme to over 1 billion, or in excess of 2.7 million per day. This maintains investment in the national road network at a very high level &ndash; more than three times higher than the 1997 level of 324 million. This investment will fund building, planning and design projects for the upgrading of the national roads network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in water and waste water services will reach a level of almost 490 million next year, which will fund continued progress on major waste water schemes in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Galway as well as protection and upgrading of rural water supplies. The budget also saw an increase in the provision for capital grants for waste management to just under 30 million <Col N="1317" /> which will provide funding in 2002 for a waste management capital infrastructure investment programme that I intend to introduce in the near future.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided an additional 146 million for social housing, bringing the overall Exchequer provision for this purpose to 1.1 billion. This will ensure that some 6,000 local authority houses will be completed or acquired next year. The detailed programming, planning and implementation of individual infrastructure projects is the responsibility of local authorities and, in the case of national roads, the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <Quest>the value of the rate support grant which was introduced to replace rates on private residences, abolished in 1977; the index which has been used over the years to arrive at its current value; and the shortfall of its present value from the amount that would be payable to local authorities had it been indexed in accord with the annual rate struck by local authorities during the intervening years.</Quest>

      <P>The total amount of rate support grant paid in 1978, the year of its introduction, amounted to 100.69 million, £79.3 million.

      <P>In reality, comparison with the 1978 selection is impracticable given the adjustments made to the structure of the rate support grant over the years, for example, in relation to the discontinuation of rates on agricultural land; the elimination of statutory demands on local authorities; the writing off of loan charges under the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, etc. and fundamental changes in central funding in respect of discretionary local authority expenditure including, <i>inter alia</i>, the abolition of the rate support grant in 1997, and the significant funding now given to non-national roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of specific schemes of assistance which are designed to meet accommodation costs, such as nursing home charges. A nursing home subvention is available from the health boards towards meeting the costs of nursing home care. In addition, most nursing homes are approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of obtaining tax relief on fees paid. In the circumstances, it is not considered necessary to provide additional assistance towards nursing home charges by way of disregarding those charges under the means-tested old age, non-contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>However, if, as a consequence of the operation of the provisions of the nursing home subvention scheme, the spouse of the person who goes into nursing home care is left with no income or insufficient income to meet their day-to-day living expenses, then this would be a matter which should more properly be addressed, in the first instance, by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a carer's allowance on 6 September 2001. The conditions for receipt of carer's allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided to the care recipient and that the means test is satisfied. The medical evidence submitted with the application was insufficient to determine whether the care recipient requires full-time care and attention. Arrangements are therefore being made for the care recipient to attend a medical examination by a medical assessor of my Department. The care recipient will be notified of the date, time and venue for this examination shortly.</P>
      <P>When the result of this medical examination is to hand, her entitlement to carer's allowance will be further examined and she will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>In relation to grades represented by the Civil and Public Service Union, clerical officer and staff officer, transfer lists are maintained by the Department for 48 separate locations outside Dublin in accordance with centrally agreed arrangements. These lists include names of civil servants in the grades concerned from all Government Departments or offices who wish to move laterally from one location to another. Based on the most recent information, <Col N="1323" /> the overall number on these transfer lists is in the region of 7,500. It should be noted, however, that it would not be unusual for the same person to be on transfer lists for a number of locations and to have made applications to other Government offices with offices in the provinces.</P>
      <P>Details of locations involved and numbers in the grades concerned seeking to transfer to these locations are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>On foot of new centrally agreed arrangements for the clerical officer grade, transfer lists for the grade are being updated at the present time and it is expected that this process will be completed early in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>the length of time applicants have to wait to have their oral hearing heard in relation to social welfare appeals in the Galway area, particularly appeals that are going to oral hearing; the frequency of visits by the appeals officer to Galway; the number of cases the appeals officer deals with when he goes to Galway; the number of days they sit in Galway; when the next visit by the appeals officer will be to Galway to conduct oral hearings; and the length of time applicants are waiting to have their appeals heard in the Galway area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures are not readily available on the time taken to process appeals in the Galway area. The average time taken to dispose of all appeals dealt with by the social welfare appeals office is 22 weeks. Appeals which can be determined by appeals officers on the basis of the documentary evidence or by way of a revised decision by the deciding officer would be cleared more speedily but those where an oral hearing is required to resolve elements of conflict would be above the average figure. It is not expected cases in County Galway would vary much from the national figure. The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. There is an inevitable time-lag in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>Average appeal processing times have been broadly maintained during recent years. While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvements in processing times is a major objective of the office. It is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with, or at a cost to, the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>
      <P>Appeals officers have held hearings in County Galway for all or part of 60 days during 17 weeks this year. Appeals officers deal with the full range of social welfare questions including unemployment, incapacity, insurability, disability, old age and carers' needs. Some are more complex than others and the number of cases dealt with in any session would have regard to the issues arising. The oral hearing process is designed to ensure that the appellant fully understands the question for determination, that he or she is afforded every opportunity to question the basis of the decision and to present his or her appeal fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the 60 days on which oral hearings were held in County Galway, a total of 363 cases were scheduled. The next occasion on which an appeals <Col N="1325" /> officer is scheduled to be in Galway is during the week commencing 14 January 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for both invalidity pension and disability allowance from my Department. While he satisfies the medical eligibility criteria for both schemes, in the case of his invalidity pension application, he does not satisfy the prescribed PRSI conditions for receipt of payment. In the case of his disability allowance application, his means, which are derived from his spouse's earnings, are in excess of the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>Accordingly he was refused entitlement to either payment and was duly notified of these decisions. He subsequently appealed these decisions to the social welfare appeals office but his appeals were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeal officers. I would like to emphasise that these officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</P>
      <P>The issue as to whether self-employed people should have access to payments, such as invalidity pension in respect of long-term incapacity, has been raised in the context of this case. Any extension of invalidity pension or other benefits to self-employed contributors would have major financial implications and would require substantial changes in the social insurance arrangements generally for the self-employed.</P>

      <P>My Departments' website was launched in May 1996 and can be accessed at www.welfare.ie. The focus of the site is to provide up to date information directly to the public and in particular to groups and agencies, which provide information services to citizens. The information on the website includes details of schemes, entitlements, rates and methods of payment, application forms, publications and locations for contacting the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site also provides some on-line services. Customers can now notify the Department on-line of loss of employment, request an application <Col N="1326" /> form for child benefit, e-mail our information section or comment on the service provided through the website or at our network of local service offices. This is an area we intend developing. It is the intention to maximise the use of the Internet in the delivery of a quality service to our customers.</P>
    <P>The total number of hits on the site in 2001 was 3,179,089. This accounts for 376,456 user sessions or an average of 1,030 sessions per day. There is the equivalent to three full-time staff assigned to the maintenance and development of the website. The cost of maintaining the site in 2001 was of the order of £107,000, 135,86.97. This cost includes hardware, software and staff costs.</P>

      <P>Section 19(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, shall, upon being directed by me to do so, prepare a code of standards to be complied with and rules and practices to be observed in respect of advertising matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children on any broadcasting service or sound broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Act, 2001, came into effect on 1 September last. Arrangements are being finalised at present to provide the BCI with the necessary resources, including staffing, to allow it undertake its new and expanded role. It is my intention to issue a direction to the BCI under Section 19(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, as soon as I am satisfied that the BCI has the necessary resources in place to deal with this important piece of work.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance has, on my initiative, allocated an additional 3 million in this year's budget for cultural projects. I expect to decide in the near future how this additional funding is to be allocated. I have already placed on record my acknowledgement of the merits of the Tinteán project.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. My role is to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. This is reinforced in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. A planning authority must have regard, under the Act, to any recommendation made by me. However, a decision may be made not to comply with a recommendation, provided that an expla<Col N="1328" /> nation is made outlining the reasons why inclusion in the record of protected structures is considered inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</P>
    <P>As surveys are published I will be recommending to planning authorities that structures rated as being of regional, national or international importance be included in the record of protected structures. To date, the interim county survey of Clare and the town surveys of Ballina, Castlebar, Carrick-on-Shannon, Ennis, Clonmel, Galway, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Longford, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Wicklow, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Roscrea and Sligo have been published. I have, accordingly, recommended that 2,155 buildings in total be included in the record of protected structures of the relevant planning authority.</P>
    <P>The decision to include buildings in the record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives in each planning authority. If they do not propose accepting my recommendation in any individual case they are required to advise me of the reasons for their decision.</P>
    <P>In respect of Castlebar UDC, Leitrim County Council, Ennis UDC, Tipperary NR County Council, Galway Corporation, Kilkenny Corporation, Letterkenny UDC, Longford UDC, Laois County Council, Tullamore UDC, Wicklow UDC, Cavan UDC, Monaghan UDC, Roscommon County Council, Clonmel Corporation and Sligo Corporation I understand that the statutory process to include my recommendations in the record of protected structures has been initiated but not yet finalised.</P>
    <P>To date, I have been notified of refusals by Ballina UDC, in respect of three structures, Sligo Corporation in respect of two structures and Laois County Council, Portlaoise, in respect of one structure.</P>

    <P>Some 1.51 million is provided as NDP funding for cultural projects, C2. This will be used to enhance facilities at the following national cultural institutions; The National Library of Ireland, The National Museum of Ireland, The National Concert Hall, The Irish Architectural Archive and Wicklow Gaol.</P>
    <P>Some 7 million of NDP funds has been provided for 2002 for projects under the Arts and Cultural Capital Enhancement Support Scheme, ACCESS, for cultural development, C3, which is to operate over the period 2001-04. The list of projects being funded is as follows &ndash; the specific draw down for each project will depend on its progress during the forthcoming year &ndash; Letterkenny Arts Centre, Greencastle Museum, The Courthouse Arts Centre, Leitrim, Dundalk Townhall Theatre and Basement Gallery, Sligo County Museum, Visual Arts Centre, Carlow, Music Centre Ennis, Ennistymon Artists Studios, The Mall Arts Centre, Cork, Martin Valley Sculpture Park, Cork, Liberty Corner Arts and Dance Centre, Dublin, Gate Theatre, Dublin, Ballyfermot Arts Centre, Daghda Dance Company, Limerick, Navan Arts Centre, Thurles Arts Centre, Lismore Heritage, Waterford, Wexford County Museum, Gorey Little Theatre and Bray Arts Centre.</P>
    <P>Under Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin, an allocation of 6.98 million of NDP funds has been provided for 2002 for the improvement of strategic roads and village renewal in the Gaeltacht. A list of projects being funded will not be available until a programme of works is agreed with the relevant local authorities in the new year but they will include improvement to non-national roads and village renewal in Galway, Donegal, Mayo, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Meath. An allocation of 508,000 has also been provided for the improvement and development works at Baile Fuar Uisce which includes remedial work on the existing pier, construction of new storm wall and removal of rock and silt.</P>
    <P>The allocations under subheads H2 and H3, some 32.2 million, will fund Údarás na Gaeltachta's development work under the national development plan, in particular under the following measures; finance for industry, land and buildings and human resources.</P>
    <P>The many specific projects under these <Col N="1330" /> measures are approved on a case by case basis and are implemented over a period of years.

Productions will be allocated funding as applications are received during 2002, so it is not possible to list the projects at this stage. Funding under the NDP will also provide support for film training needs in association with Screen Training Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead S, National Parks and Wildlife, 9.183 million is provided for in 2002. The principal projects planned for 2002 include the restoration and reopening of Doneraile Court, County Cork, the acquisition of a site for a visitor-study centre at Clara Bog, County Offaly, and the construction of a visitor centre for the Mayo National Park at Ballycroy.

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership and I am not, therefore, in a position to provide assistance for the restoration and renovation of St. Joseph's School, Kilcock, County Kildare. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority, Kildare County Council in this instance.</P>
      <P>The owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in the incidence of any form of crime is, of course, a cause for concern, and particularly so with respect to sex-related crimes. The Deputy will be aware that earlier this year I launched a research report entitled Attrition in Sexual Assault Cases in Ireland: A Qualitative Analysis, which describes victims' interaction with various parts of the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>The resulting recommendations have implications not only for a number of areas of that system but also relate to wider social, health, education and media issues. I have referred the report and its recommendations to the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> As the Deputy may be aware, the national steering committee, on which the network of rape crisis centres and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre are both represented, is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the responsibility for providing a multi-agency, cohesive response to victims of violence. The national steering committee is developing an information and awareness campaign targeted specifically at victims of rape and sexual assault. </P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and, in particular, the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit liaise with rape crisis centres throughout the country and encourage early reporting by victims who contact the centres. In addition, the Garda Síochána research unit at the Garda Training College, Templemore, has had a number of workshops with the rape crisis centres and other NGOs on reconciling the statistics on sexual offences produced by the various agencies involved so as to more accurately assess the levels of reported sexual crime. The national crime council plans to commission a major research study on domestic violence which may examine the issue of sexual violence within a domestic situation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, provides for separate legal representation for victims of rape and other serious sexual offences in particular circumstances. The Act also provides for a new notification procedure for all convicted sex offenders. The system, known as a tracking system, allows for the gardaí to be aware at all times of the current names and addresses of convicted sex offenders who, within seven days of their conviction or following their release from prison where appropriate, will have to notify their names and addresses to the gardaí. Any subsequent changes to their names and addresses will have to be similarly notified again within seven days of the event, including details of any trips abroad lasting seven days or more. The notification requirement will also extend to all persons entering this country, and not just Irish citizens, who have been convicted of a sex offence in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In 2001 funding from the Department of Health and Children for victim services and facilities has increased and this will, I have no doubt, benefit the range and level of services in all regions. I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to keep the position under review.</P>

It would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time to compile this information.</P>
      <P>The overall number of prosecutions for driving licence offences, including the offences referred to by the Deputy, are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

    <P>The child care measure has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, and is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
    <P>The equality for women measure forms part of the Government's commitment to promoting gender equality. It provides funding to projects to upskill and retrain women employees, to encourage entrepreneurship and career development among women, to support innovative projects for disadvantaged women and women over 50 years of age and to support gender balance in decision making.</P>
    <P>In addition, the measure is funding an initiative to gender proof personnel practices. This work is being undertaken by the Equality Authority on behalf of my Department. The Authority is delivering this strand through equality reviews and action plans involving the identification of multiple discriminations within the gender experience. The measure is also funding the work of the national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise which has been set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The NDP gender equality unit has been established to promote equal opportunities between women and men, in particular, through a gender mainstreaming approach. In 2002 the unit will continue to develop its work programme in accordance with its programme complement under the employment and human resources development operational programme by engaging in the further development of the training programme; conducting further research into <Col N="1337" /> gender equality issues in the areas of agriculture; statistics evaluation methodologies and tourism; resourcing the community and voluntary pillar to support gender mainstreaming; and a communications programme to publicise and support the unit's work in promoting equal opportunities between women and men across the NDP.</P>
    <P>CONNECT 2000-2006 is an action-research project which is run by the Irish Prison Service of my Department in collaboration with the National Training Development Institute of the REHAB Group. The project focuses on prisoners' transition from custody, through training, to reintegration in the community, and labour market participation. Research was carried out, and based on this research, pilot strategies and systems were developed and implemented to fill gaps in current vocational and employment programmes for prisoners. The project will now be rolled out to every prison in the State.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service is targeting a number of groups such as those under 25 years who have been before the courts and are likely to reoffend and become long-term unemployed. Another target group will be women, particularly young women with drug problems and those with families whose lives are disrupted, for example by domestic violence. A number of drug treatment facilities are planned under this sub-measure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Garda youth diversion projects, these are aimed at young people, aged ten to 18 years, in urban and rural areas who are at risk of becoming further involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour. A diversionary outcome is brought about by the provision of suitable activities to facilitate personal development, encourage civic responsibility and enhance the long-term employability prospects of the participants. Finally, local drugs task force projects aim, through engaging with young people and adults and involving them in constructive activities, to divert them from becoming involved in drug abuse.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this Government has identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006. In total, IR£344 million, 436.79 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of this funding are to increase the availability and quality of child care places. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
      <P>Capital grants are available to not for profit-community groups and private child care providers. Staffing grants are available to not for profit-community groups who demonstrate that their service has a focus on tackling disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The fees charged are not a factor in relation to the consideration of grants allocated to private child care providers under the equal opportunities child care programme. Fees in respect of child care provision are not regulated. I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care unit that no application for funding under the equal opportunities child care programme of my Department has been received from any service at the address provided by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the central transfer lists for provincial locations which are maintained by my Department in respect of general Civil Service grades represented by the Civil and Public Service Union. I propose to provide the details sought by the Deputy in two separate tables. Table A shows details of the number of persons interested in transferring to Garda Síochána offices and Probation and Welfare Service offices around the country as well as the Waterford office of the Land Registry and the finance division in Killarney. Table B provides details of those officers in my Department who have applied for a transfer to the Courts Service only.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to transfers to provincial areas for staff officers and clerical officers is that they are arranged in accordance with the standardised transfer system which has been agreed with the Civil and Public Service Union and which applies to all Departments. The central transfer agreement provides that applications for transfer are recorded in order of the date of receipt of each application. When vacancies arise they must then be offered in this order. No formal transfer agreement with the relevant unions exists for staff at executive officer level or above.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that following a recent agreement reached between the Department of Finance and the Civil and Public Service Union regarding certain revisions to the operation of the central transfer scheme, each Department-office has been requested to update its lists of applicants to provincial locations. This involves all staff who are on the central transfer scheme renewing their applications for transfer if they wish to remain on the lists. The task of updating my Department's lists has recently commenced. However, given the significant volume of applications received to date I understand that it will be some weeks yet before these lists are fully updated.</P>

While this is a difficult task, in view of the large number of stations involved and the fact that some of them were built before the foundation of the State, every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to ensure a high standard of Garda premises throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In that context, I can assure the Deputy that all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure that it meets the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the crime figures compiled by the Garda Síochána show a 22.9% decline in indictable crime between 1996 and 2000. This is a clear vindication of the policies pursued by me since taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;, &ndash; that is implementation of the law of the land &ndash; approach to crime: first, a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime. second, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime; and third, a <Col N="1344" /> commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that never in the history of the State has the Garda Síochána been better resourced or equipped. Garda strength is heading towards 12,000 which will be an all time high.</P>
    <P>When I came into office in 1997, I was facing a situation where almost one in five prisoners were on temporary release. Literally hundreds of prisoners were being released each week because of lack of prison places, to relieve chronic overcrowding, and to maintain order in the prisons. As a direct consequence of my prison building programme, the number on temporary release has plummeted to 5.8% of the prison population currently. I am satisfied that the contribution which this has made to reducing indictable crime statistics is clear and irrefutable.</P>
    <P>My policy for dealing with drugs and organised crime is well known: it is one of strong legislation backed up by tough enforcement to tackle drug dealing and trafficking. This policy has resulted in record drug seizures by An Garda Síochána, with many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and major drug barons fleeing abroad with a high percentage of persons who are prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think, however, that I have just focused on the enforcement side of dealing with the crime problem. I am particularly pleased to have placed increased emphasis on measures to reduce youth crime and my Department has invested significantly in preventive measures such as the Garda youth diversion projects. There were just 12 in existence when I took up office in 1997: there are now 64 and funding has been secured for them under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that provision is made in the Garda Vote each year for the purchase or delivery of vehicles for the Garda fleet and the maintenance of existing vehicles. This year alone, more than £6 million or 7.6 million will be spent on the purchase of new vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I took office there has been significant investment in the Garda fleet which has expanded in size to a current total of approximately 2,000 operational vehicles. The need to allocate additional vehicles or reallocate vehicles is constantly assessed by the Garda authorities on an ongoing basis. Factors such as population, <Col N="1345" /> crime and area are taken into consideration in the process of assessing vehicle allocation or the need for extra transport.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities objective is to replace each car when it has reached 100,000 miles. The average age of the Garda fleet is a little over two years. While there are cars in excess of this average age in the fleet, the older models are not used as patrol cars. They are utilised on special enquiries such as drugs investigations, missing persons investigations, murder investigations etc.</P>
    <P>The Garda fleet is also being constantly upgraded in order to ensure that the most modern facilities are available to members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>Garda cars are subject to the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations and are also regularly serviced and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers instructions.</P>
    <P>A Garda transport advisory group has been set up to review the optimum size and structure of the Garda fleet and overall fleet replacement policy. This group includes representatives from the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Finance. Any recommendations made by the group will receive careful and detailed consideration.</P>

      <P>The Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, provides grants to organisations for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. Among the objectives of the programme are to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport; and to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.</P>

The objective of the fund is to attract at-risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund are ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and-or drugs etc.</P>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of over £26 million or 33 million has been allocated to date for the provision of youth orientated facilities. The type of projects and initiatives approved as part of the plans and strategies submitted to date include: capital projects such as community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in an area &ndash; access for the target group is an essential condition of funding for capital projects; and a number of purpose-built youth centres which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown where there is a dearth of dedicated youth facilities.</P>

      <P>Following on the completion of a feasibility study, &ldquo;A Stadium for the New Century&rdquo;, carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and acting on the advice of a steering committee which oversaw the study, the Government decided to proceed with the Sports Campus Ireland project, motivated by a desire to provide <Col N="1350" /> a campus of sporting excellence which would cater for the sporting needs of both the elite athlete and the more modest performer in a variety of the main sporting activities enjoyed by Irish people.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the independent overview of the cost of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project, completed this year, did not require the consultants to comment on the possible use of Sports Campus Ireland as a home venue for a soccer team in a new European League as no such proposal has ever been put forward for consideration.</P>
      <P>The cost overview has now been completed and the final report has been presented to the steering group of senior officials appointed by Government to oversee the work and formally accepted by them on 14 November 2001. I have received the final report from the steering group with their advice and I intend submitting it to Government for its consideration. I have already indicated to the House that, until the report has been considered by Government, I do not intend to make any statement on its contents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware of the major new programme, Giving Children an Even Break by Tackling Disadvantage, which I launched in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will be run over a three year period and will cost £26 million. It involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March/April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through to second class, and a ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, that is third class through to sixth class.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and has received supplementary grant aid of £4,543 in respect of the 2000-2001 school year. It is eligible to receive £4,842 in respect of the 2001-2002 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the ERC survey outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. They are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. To date it appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by a local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to me or my Department to <Col N="1360" /> depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until the relevant local authority or VEC has made a decision on an application all inquiries regarding it should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution. It provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities. They are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>With regard to the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants, my Department has forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities with a request that payment be made with effect from the 2000-2001 academic year. Arrangements for payment of the special rates are a matter for the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Mayo County Council has advised my Department that payment of the special rate of maintenance grant, in respect of the 2000-2001 academic year, was issued to 91 students on 4 December. Applications in respect of the 2001-2002 academic year are still being processed. The county council anticipates that payments to eligible students will be made by the end of January 2002.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the expert advisory group on certificate examinations was that the time element of examinations should be made less critical in the future in order to better accommodate candidates who have a difficulty with time. In response to this recommendation an extension of time has been made available to all candidates in a number of the more time critical papers in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>In the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject. At the same time every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with the marking scheme for the work done.</P>
      <P>My Department instructs all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to ensure that the candidate is given credit for all work done.</P>

Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through to second class, and a ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, that is third class through to sixth class.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school has received supplementary grant aid of £1,860 in respect of the 2000-2001 school year and it is eligible to receive £1,733 in respect of the 2001-2002 school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the £7,020 for 2000-2001 and £6,540 for 2001-2002 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the ERC survey outcome.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the ERC for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools. My Department has now received a report from the ERC. The position of those schools that made representations is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>There is no record of representations having been received from the school until recently and, accordingly, the position of the school was not considered. The circumstances of the school may fall to be considered again in the context of any future modifications to the programme.</P>

      <P>Every year my Department receives more than 1.5 million scripts, practical pieces and other test products for examination. It is not logistically feasible to facilitate the return of this quantity of examination material to candidates. In the interests of fairness and equity it is not possible to return a metalwork project to a particular candidate while retaining material from other candidates who took part in metalwork, art, engineering and other examinations.</P>
      <P>The optimum solution to the issues raised by the Deputy lies in realigning the assessment arrangements in subjects such as metalwork that generate artefacts. At present the practical pieces in a number of subjects are examined in schools and consequently there are no logistical difficulties involved in returning the material. There are short-term storage issues for the schools which makes it difficult to expand the number of subjects where the schools retain the material to include subjects like metalwork.</P>
      <P>I have requested my officials to review the arrangements in consultation with the relevant interests, including school management bodies, in order to progress these issues on a consensus basis.</P>

This pilot project, including the range of programmes offered, will be the subject of a comprehensive evaluation and the initiative will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained at the end of the five year period. The level of funding for the centre for the remaining years will be a matter for consideration by my Department in consultation with the Higher Education Authority.

      <P>At the time of its establishment in 1999, the development plan for the national educational psychological service envisaged its achieving nationwide coverage by the end of 2004. However, in July this year the Government approved my proposals to accelerate the development of NEPS with a view to its achieving full nationwide coverage by the end of 2002. NEPS is being expanded in line with the agreed target. As part of this process, the Civil Service and local government commissioners are organising a competition to recruit more psychologists to the service. The needs of the area mentioned by the Deputy will be given a high priority in the assignment of additional psychologists.</P>
      <P>Also earlier this year, the Government approved an allocation of £1.25 million to facilitate the funding of private assessments in areas where urgent assessment is needed and where NEPS is unable to provide the necessary service within a reasonable timeframe. Details of this scheme were issued to all schools in August 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the child mentioned by the Deputy, my Department's inspectorate will be in contact with the child's family very shortly to discuss how the child's needs can best be addressed <Col N="1370" /> in a school setting. In the event of any further educational psychological assessment report being required as a result of these discussions, arrangements will be made to fund such assessment under the scheme referred to above.

      <P>At primary level, with the exception of the north Kildare national school project, enrolments in Celbridge have been in gradual decline in recent years. However, there are three projects in architectural planning for primary schools in the Celbridge area. My Department has received a tender report in relation to the north Kildare national school project and this is currently being examined. The other two projects are at advanced stages of architectural planning. They involve the replacement of temporary classrooms with permanent accommodation and improving the level of ancillary accommodation at Scoil Mochua and Scoil na Mainistreach. It is envisaged that, following the completion of these building projects, there will be sufficient primary school accommodation to meet current and anticipated demand.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, a new school building was provided for St. Wolstan's Community School in 1999. In addition, an application for additional accommodation has been received from the Salesian College. In that regard, the planning and building unit of my Department is awaiting additional information on housing developments from the local authority in order to progress the application further.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor school accommodation requirements in the Celbridge area and any additional needs will be addressed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>At primary level the position is that, in Naas, a new 16 teacher school is currently in architectural planning. The original brief for this project is being reviewed in light of additional housing developments in the area and consequential increased demand for primary school places. At post-primary level, the position is that, following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. The current status of these building projects is that the extension and refurbishment programme at St. Mary's college has been completed, while the building programme for Meánscoil Iognáid Rís is in architectural planning. The need to extend and refurbish St. Patrick's post-primary school has been agreed in principle with the school's management authority, County Kildare Vocational Education Committee. Further information is awaited from the VEC before this project can be progressed. The overall school accommodation requirements in Naas will be kept under regular review in the planning and building unit of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes. The schemes are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the <Col N="1375" /> relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in the provision of pre-school services currently involves support for the early start pre-school pilot programme; the Rutland Street pre-school project; pre-schools for Traveller children and recent pre-school provision for children with autism. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to these programmes is on the following table.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional pre-school places for 2002 and future years will be considered by my Department in the context of the implementation of the White Paper on early childhood education &ndash; Ready to Learn &ndash; which sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector, with the aim of building on existing provision and assisting providers to raise the quality of provision. In this regard, I recently appointed St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the Dublin Institute of Technology to jointly undertake and manage a project to develop and support the provision of quality early childhood education in pursuance of these objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project, which will run for up to three years, will involve the establishment of a centre for early childhood development and education which will be jointly managed by the two colleges and will be staffed by a full-time director and project team with relevant professional expertise in the area of early childhood education. Funding for the project will be met from the £74 million allocation provided by the Government under the <Col N="1377" /> national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious difficulties posed to Our Lady of Victories infant school, Dublin 9, due to the withdrawal of two classroom assistants who were on community employment; the help which is available to this school to compensate for the loss of these positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end.</P>
      <P>The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant has been increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>In line with the new arrangements, Our Lady of Victories infant school recently received a further payment of £2,190 &ndash; 2,780.73 &ndash; towards the cost of ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004, depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Schools which used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from Special Education Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
