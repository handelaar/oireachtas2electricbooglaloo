      <P>The thrust of these amendments is an objection to the principle behind the Bill, namely, to take powers which elected representatives of local authorities have to make and implement a waste management plan and give it to managers, who are unelected and unaccountable. It is an undemocratic provision, as we stated on Committee Stage, on which there was much discussion. Power is being taken from the representatives of the people and given to faceless individuals who are under no obligation to consult local people. There has been widespread protest against plans which include thermal treatment plants or incinerators. It is widely acknowledged that these are the main stumbling blocks to the implementation of the plans. Most plans contain great aspirations in regard to recycling, but there is very little provision of infrastructure to facilitate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that if the members of a local authority have not agreed a waste management plan, the county manager can get a consultant to draw one up with no input from the members. They will not be in a position to rubber stamp the plan; it will be implemented without <Col N="1015" /> consultation. Seanad amendments go a step further &ndash; with the proposal that if a waste facility contravenes a development plan then the county manager can override that too.</P>
    <P>There has been difficulty in adopting waste management plans throughout the country. There are objections because people are genuinely concerned about the provision of an incinerator in their area. We have to acknowledge and address those concerns. There is no point telling people that this is the plan for how waste will be dealt with in their area &ndash; they need to be consulted and listened to. I acknowledge that this process is widely used in Europe, but their fears may be warranted &ndash; there is much documentation on the negative impact of incineration. Is it really necessary to have six incinerators across the country as is currently proposed? No economic assessment of the implication of providing this number of incinerators has been made. Where will that leave us when we want to reduce waste and encourage recycling if we have six incinerators that have to be fed waste? This is a case of putting the cart before the horse. It is not addressing the concerns of people regarding the recycling of waste.</P>
    <P>There is even more concern out there with the proposed removal of power in this area from the locally elected representatives. Last week we had the local government Bill which was championed as being a reform of local government &ndash; and there has been criticism of that Bill also &ndash; yet this week we have a Bill being rushed through the Dáil, guillotined on Second Stage and rushed through Committee Stage to accommodate the implementation of waste management plans that the majority of people are not happy with. The people have not been consulted and their concerns have not been addressed in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to section 4 of this Bill which proposes to override the elected representatives. This is anti-democratic and is making a mockery of local government &ndash; it is a blunt measure which attempts to railroad through a proposal which the people do not support. This is a bad day for local government and for the people who have elected their representatives. It will do nothing to encourage the public to have confidence in their public representatives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister even at this late stage to recognise the error of what he is proposing here today, to step back from it and listen to the concerns of the people and address them. There are many positive aspects in the development plans but to railroad it through in this manner is an insult to the people and their public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in particular section 4, is the most undemocratic measure to have been brought before this House by any Government &ndash; certainly in my time here. We are taking about 20 amendments together which deal with the excising of powers.</P>
      <P>The waste management plan, which is currently the responsibility of the democratically elected local representatives, will be removed from them and given to county managers. If any local authority decides to attach a condition in its waste management plan to the draft plan it is presented by the consultants, then this Bill allows the county manager to strike down the plan and change it to his own will.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes that the normal functions of elected members of a local authority to give specific directions to their county manager will be set aside on any matter relating to waste. If, for example, the consultants' report on a waste management plan sets a target of 35% recycling of household waste and the county council wants a more ambitious target, such as 50%, then the county manager can strike that down and make his own plan. Similarly, if a county council wants to establish a recycling plant, or take action on the litter problem associated with bottle banks, it would normally give instruction to the county manager, but, under paragraph (g) of this Bill, it will no longer be possible for it to do so. However, it gets worse because what this Bill is proposing is that the waste management plan that is made by the county manager &ndash; rather than the county council &ndash; will automatically become part of the county development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us contrast that with the approach taken on social housing. When we debated the Planning and Development Bill last year to try to provide some additional land to local authorities for social housing, the Government told us that based on advice on constitutionality, it was not possible to include a provision in the Bill to provide land for social housing without going through the step by step process of the county development plan. Yet in this Bill, it is cutting right through the county development plan. If the county manager decides <Col N="1017" /> he wants a particular waste management plan, <i>ipso facto</i>, under section 10(<i>a</i>), that waste management plan becomes part of the county development plan without any public consultation and without any decision by the elected representatives of the people. It just appears.</P>
    <P>We know what these waste management plans are about &ndash; they are about building incinerators and that is why the Government has constructed this so-called regional approach to waste management. The regions are constructed around the assumption that there will be an incinerator in each region and that is why they were established as regions and why there is an insistence on regional waste management plans.</P>
    <P>The plan is that some of these incinerators will be built by private companies. If it is proposed to build an incinerator in an agricultural area, a planning application would normally be required to be made. Under this Bill, the normal planning processes are being stood down to facilitate the building of the incinerator or any other waste management facility. Let us say the incinerator is being located in an agricultural area and the land on which it is proposed to be built is zoned as agricultural, the normal procedure that would apply in a situation such as that is that it would be advertised in the normal way, either as a variation of the development plan or a material contravention of the development plan, there would be public consultation and the decision to advertise in the first place would be one made the elected members of the council. The decision as to whether to vary the development plan or to give the material contravention of the development plan would be one for the elected members of the county council. Under this Bill, that will change.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, when the company building the incinerator puts in its planning application, it is not the elected members who will decide whether it is in contravention of the development plan, it is the county manager &ndash; the same county manager who has put this incinerator into his waste management plan in the first place and perhaps in spite of the opposition or concerns of the elected members of the council. The county manager will decide whether to advertise. It then goes out to public consultation and, according to this, any submissions, observations, etc., received within four weeks shall be considered by the manager. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) states: &ldquo;Following consideration of any submissions or observations received in accordance with paragraph (<i>b</i>), the manager of the planning authority may&rdquo; make the decision. The section also states &ldquo;the manager may &ndash; (<i>a</i>) notwithstanding the fact the proposed development would materially contravene the development plan, decide to proceed with the proposed development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have a closed circle here. It starts with making the waste management plan, which the <Col N="1018" /> county manager makes. The county manager then decides whether it is in contravention of the development plan and receives the submissions from the public. At the end of the loop, the county manager decides whether to grant permission. This is suppressing local democracy. The people elect representatives at local level to represent their views and they expect them to be enabled to govern for them at local level. What is being done in this Bill is that the rights of the people to elect representatives in the expectation that those representatives will vindicate their wishes on their local authorities are being suppressed. On top of that, the normal planning process that has been in place for almost 40 years is being stood down to fast track and facilitate the building of incinerators or other waste management facilities.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that what the Government is doing in this Bill is, at one level, a denial of local democracy and local government and, at another level, it is an attempt to push through an agenda to build incinerators to deal with a waste problem which it has neglected for the past four years. More seriously than that, it is removing from our system of local government, the local democratic institutions through which people expect to be able to vindicate their democratic rights. I warned on Committee Stage, and I do so again, that if the Government persists in doing this, it will create circumstances where there will be conflict between local communities, local authorities and agencies of Government. If people are denied the opportunity, right and facility to express their point of view and concerns through democratic institutions they will, as history has told us time and time again, return to the streets and protest to vindicate those rights. This is a recipe for conflict and demonstrations on our streets. This is profoundly undemocratic and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>What is being done in this Bill is far more damaging to democracy than, for example, the prohibition on opinion polls in the last week of an election. There is no one in the Press Gallery. I have spent weeks dealing with this Bill, as have other Members of this House, and addressing the danger in it. It is one of a number of Bills with which I have dealt in recent weeks and which many of us have spent hours, days and weeks addressing. We have dealt with hundreds of amendments to this Bill, the local government Bill, the electoral Bill and the motor taxation Bill. We dealt with motions on the planning tribunal and on An Bord Pleanála. Last year we dealt with the Planning and Development Bill, another local government Bill and a Bill on housing. I reckon I have participated in the debate on about 2,000 amendments to various Bills from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the past 15 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> It is not for me to answer this question but I would like to raise it. Why of all those 2,000 amendments the only issue in which the press has expressed any interest is the issue that affects it? Why, for example, have issues such as the rights of communities which are deeply concerned about the effects of dioxins from incineration, the rights of citizens who are concerned about the implications of pollutants from landfills &ndash; today's EPA report gives them no great cause for joy &ndash; the rights of people to vindicate their position through democratically elected institutions, the problems and plight of the 60,000 families on housing waiting lists, the 150,000 families in private rented tenancies and the rights of people who want to make an objection to a planning application and who, under the Planning and Development Act, will be charged, did not warrant an editorial or even a report on the proceedings of this House? It is an issue which the press needs to examine. It is difficult not to conclude, in so far as the reporting of the proceedings of this House is concerned, that the press appears to be more interested in vindicating the commercial interests of its owners than in reporting the proceedings of this House and the matters of concern to communities and the people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is fundamentally opposed to what the Government is trying to do in this Bill. We are opposed to section 4 and our amendments are designed to excise the measures the Government seeks to introduce which are designed to deny people their fundamental democratic rights at local level and to fast track an incineration agenda to deal with a waste problem which we believe should be dealt with by other means. The Labour Party published a document on this issue earlier this year in which we pointed to alternative strategies based on recycling to address the waste problem. If we were to invest in recycling facilities and infrastructure, we would be far better able to deal with the waste problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments we are discussing highlight how badly organised is the Government on the waste issue. The Bill proposes a recipe for conflict, demonstrations and lack of resolution of the waste crisis as the Government's proposal will result in court and constitutional challenges. The Government appears to be hell bent on causing conflict. The Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, hardens the policy put in place in the 1996 Waste Management Act which focused on a regional approach designed to hide waste in an &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; strategy. The Government hoped to find areas in which people would not mind taking on the burden of other people's waste. Such places do not exist and that fairy tale must be exposed. Nobody is going to accept other people's waste being dumped in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> The Government must go back to the drawing board and re-examine its regional plans. If, after that, it is still hell bent on proceeding with regional plans, it must allow them to augment local plans. The Government has effectively outlawed local plans and the regional plan has become the only show in town. That must change because local plans will bring about local consultation, responsibility, accountability and, ultimately, action. That is the only way we can hope to reduce waste which is the issue on which we should focus if we are to comply with European legislation. The bulk of resources should be going towards the reduction of waste but the exact opposite is the case in the Government's policy. Waste reduction receives least, if any, meaningful resources and incineration and landfill at the bottom of the hierarchy receive most under the national development plan and all other Government allocations in this area.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to back-up the warning signs to which I and others have pointed. A 1998 article on the effects on communities near landfill sites in the reputable medical journal, <i>The Lancet</i>, makes very disturbing reading. If the Government is at all serious about the welfare of the people, it should note and act on such medical findings and advice. We should also be cognisant, as the EPA report published yesterday points out, that we are not in any position to effectively monitor the type and scale of the facilities with which this Government wishes to press ahead, be they landfill or incineration.</P>
    <P>Today's editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> points to the fact that local authorities do not have the necessary expertise or resources to monitor the problems which the EPA indicates have been created and will continue to be created in an out of sight, out of mind manner. The EPA took five years to compile the plan published yesterday although it was supposed to have been published immediately after the 1996 Act. The Act provides that the plan on hazardous waste should be reviewed every five years so the next plan should commence preparation now. There is a huge lack of resources, will and effective monitoring. The director of the EPA pointed to the need for a prevention ethos but there is very little prevention ethos in the Bill. The Bill represents a bulldozer approach; go ahead and to hell with the consequences. Section 4 provides that county managers are the people ultimately charged with decision making in regard to future waste strategy.</P>
    <P>We seem to have learned very little from international experience in the area of thermal treatment. Thermal treatment plants are closing down in the US, Japan, France &ndash; where no more are to be built &ndash; Belgium, Holland, Italy, Germany and Portugal, yet Ireland and Spain plan to build such plants. The idea that by building incinerators we are only following the pack does not stand up <Col N="1021" /> to international comparison and the most modern awareness on this issue. Ludwig Kramer, head of the EU environmental waste management unit, is also quite sceptical about incineration. We are merely serving the interests of people who are desperately seeking sites on which to build redundant incinerators and we will leave behind a very damaging legacy for this and future generations. This is not a waste management Bill because it is not based on hierarchy. Instead, it is a waste hiding Bill which adopts an upside down approach to waste management.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments relate to section 4 which is where the waste strategy is being altered to confer total responsibility on county managers. The reference to incineration as &ldquo;waste to energy&rdquo; is an untruth because energy is wasted when one burns valuable raw materials. A County Meath company which recycles 3.5 million plastic bottles every day has highlighted scientifically that for every tonne of plastic burnt, a tonne of natural gas is wasted which could be saved if the material were recycled. This is the type of scientific information we must consider rather than giving away powers to county managers who will probably be challenged in court. We will end up going around in circles and the crisis will deteriorate further.</P>
      <P>Fund raising events, one of which will be held tonight, are currently being held in my constituency. People are prepared to fight this every inch of the way and the fight will end up in the courts. I urge the Minister to bear this is mind and to take note of what is happening in Germany where a date has been stipulated after which there will be no landfill. Australia and New Zealand have fought and tried hard to implement their goal of a zero waste strategy and have had some success over a period of time. Their goal is not to overturn democracy and hand dictatorial powers to county managers to give big business and multinationals a lion's share of the money in building incinerators and landfills. That is not their goal. Their goal is zero waste and that should be ours too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill more strongly than I have ever opposed anything in the 20 years I have been a Member of the House. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. I genuinely believe the Government is on the wrong track on this one. This is the most draconian legislation ever to come before this House. It will send a signal down the road that, if a Government is hell bent on doing things such as this, this is not the last of this type of legislation that will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spent the past four years supposedly enhancing the role of local <Col N="1022" /> councillors and democracy. Every time I turned on the television or listened to him speak in this House his mantra was that we must enhance local democracy. When things were not going too well in the waste management area, he and his colleagues in Government, ably assisted by the Progressive Democrats and the four Independents, decided, as Deputy Gilmore rightly pointed out, to ensure that the county manager is the supremo and that he or she can do what he or she likes. This is the last type of authority the county manager in County Galway, with whom I am most familiar, wants. I am sure county managers do not want this visited on them.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4, what we are really talking about &ndash; it started the day M.C. O'Sullivan, the consultants, placed a document with a number of proposals before Galway County Council nearly three years ago &ndash; is an incinerator proposed for Galway city and two landfills, one in County Galway and one in north Connacht. They are the leading proposals in the report. The minimisation about which Deputy Sargent spoke, reuse and recycling are also in the report, but the priority given to those are well down the road. Everybody knows as well as I do that if private enterprise builds an incinerator &ndash; this is nothing to do with health &ndash; at the colossal cost I heard mentioned, mark my words it will have to get the raw material to keep it going. It is like a monster with an over-stretched stomach. It has to be fed every hour of every day of every year. Once such an incinerator becomes operational, we might as well forget about reuse and recycling. We will have to put the raw material in over a 25 year period as I understand that is the only way to recoup the cost of the capital investment involved.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, the system that will be introduced will ensure there will be very little reuse or recycling of waste. I assume the Minister will counter that by asking what did we do or what are we doing about it, but I will argue that point with anybody. I and 29 colleagues from every political party, walk of life and from every parish from Clifden down to Glenamaddy saw fit on two occasions to unanimously decide that we did not want this because we knew the people of Galway did not want it. This was done very cleverly because this is a regional plan that the other counties of Connacht would have to go for given that they nono of them had an incinerator nor a landfill.</P>
    <P>I have a few specific questions for the Minister of State and I hope he will answer them. Given that county managers will be given this power, as I assume they will as most likely there will be no change to this section, some backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies must feel very uneasy about that. Following the actions of the four Independents this week and, I assume, again today, there will not be that many communities around the coun<Col N="1023" /> try who will say they will be best served by an Independent when they realise what they have done on this issue. This will not be a flag raising exercise for Independents. I have only used the name of M.C. O'Sullivan consultants because they are the author of this document. If Galway's county manager is given this power, must he act to the letter on everything in that document? In other words, is he at liberty to change it? From my reading of the legislation I understand he is. Will the Minister of State confirm if he can change that document? If he cannot, in order for this to go through, there will have to be a second landfill in north Connacht. It is significant that after three years three small, densely populated communities in east Galway have been haunted in that they have been earmarked for three of those landfill sites. There are thousands of acres of Coillte forests all over County Galway, but M.C. O'Sullivan consultants seem to think there is no point in going near those, despite the fact that when Kerry had a problem five or six years ago, its country manager and officials used a Coillte forest outside Tralee. I am not saying that there would not be objections to that, but at least we would not have to steamroll several people out of their homes and small farms in three places in County Galway.</P>
    <P>There is another vital issue regarding section 4. It is my view and the view of many colleagues on all sides of Galway County Council and Galway Corporation &ndash; although some of them wilted under pressure from Ministers by refusing to give the go ahead with this on one occasion &ndash; that a number of regional plans seem to be going through on the basis of two or three counties that would have no greater a population than Galway city and county whose population numbers almost 180,000. Is it possible for a county manager to interpret that area as a region in the context of this document?</P>
    <P>There is also another major issue. I cannot understand why elected representatives will not be given an opportunity to be involved in this process at any stage. Members of Galway County Council will be only interested bystanders in this process after today. We will not be able to do anything, good or bad, about it. What will the communities we represent across the country &ndash; and I represent County Galway &ndash; do now through the democratic process? They worked through councillors and TDs, day in and day out. Being in front of 500 or 600 people who have a genuine problem was not the most pleasant place to be, but that is what we are paid for. Now there is no point in their coming to me. I cannot do anything for them. Where will they go? Whether they will take to the streets or gather at mass rallies, I guarantee they will not stay at home. If they were against this document for a variety of reasons yesterday, they will surely be against it <Col N="1024" /> tomorrow. Nothing that is happening here today will ensure that people will have a change of mind and say they are for landfill, incineration and what is contained in that document. I know we have a huge problem.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows anything about Galway and the landfill in Ballinasloe will know we are running out of time. I know much more about waste management than I did three years ago and the public is the same, having made a quantum leap in what it is prepared to do to and re-use. There are other ways to deal with this and all the public wants is the leadership and investment needed, which has been provided all over the world. If one starts by building an incinerator, no matter what one does after that, it must be ensured that there is the waste material to keep the thing going year in, year out. That is why this plan is totally flawed.</P>
    <P>There is not one word in the plan about health. I am not in a position to know whether there are huge health problems, though I would not like to live next to an incinerator. However, leaving health out of it, the philosophy behind this programme is wrong. Furthermore, many communities are waiting in the long grass for the next general election. They will think very poorly of public representatives who turned their backs on them and basically said they did not care about people's worries and that they know best.</P>
    <P>In this case, M. C. O'Sullivan knew best for Connacht but now the only one who knows best is the county manager, even though 30 Galway councillors twice rejected this unanimously. One would imagine in any democratic council, with so many diverse views, that one would surely get two or three to agree with it; there are councillors in Galway who would not join each other in the rosary but every single one of them rejected this for a good reason &ndash; they believe it is flawed.</P>
    <P>This is the last day of the term but this is as foul a Bill as we have ever put through the House. I share Deputy Gilmore's lack of understanding of why this is not getting greater coverage. Is it because Galway County Council, or those of Limerick, Waterford or Wexford are affected and that there is a perception that that is caveman stuff? What would they know, the little fellows at the bottom? In the Ireland of 2001 the economic and political power of the vast country outside this city should not be taken for granted. We have reached the stage where we can think for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Communities all over the country are hanging a sword over politicians and they should be listened to. I am the first to accept that nobody wants to live alongside a landfill site or an incinerator but waste disposal can be managed without incineration. I accept there will have to be some landfill site but there are areas of my county which could facilitate a landfill site and which would not cause the trouble we now have in New<Col N="1025" /> bridge, New Inn and Kilrickle. I could not for the life of me understand why, when M. C. O'Sullivan was asked 20 times in our council chamber to look at other sites three years ago, it said that could not be done for a variety of reasons: topography, structure of the soil and so on. I got the idea as the years went by and opposition to landfill sites became strong that if it could have found a landfill site halfway up Croagh Patrick if there was no opposition to it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State explains what the county manager can do about that document or what the legislation entitles him to do. If the manager cannot vary the plan, then people will have to start looking after the landfill site in north Connacht that nobody is bothered about. If it can be changed, the Galway city and county region concept should be taken up. One way or the other, this legislation is draconian in the extreme and if the Independents had any backbone, which obviously they do not, they would vote against it.</P>

      <P>This Bill exposes the naked contempt that the Minister and the Government have for local democracy. I stated on Committee Stage that I believe this Bill is unconstitutional because in 1999 the Government asked the electorate to endorse an amendment which, for the first time, covered local government in the Constitution. That amendment was endorsed with the support of all elected opinion represented in this Chamber. I read Article 28A into the record on both Second and Committee Stages and I do so again now:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiative the interests of such communities.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, makes a mockery of that constitutional amendment. The harsh reality of the Government's attitude to local democracy is contained in the Bill. It is about incineration and waste in some measure but the critical issue at the core of this debate is the Government's naked contempt, as I described it earlier, for local democracy. On the day the Bill was published the Government's commitment to local democracy was exposed as a complete sham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the guillotine applied to each Stage of debate on this Bill. The guillotine was applied last Wednesday when we dealt with Committee Stage and as I said then, that was 4 July. I reminded the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the representatives of the Department who were present, that 4 July was the date on which American citizens celebrated independence. An echo of that history of North America was heard on that day in our discussion and will be heard <Col N="1026" /> repeatedly over the months and years to come if the Bill passes today. The critical cry of those who forged and pursued American independence, one of the core tenets of their republican belief, was &ndash; no taxation without representation. As elected members of local authorities, we have the responsibility to impose charges for refuse, but we have no say whatsoever in their putting in place or the decision-making or how our waste will be managed or dealt with. In effect, we are introducing in this Bill taxation without representation and the people will respond. They will respond with the understanding and acceptance of elected opinion, from all sides of this House, including Members from the two parties represented in government. Local councillors will feel that they have no option but to give support to the anger and frustration that ordinary people will feel in response to this legislation.</P>
    <P>M. C. O'Sullivan has been mentioned before as the firm appointed to look at waste management in the north east. Monaghan County Council engaged it and my office &ndash; working in conjunction with elected colleagues in counties Louth, Meath and Cavan &ndash; presented a number of amendments at the council's debate on the report presented. We were successful in having eight adopted, but parted on the critical area of incineration. Last October in County Louth we saw members of all parties oppose incineration and despite the efforts of the Minister's Government colleagues, who brought pressure to bear on County Louth councillors and sought to overturn their decision last January, including a vote overseen by the chairman of the council on 15 January whose was subsequently deemed to be inaccurate in the High Court, the decision was reaffirmed. It is terrible that members of councils have to use the judicial process in order to establish the factual position and assert their rights and the justice of the decision-making process at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from the neighbouring county, County Meath, and I am sure he looked at the proceedings in County Louth with great interest. It immediately impacted and impinged on the position in his county. I have no doubt that that decision was large in his mind when he, with others in the Cabinet, decided to turn the 1999 constitutional change on its head.</P>
    <P>The message from the Government on this Bill is clear. The people can have democracy, but only if they vote in the way the Government wants them to. My party is committed to ensuring there is a comprehensive system of waste management in place throughout the country. As elected representatives, we take our responsibilities at regional and national level very seriously. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, repeatedly, and falsely, claimed on Committee Stage that the reason the Government had acted as it had was because councils and councillors had either refused or failed to address the issue of waste <Col N="1027" /> management, but nothing could be further from the truth. Councillors were not, and are not, afraid to face this issue or make decisions. The methodology employed in the appointment of the consultants, the brief and the flawed approach they employed &ndash; even to the point of claiming public consultation &ndash; was the most pitiful effort that I have witnessed. It was highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>The waste management plan has been handled abominably by the Government. It is the story of neglect and the absence of long-term planning, for which we are all, in part, responsible. Local councillors have grown to recognise this and are not afraid to deal with it. Waste reduction and reuse are completely neglected in this Bill because there is no political will to confront the main producers of waste &ndash; the manufacturing, construction and large retail sectors. The Government claims to work on the principle that the polluter pays, yet it has introduced a system where the householder and the consumer pay in terms of taxation and local authority refuse charges and in terms of their health where incineration is involved. Make no mistake, we will all be asked to pay a health price for incineration.</P>
    <P>There is no recycling industry and there are no plans in this Bill to foster such an industry. Deputy Clune referred to this on Committee Stage and urged that we look at the whole area of recycling of paper. I fully support her position. The people have been lectured and told to change their ways. They are ready and eager to play a full part in reducing, reusing and recycling waste, but the Government is not giving them the opportunity to do so. Voluntary schemes are leading the way. I have noted that in County Louth a scheme has been introduced where national schools have reduced their waste by 60% through composting. Imagine what could have been done if we had a comprehensive, Government backed, waste management programme based on reducing, reusing and recycling. A new generation of young people are enthusiastic about this. It is they who are teaching older generations how to deal with this problem in a realistic and responsible way. I acknowledge and appreciate their input.</P>
    <P>The only acquiescence to this in the Bill is the introduction of the long overdue plastic bag and landfill levies, which I welcome. The Minister indicated that there would be a hierarchy of levies for landfill and incineration but I find that hard to accept or comprehend. The Government is reliant upon the incineration option to solve the waste management crisis.</P>
    <P>This approach is wrong for two main reasons. The first is that it is bad management because incinerators rely on a constant supply of waste, thus working against the most important form of waste management, which is waste reduction. The constant need to feed is patently obvious. What <Col N="1028" /> we will do if we adopt this and introduce incinerators is lock ourselves in for the next 30 years at least to the generation and creation of increasing amounts of waste to feed these monsters. The second reason relates to health concerns about incinerators. These have not been allayed and provoke growing public concern and opposition. I made the point strongly on Committee Stage that this is at a time when many other countries are rejecting and moving away from incinerators, halting new constructions and winding down existing plants.</P>
    <P>Why can we not look at the lessons to be learned from the experiences of other countries? Why must we ape and repeat the mistakes of others? A point that will not be lost on the broad mass of ordinary people in the State is that big business interests are at work in this trying to foist incinerators on the people of this island.</P>

      <P>I will assist in this regard. Although I am a member of the committee and have been working on this from the outset, I will conclude with these last few points.</P>
      <P>The Government has abdicated its responsibility and has placed waste management in the State in the hands of a powerful incineration lobby which is waiting in the wings, on the sidelines and on the margins for its chance to create large profits. The Government has dismissed lightly public concern on the health and environmental dangers of incineration. It has contemptuously dismissed local democracy in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I join with earlier speakers, Deputies Connaughton, Gilmore and Clune who have worked on this Bill from the beginning and whose efforts I commend, in a common appeal from all the voices of opposition to the Bill to the four Independent Members who hold the Government in office. As this is likely to be the final vote of this session, I appeal to these Deputies not to take away from elected members of local authorities the powers over waste management. We have few powers as it stands and few opportunities to influence positively and effectively decisions which will affect ordinary people in our communities. The Bill will allow the Government to ram plans for waste management and waste incinerators through local authorities by the diktat of city and county managers, bypassing democratically elected councillors and the normal planning process.</P>
      <P>Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox, Gildea and Blaney blocked the proposed ending of the dual mandate in the local government Bill. They did not do it alone. They had the support of other backbenchers as was demonstrated in the debate in the House in recent days. They claim they did so because they valued their roles in local authorities. The logic, therefore, is that they should defend local democracy and vote against this Bill. I appeal to them to recognise the import of what is before us and, when the vote is called, to join us in the lobby to defeat one of the most anti-democratic measures ever to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of my colleagues, Deputies Clune and Connaughton, to this draconian Bill. It is important to remember that, before the previous election, the main party in Government promised full consultation and involvement at local level. I cannot help but remember the commitments to the Army in Castleblayney that the barracks would not be closed without proper consultation. They promised better and meaningful local government. What we have today is the complete removal of <Col N="1030" /> the powers of locally elected people. If the Bill is passed, county managers, who do not have to go before the people, will have complete control. It may place them and locally elected representatives at loggerheads and cause major acrimony and problems in this area.</P>
      <P>Is it possible that a county manager in the last week of his term in office could sign one of these major orders, move out of the area and leave elected representatives and others to carry the can? Is there anything in the Bill to prevent that? I do not believe there is.</P>
      <P>While I wish the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, well in his recovery from his illness, it would have been good had he been present because he has brought this about. He has done nothing for four years in the recycling area. He is now trying to blame locally elected representatives.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might ask what I have done. As a representative for County Monaghan, I have been involved in trying to strike deals between farmers and the county council for landfill sites and obtaining grant aid for a recycling unit. That was delayed for some time and I am proud it is <i>in situ</i>. It will only deal with a small portion of the recycling which is possible but we must be serious about this issue. I do not accept the comments of some Deputies that everyone is willing and ready to deal with the recycling issue. Like Deputy Ó Caoláin and his colleagues, I visited sites in Denmark and Holland where things were supposed to work perfectly. The lorries are divided in two and are supposed to have the correct products in the different divisions. However, this has not happened despite all the education on the issue. Anyone who says it will be easy to get recycling up and running properly is not being realistic.</P>
      <P>The basic question I want to raise in the absence of the Minister is whether the Government is committed to eliminating county councils. What powers have county councillors left? Why will the Minister not say here and now that instead of better local government he wants to eliminate it altogether. The reason I say this is very simple. I have been a member of a county council for ten years and can say the county council has no say over the National Roads Authority. The authority which is currently becoming involved in my area is not prepared to pay proper prices for land and there is a dispute in the area this morning. County councillors have little or no say about regional or county roads. Decisions were once made at local meetings but that is no longer the case. We must now agree the list with Dublin, not with the county manager, before proceeding with works even on small tertiary roads. We were told last Monday that we have no say in regard to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the waste disposal issue, all we will be asked as councillors is to collect the money. We will have to ask people, even old age pensioners, <Col N="1031" /> the disabled and so on, to pay for the handling of waste. The Minister has imposed an extra charge with which councillors will not be able to deal. This will be dealt with at national level. This is the most draconian measure introduced in the nine years I have been in this House.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Bill will be guillotined is extremely serious. Like other Deputies, I plead with the four Independent Deputies who held up the Local Government Bill for the past six months until they got their way in regard to the dual mandate issue, to say what they will do today to retain the rights of locally elected representatives. Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae explained on the radio the other morning what he needs the money for. What will he do about this Bill? Will he defend the democratic right of the people who elected him by demanding his right as a county councillor or will he walk through the lobbies like a sheep? He did not defend the sheep farmers of Kerry, therefore, I do not expect him to defend anyone else today other than Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae and his three other colleagues. I name him in particular because he is the most vocal Independent Deputy who claims he is getting everything for Kerry, but he will now hand over the decision making powers of the county councils to county managers. Can a county manager on leaving a council sign documentation that will impose a system on an area when he is long gone?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for outlining the situation in County Louth. Having been a member of Louth County Council for 25 years I am well aware of the situation in the county which probably led in no uncertain terms to the introduction of this Bill. It was introduced because County Louth objected to the waste management plan in the region for very good and valid reasons. It is not insignificant that the chairman of the County Managers' Association happens to be the county manager of County Louth. It is well known that during the 25 years I spent on Louth County Council that county managers pressurised Ministers to eliminate section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, as amended in 1992. The reason was that this is the only real power members of local authorities have. This is a terrible day. I cannot understand the lack of interest in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I read in two newspapers this morning that I am supposed to be on three months holidays while coincidentally the most important Bill happens to be being debated on the last day, in the dying hours of this term of the present Dáil. This will have the most profound effect on the functioning of local democracy because it is exactly what the County Managers' Association wanted, the thin end of the wedge to eliminate section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1995, as amended in 1992. The Minister is handing them this on a plate.</P>
      <P>If one takes, for example, the proposal to build an incinerator in the Minister's constituency &ndash; I wish him well; it is a pity he is not here &ndash; in Duleek, County Meath, which is less than two miles from my town of Drogheda, that site is not zoned industrial, it is zoned agricultural. That means the members of Meath County Council could have refused to rezone the site by way of a material contravention of the Meath County Development Plan. However, as my colleague has pointed out, if the Bill is passed, goes through the Seanad and is signed by the President before the end of next week, the Meath county manager can simply tell the members of Meath County Council to go to the Laytown races and have a jump for themselves. That will be the effect of this Bill. The Meath county manager will make the decision on the incinerator, where it will go, how it will operate and so on. Members of Meath County Council, including members of the Minister's party, will have no say in the rezoning, materials used, the operation of the dump or the conditions applying to the planning permission which he will obviously grant. This is a deplorable and sad day for local democracy. I say that as someone who has spent half a lifetime on two local authorities in County Louth.</P>
      <P>The people of County Louth, including 26,000 people in Drogheda and 60,000 in its hinterland, are against incineration because of the health hazards involved and because there has not been sufficient discussion or consultation with local groups. As my colleagues have said already, this is the commencement, not just of the elimination of democracy within local authorities, but the beginning of public protests. These protests will commence in the town of Drogheda towards the last week of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister who does not live far from there should examine the matter because my estimation is that there will be a huge turnout against incineration on the outskirts of the town of Drogheda. This will be repeated all over the country, including in Galway and Kerry. Our Independent colleagues should take note of that because they will have to bear the brunt of it. They will have to explain why power was taken away from public representatives, who were elected to listen to the views of the people and <Col N="1033" /> reflect them at local authority level, and given to county managers.</P>
    <P>Four and a half years ago, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, introduced a Bill which effectively allowed for the creation of a waste management proposal on a regional or county basis. In County Louth, three years passed, but not one proposal was brought before the county council. I was not a member of the county council during that time &ndash; I did not run in the previous elections &ndash; but there were no discussions on waste disposal in those three years. It was only when the largest landfill site in Drogheda, the old cement quarry, closed that there was any discussion at all about waste disposal because there was no longer a dump in the town of Drogheda, which is the largest borough in the country. However, the debate should have started three years previously.</P>
    <P>They then wanted to bulldoze through a waste management plan that was not properly thought out. It was put together by consultants who did not live in the county and who did not have to stand before the people. It was supported by a manager and his officials who also did not have to stand before the people at local or national level. The Bill relates to a system imposed by people, from the county manager down and the consultants up, who do not have to stand before the people. This is the undemocratic system with which we are now faced. Our colleagues on the Government side, Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Party backbenchers, should think deeply about this matter because they will have to knock on doors during the next election and explain why they sold away local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments tabled by Deputies Clune, Gilmore and Sargent. The Bill is an enormous U-turn. In his introduction to his waste management policy document, Changing our Ways, the Minister said good waste management practices is a test of local authority environmental management and responsibility. He also said that waste management planning is clearly a task that should be addressed by each local authority. Councillors should be closely involved in the development of the policy approach which underpins each plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are being asked to endorse the opposite of that statement. The Minister has denied us the opportunity as councillors to develop and contribute to the plan. The volumes of material produced by consultants in supposedly developing the plan and the many other submissions made have been thrown back in our faces. We have been told that it must be done the Minister's way. His actions are nothing short of political bullying. I gave an example of this to the House previously when the Minister was in Galway for an official occasion. Due to the total opposition of the elected members, even those <Col N="1034" /> from his party, to his policy and waste management plan, he brought them into a room and told them that they must accept it. However, I am delighted that they rejected the Minister's bullying tactics. They believed the waste management plan we have been asked to adopt is flawed. Even at the last minute, I do not understand why the Minister cannot, as he has been asked, change his mind.</P>
    <P>The Government benches are empty this morning; not one backbencher is visible and the Minister of State is in isolation. It is difficult for him because he did not initiate the plan, but he is totally isolated from his party.</P>

      <P>The four Independent Deputies are not present but it is more shameful that Government backbenchers, Ministers of State and Ministers have not darkened the doors of Leinster House today. They are in hiding. That is an indication that they do not agree with the proposal. This is synonymous with the other disagreements in Government at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill goes against the Minister's four original ideas and ambitions regarding recycling, reuse, reduction and recovery. He has changed course and opted, through intimidation, for incineration and landfill. County Galway rejected them out of hand because we were denied any input into changing the proposals to ensure a good waste management plan for the county. We were not afraid to indicate where landfill sites could be located, if that was necessary. We challenged the consultants and we asked the manager to visit various sites that had potential, but which would not in any way intimidate local communities, interfere with their lifestyles or cause any risks to their health. They are entitled to object on the basis of their belief that an incinerator or a landfill facility could pose risks in terms of their environment, the value of their property and their health. However, the Minister wants incineration at any cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case, the recycling, reuse and recovery elements of his plan are redundant. The ambitions he included in the document were dishonest because he has a different plan. If the Bill is passed, reality will only hit the Minister when he returns. He may be available to take the debate in Seanad Éireann, but whenever he returns he will realise the folly of his ways in relation to his plan. We will not have incineration under any circumstances when alternatives are available. It is said that people are not educated <Col N="1035" /> with regard to recycling and reuse. However, they are not getting the opportunity to do those things. Deputy Michael D. Higgins will be aware of the pilot scheme in Galway city. Within a short period, it was shown that 60% of what previously went to landfill could be recycled and reused. This can be done nationally if we have the guts to say that alternatives are available and they must be adopted.</P>
    <P>Three communities in County Galway, Kilrickle, New Inn and Newbridge, have spent a fortune defending their entitlements. They have been tortured and hyped into a position where they are determined to defend their local environment by whatever means are necessary.</P>
    <P>The last straw is the Minister's decision to draw to himself the capacity to extend the Ballinasloe landfill site in volume and time as he wishes. It was not intended that a Minister would be entitled to do that against the will of people who have been magnificent in their willingness, in a crisis and while an alternative is being sought, to cater for the waste of Galway city and county. The Minister has taken to himself the power to direct the length of time the landfill can be kept open and the quantities it will accommodate.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be a member of a county council which rejected this plan. I am also glad we have an alternative plan, although the Minister will not even look at it. I hope the Minister reaps the reward of the opposition he will face in due course.</P>

      <P>I will respect the wishes of other Members and will keep my contribution short. I support every word my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, has said. This legislation would be more appropriate to a dictatorship than to a democracy. It is one of the most important Bills to come before the House. It makes a mockery of the inclusion in the Constitution of respect for local government and of the Minister's stated intention to give more power to local democracy. The Minister has taken away all trust in local councils and removed the concept of subsidiarity, in which we are all supposed to believe. He has taken power and responsibility from local authorities and his action will have far-reaching consequences, not only for waste management but for local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no point in giving five year terms of office to mayors who will have no power and whose councils will have no power. The Minister should think again. It is not an accident that the Minister <Col N="1036" /> of State is a lonely figure on the Government benches, with no support from his party or from the four Independent Deputies who were so strong in their demand to keep their seats on local authorities but who make very little contribution to the work of this House and who have made no contribution at all to the debate on this issue, which is central to local democracy. The people who voted for those Deputies should ask themselves what is the point of electing them to this House if they are interested only in keeping their two jobs while making no contribution to this central matter.</P>
    <P>I return to an interesting point made by Deputy Connaughton and I would like to hear the Minister of State's response to it. Deputy Connaughton asked if the plan could be modified by local authority managers. A waste management plan was adopted by my region, the mid-west region. Counties Clare and Kerry adopted the plan completely and Limerick city and county adopted it with the amendment that any decision with regard to a waste-to-energy plant &ndash; an incinerator, municipal dump or such like &ndash; would not be sited without the agreement of each of the two councils. The plan included a 41% recycling target and also targets for reuse and reduction of waste. Does this mean that no waste-to-energy plant, large dump or incinerator can be opened or constructed until the recycling targets have been reached?</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to be concerned only with the installation of incinerators and not with the other more important aspects of waste management. It is important that the Minister answers this question. None of us would stand over the abandonment of the most important aspects of our waste management plans in favour of the Government policy of installing incinerators. It would have been more courageous for the Government to choose spots on the map where incinerators would be built rather than give this power to local authority managers. The managers do not want this power. They are merely being asked to implement a Government decision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Independent Deputies and the Government backbenchers, who so vociferously expressed their views regarding their right to sit on local authorities, to vote against this Bill. If they do not, their so-called commitment to local and national representation will be seen to be hypocritical.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, which is one of the most important of this Dáil. The Bill will probably be passed today because the Deputies of whom I speak are probably not even watching the debate. If it is, I hope the Minister of State will ask the Government not to sign it into law because it will be a recipe for chaos.</P>

      <P>Because there is no doubt that the Government intends to bulldoze this Bill through the House today, I send a message to the President, the third element of the Oireachtas, to use the power given her by Article 26 of the Constitution to refer these sections to the Supreme Court for decision. What the Minister of State is doing on behalf of the Government is unconstitutional and he will rue this day.</P>
      <P>Where are the Fianna Fáil backbenchers? I have served with many of them on local authorities and they participate very well in politics at local level. Today, however, they are frightened into submission and silence because they are afraid of having their heads chopped off by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or of being deprived of some gift by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. They are hiding in their offices and have left the Minister of State to carry the can for the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows that the arguments he is hearing are valid. These sections proposed by the Minister are the result of massive failure in many areas, particularly that of waste management. I commend those councillors who have tried for many years to persuade us to recognise the value of recycling, reuse and reduction of waste. We have seen no effort by the Government to implement the directive on packaging reduction. Why do we not have a system such as we have experienced in other European countries where packaging is reduced to a minimum, customers bring their own shopping bags to shops, packaging is stripped from goods by customers in shops and the cost of removing that packaging rests with the producer of the goods or with the shop in which they are sold? For these reasons it is in the producers' and shopkeepers' best interest to reduce packaging to a minimum. We are approaching waste management at the hard end of landfill and incineration rather than adopting a proper policy of reduction, recycling and reuse.</P>

It does not drop from the sky. Will the Minister even at this late stage, to look again at what is happening here? I represent Fingal which for years has taken the bulk of the waste from Dublin city and county. Balleally tip head has been open for 30 years but it is not up to today's standards. In a few weeks' time the Government will be hauled <Col N="1038" /> over the coals by the European Courts. That is the reason it wants the Bill passed. It is only a fig leaf. God help us.

      <P>I am dealing with the section before the House. This section gives draconian powers to the manager with regard to waste management plans and the development plan. What is the value of councillors preparing a development plan if, under the provisions of one of these sections, the manager does not even have to put a material contravention. Section 4(3)<i>(a)</i> states:</P>
      <P>notwithstanding the fact that the proposed development would materially contravene the development plan, decide to proceed with the proposed development, with or without modifications. . .</P>
      <P>He can do it without modification. He can say that is the waste management plan and that he wants it on that piece of land and that is where it will be. Managers do not want this.</P>
      <P>If councillors think transferring the power to the manager will protect them from public criticism they should not have stood for election in the first place. Part of the reason we stand for election is to take on the responsibility for making decisions. I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister of State will recommit the Bill and not let it go through today.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support the amendments which seek to maintain some semblance of local democracy so far as waste management is concerned. This is an important function of a local authority and an issue that is crucial for all the communities concerned. Today the General Council of County Councils meets in Carlow and the general secretaries of the seven parties with Dáil representation are giving a presentation as we speak on the implications of the Local Government Bill on local democracy, while the Government is within a half an hour of smashing an important facet of that same local democracy in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Bill is to impose bigger landfill sites and to impose incinerators arising out of the grotesque failure of the Government to address the growing problem of waste management by meaningful and effective policies to reduce waste at source and to re-use and recycle. The provision of incinerators and more landfill sites is the wrong procedure in every sense. It encourages the accumulation of waste which is the problem that has to be faced. It encourages <Col N="1039" /> the throw-away practices of capitalist production, retail and consumption. Therefore, it carries on the excessive exploitation of natural resources which end up as waste after being used for a short period in many cases. This has critical implications for virtually every sector of the world. It has implications for the forests of the world which are under severe threat and are reducing by the year as a result of over exploitation, for the wildlife habitats in those forests, for the stability of the climate as it is now threatened by the excessive burning of resources and emission of pollutants.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of millions of pounds are proposed to be deployed to build incinerators. Instead, money should go towards reducing waste at source and into the technology of re-use and recycle. It is a false solution to say that incineration is a solution even for one simple thing. Apart from the health implications arising from the pollutants emitted, 40% or 50% of the space of compacted unburned waste will be taken up by the ash. It will have to go from the incinerator to landfill.</P>
    <P>The four Independent Deputies supporting the Government are ensuring the passage of the Bill. As has been remarked only a few weeks ago, the self same four stuck like barnacles to a rock in their opposition to Dáil Deputies being debarred from membership of local authorities. Contrast that with what is happening today and it reveals the stark picture of the Government being supported by four Independents whose driving force is only grubby self interest. What a pity they did not stay at the parish pump where they might have some role but even that is doubtful. Likewise, Fianna Fáil Deputies were whipped shamefacedly in here during Second Stage with prepared scripts from the Fianna Fáil production office and are agreeing because of their inability to stand up to the Government and to proposals that will have drastic implications for them. Some of them also threatened insurrection over the dual mandate and particularly over not getting the same salaries as councillors. Again, this is grubby self interest rather than the welfare of communities.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister a full and speedy recovery to health and send him the best wishes of the House. The amendments proposed are reasonable, fair, common sense and democratic. If the Bill proceeds without taking on board our amendments there will be widespread public disapproval. There will be huge campaigns because people will feel they have no democratic input into their local environment and that their rights are being ignored. People have a democratic right to change public representatives at election time. Politicians are elected by the people and they have to understand what people are thinking. Those who are elected have to respond to the wishes of communities and must understand that they want to have a say in how their lives are affected.</P>
      <P>Reports on incinerators and on landfill will be prepared by consultants. We get an abundance of consultants' reports nowadays. Usually, the consultants are groups of accountants, engineers and scientists who have no real understanding of the different areas about which they are making decisions. They are not from the area concerned and many of them are not even from within the country. Decisions made by highly paid consultants will affect the lives of people. It is a very serious mistake to leave the final say to county managers about where incinerators will be built or where landfill will take place. One of the amendments before us proposes to delete &ldquo;the manager&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;members&rdquo;. That is a common sense amendment which the Minister should accept. The decisions will be made by county managers from here on in. That is wrong. There is big money in waste &ndash; there are millions of pounds involved. Decisions on such matters should not rest with one individual in any given county. Those decisions should be made by politicians, after consultation with local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill flies in the face of democracy. It proposes to take away rights from public representatives. People criticise members of local authorities for not making decisions. There is criticism about the building and location of new housing estates. People are averse to having halting sites <Col N="1041" /> built near them. Other unpopular issues also arise from time to time and local authorities have met those challenges. They have provided housing in the face of opposition. Halting sites and homes have been provided for members of the Travelling community. Public representatives had the courage of their convictions, often against public opinion, to decide on the provision of such services. I believe that public representatives, if they are allowed, will be equally courageous in making decisions about incinerators. Legislation which allows county managers to make those decisions should not be shoved down the throats of the people. I do not believe that county managers want those decisions, nor is it fair to them to have to make personal decisions on such issues. Democracy should be respected. This Bill is a denial of democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important but shameful legislation. It marks an extraordinary day in the history of legislation. There are no Government Deputies in the House except Deputy Mattie Brennan and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. We are asked to agree to the diminution of the rights of local representatives and local democracy. I wish to deal with the implications of the enactment of section 4 of the Bill or, to put it another way, the defeat of the amendments directed at section 4. If the Bill is passed without the amendments in the name of Deputy Gilmore and others, it will be legally flawed for one fundamental reason. It seeks to give an appointed official the right to impose a levy for a strategy in relation to management of an issue such as waste management without the assent of elected public representatives. It further purports to give the right to an appointed official to vary a development plan which would have previously enjoyed the assent of elected representatives. Not alone does it give the right to impose an undemocratic strategy and a supporting levy which has not got public assent, it also proposes to shorten the appeal process.</P>
      <P>None of the existing guarantees in the City and County Management Act, 1955, as amended in 1960 and 1992, or the basic legislation on planning would sustain such an arrogant abuse of power. I believe the Bill will fall on the first challenge based on grounds of natural justice. Without dwelling on a point which has been made earlier, its constitutionality is open to question. Indeed, the Bill is unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Galway city, more than 30,000 people signed a public petition and supported a campaign which eventually led to the local authority unanimously rejecting the imposition of incineration. The Labour Party, the Green Party and other parties have been in favour of a democratic approach to waste management. The approach in this Bill is entirely wrong. It makes no reference to a hierarchy of <Col N="1042" /> waste management. It is offensively untrue to suggest, having taken the shortest, most irresponsible and most medically risky strategy which will voraciously require large volumes of waste, that there will be waste reduction, recycling, reuse etc. If one begins with that strategy, one has already driven all the other approaches &ndash; reduction, reuse and recycling &ndash; into the ground. They are killed before they start.</P>
    <P>Who does this serve? It serves those who favour one technical solution above every other democratic option. People should remember the County Management Act, 1940, and its original model in the 1920s which was based on the view that local representatives could not be trusted. It was amended in 1955 and was debated in the journal of the Institute of Public Administration between 1955 and 1960. Can anyone argue that the same conditions apply in local democracy in Ireland today as applied in the 1940s or the 1950s or whenever? We should be taking power from managers and giving it back to local representatives, rather than excluding local representatives and loading obligations on to managers. The suggestion under this system is that the manager can take the technical option and impose it on the elected representatives. In doing so, he is also excluding every ecologically responsible approach. Qualification of the plan is not allowed. Duties of managers are expanded in an undemocratic way. People are gagged with regard to an appeal. The development plan is thrown over. Planning permission can be given by the manager, who is also the only person to consider objections and there is no consideration for the democratic will of the people. I am not surprised that Government Deputies are unwilling to come into the House for this debate on such a profoundly outrageous and undemocratic Bill.</P>

I reiterate the concerns expressed by other speakers about the proposals in the Bill to take away from the elected members of local authorities the powers which they previously had and on the basis of which they were elected repeatedly. Handing those powers to county and city managers simply will not work. One of the lessons from recent electoral outings is that removing power from elected public representatives and bypassing them in favour of administrators is not democratic and is not seen by the people as democratic. Like Deputy Michael D. Higgins, I am not sure this Bill is constitutional. In the final analysis the people might give their answer at the polls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept these amendments as they seek, to one extent or <Col N="1043" /> another, to overturn or negate the main provision of the Bill and frustrate its key objective which is to provide a legal mechanism by which the current waste management planning process can be satisfactorily concluded as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, section 4 of the Bill, amending section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, provides that the power to make a waste management plan should be transferred from the elected members of a local authority to the relevant manager. It also provides for other supporting legislative amendments. This move will allow local authority management to conclude the planning process and clear the way to deliver on all aspects of waste modernisation &ndash; segregated collection services, higher recycling and recovery performance and a dramatic reduction in disposal to landfill.</P>
      <P>This proposed change will have effect only in respect of the small number of local authorities which have so far failed to make a waste management plan or which have purported to make a plan but whose decisions would be invalid by virtue of qualifications imposed. Obviously, it would have been preferable if the measures at the core of this Bill were not necessary. However, the waste management planning process has effectively been under way for over four years. Currently, three out of 15 local authorities in three regional groups have refused to adopt the proposed regional plan before them. The legal advice available to Government is clear. A proposed regional waste management plan must be adopted on the same substantive basis by all the authorities concerned, or none can be considered to have a valid plan. Therefore, the decisions of this small number of authorities are obstructing any prospect of progress on the part of the majority and have thrown the overall planning process into disarray.</P>
      <P>Because of the delays in making and implementing waste management plans, we have not made the progress that we all accept is vitally necessary and long overdue in the provision of the effective and cost efficient waste services and infrastructure. All the time the problems associated with proper waste management continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Clearly, we have to act now to put a modern and efficient waste management infrastructure and improved waste services in place. The Minister must have regard to the overall national interest and take steps that will facilitate the satisfactory completion of this planning process. He has considered the various legal options open to him and concluded that existing regulatory powers under the 1996 Act are not in themselves enough to ensure a decisive and satisfactory outcome. He is satisfied that the proposed measure is necessary and, in the circumstances, reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> I am not impressed by assertions that these proposals are an attack on local democracy. The Minister's record in supporting and empowering local authorities speaks for itself. It is also very significant that critics of these proposals have not put forward any viable alternative. The fact is that the <i>status quo</i>&ndash; ongoing impasse and drift &ndash; is not an option. Neither is the suggestion that local authorities, collectively or individually, go back to the drawing board after three or four years work. The reality is that unless legislative action is taken now to free up the planning process, our current difficulties in relation to waste management will continue to be needlessly compounded.</P>
    <P>I am equally unimpressed with the predictable assertions that the Government is pushing incineration. I emphasise that the proposed waste management plans are local authority plans and not about thermal treatment. They are about better services and an integrated waste management infrastructure serving the needs of each region. They are about the delivery of a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste that cannot be recycled and using landfill as the last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
    <P>Thermal treatment of waste, whether by incineration or other technologies, is only one component of this integrated infrastructure. One cannot segregate and recycle all waste. There will always be residual waste which must either be thermally treated or landfilled, and no amount of aspiration or pursuit of 20 year zero waste strategies will change this reality.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am satisfied that our independent planning and regulatory regimes, which will adjudicate on infrastructural proposals, will adequately protect and serve the public interest. New waste facilities of any significance are subject to full environmental impact assessment, planning controls and a rigorous environmental licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA must take the precautionary principle into account and is legally precluded from licensing a waste facility unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in accordance with a commitment I made on 11 April last, I laid before both Houses a report on allegations of an attempt to suppress evidence in the Arms Trial. I am conscious that, in the time available today, we <Col N="1047" /> can make only short statements and that in any event Members may wish to consider at greater length the contents of the report, but I thought it would be useful if we in this House had the opportunity to at least exchange some preliminary thoughts on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Arms Trial was not only a criminal trial of unusual importance but an event of political significance and historical interest. It took place against a backdrop of unprecedented civil disturbances and disorder in the North, events which still reverberate today.</P>
      <P>From the outset, therefore, I regarded the issues raised first by the <i>News of the World</i> newspaper and, subsequently, by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; as significant and requiring investigation, not only because they relate to the Arms Trial, important though that is, but because they question the integrity of the criminal justice system at that time.</P>
      <P>I am conscious too that the issues raised by the media have serious implications for the reputation and integrity of a number of persons who, in some cases, fiercely contested the most fundamental issues in the Arms Trial. Some of these persons are no longer with us and cannot defend themselves against allegations, and I know that the House will share with me a concern that any discussion of this matter should take account of that fact.</P>
      <P>The questions raised in the media amounted to an allegation that the statement of Colonel Hefferon, an important witness in the Arms Trial, was altered prior to inclusion in the Book of Evidence so as to remove from it references to the state of knowledge of the then Minister for Defence, Jim Gibbons, of the planned importation of arms. This was one of the key points of contention in the Arms Trial. At least some of the defendants claimed that the Minister for Defence knew of the planned importation, and at least tacitly approved of it, and that, far from conspiring to import arms unlawfully, they were acting at all times on the lawful authority of the Minister. The Minister for Defence always strongly denied this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the complication here that the Minister for Defence could, in any event, only have authorised the importation of arms for the use of the Defence Forces, and that if he had purported to authorise the importation of arms, this would only have been lawful if they had been intended for such use. This is a distinction of significant legal importance, but it does not take away from the central issue, which is that at least some of the defendants claimed to be acting on the authority of the Minister. Supporters of this view will no doubt point to the fact that while it is clearly not the case that the &ldquo;Berry markings&rdquo; coincide with the subsequent omissions from the Book of Evidence, it is the case that, in both instances, <Col N="1048" /> material tending to suggest that Mr. Gibbons had knowledge of what was taking place was at issue.</P>
    <P>In making my inquiries, I asked the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána for a report on the allegation in so far as it touched on their areas of responsibilities. Their reports are attached to my report.</P>
    <P>My objective in conducting my inquiries and in making my report to this House was to set out for the information of Members as much of the relevant evidence as is currently available. As my report acknowledges, there are difficulties in the way of establishing, in any definitive way, the truth of the allegations. We are dealing with events of over 30 years ago in circumstances where some of the central personalities are now dead, and where the documentation is incomplete. There is also the obvious consideration, which I mention in my report, that evidence of any conspiracy to pervert the course of justice would be very unlikely to be recorded in documentary form. Indeed, one would imagine that anyone attempting such a conspiracy would take care to avoid any appearance of impropriety. For all of these reasons, it is impossible, at least on the evidence currently available, to make an authoritative finding of fact in relation to the truth of the allegation. Instead, we must seek to establish the likelihood of any such conspiracy by reference to the existing documentation and the surrounding circumstances.</P>
    <P>I conclude in my report that, on the basis of an analysis of all of the available material, and on the basis of all other relevant considerations, it seems reasonable to infer that the likelihood of an attempt to suppress evidence is remote. I say that for a number of reasons set out in my report but, in particular, and apart altogether from the serious wrong involved in any suppression of evidence in a criminal trial, I think that is reasonable to seriously doubt whether a number of persons who held positions of responsibility would have engaged in a conspiracy which, from their undoubted knowledge of the law, they surely would have known was almost certain to be exposed. The risk would have been enormous. Any such conspiracy, if exposed, would have collapsed the trial, ended the conspirators' careers and, most probably, left them facing serious criminal charges. It is difficult to imagine such persons taking such a huge risk in circumstances where there would have been every chance of exposure and where in any event the potential gain was so uncertain, given that Colonel Hefferon was in any event going to give his evidence in court. I fully acknowledge that any conclusion as to the truth of the allegation must be qualified by the limitations I have mentioned and cannot, therefore, be definitive. It may be that others will form their own view of the evidence.</P>
    <P>Indeed, what I have set out to achieve in my report, with the assistance of the Attorney Gen<Col N="1049" /> eral and the Garda Síochána, is to put Members of this House, and the wider community, in the best possible position to form their own judgments in this matter by establishing the available evidence and publishing it. I do not claim to have any monopoly of judgment on this matter.</P>
    <P>For all that the documentation and other evidence is incomplete, it is still the case that these reports, taken together, contain detailed and complex information on the prosecution in the Arms Trial. I appreciate that Deputies will need time to consider more carefully the contents of these reports and to form their own conclusions. I am sure that more time will be needed in the House to discuss the matter further and when we resume after the recess, it can be dealt with again in the House in early autumn.</P>
    <P>I undertook to inquire into the allegation raised in the media and to report back to both Houses. I have now done so. The reality of the circumstances dictates that my report cannot reach definitive conclusions, but I hope Deputies will accept the report as an genuine attempt to establish as far as possible the circumstances which gave rise to the allegation. It may be that a definitive conclusion will never be possible. Certainly, the passing of the years will diminish the possibility but, in another sense, perhaps the passage of time will bring objectivity and perspective to our understanding of the events of 30 years ago and enable a fuller understanding of the events of that time. Perhaps, in this as in so many other matters, history will have to be the best judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues which resulted in the publication of last night's report and the Minister's speech relate to the most traumatic and dramatic trial since the State's foundation which involved senior politicians and events that rocked the country and the Government of the day. Those events impacted dramatically on developments within the Fianna Fáil Party for decades.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this truncated debate is taking place so shortly after publication of documentation yesterday. Most of us have only had an opportunity to read the documentation once and have not had sufficient time to analyse it in detail. I welcome the Minister's assurance that we will have a further opportunity to discuss this issue when the Dáil reconvenes in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of the Minister's speech is the reference to possible evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in the context of the extraordinary events which occurred in the early 1970s and the trial which ensued. The Minister stated fairly that no definite conclusions can be reached from the available documentation and the examination conducted. Having had an opportunity to examine the documentation provided to Deputies, there is something rotten about what occurred which requires further <Col N="1050" /> explanation. It is little short of scandalous that crucial and essential documentation relating to one of the major historical and political events of the early 1970s cannot be located.</P>
    <P>In the statement issued last night, the Minister refers to missing documentation, also referred to by the Attorney General, as including the following: the prosecution file, Garda investigation file, working papers from which the Book of Evidence would have been compiled and transcripts and sound recordings of the two trials. I wonder whether similar files on other issues have also gone missing. Serious questions must be asked about the files' whereabouts, the identity of the people responsible for their maintenance and of those with access to them and the point at which they disappeared. Were the files still in the Department in the early 1980s and had they disappeared by the 1990s? Were these papers and files interfered with in any way during Charles Haughey's tenure as Taoiseach? No one can say that the current Minister bears any blame for these issues but the questions must be answered. One would have expected the crucial background papers relating to this event to have been very carefully guarded.</P>
    <P>The investigation on which the Minister embarked with the assistance of the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General's report leave far too many questions unanswered. The catalyst for this investigation derives from a period during which a Member of this House, Deputy O'Malley, former leader of the Progressive Democrats, served as Minister for Justice in a Fianna Fáil administration. Deputy O'Malley has outlined his recollections of these events. In the document published by the Attorney General, statements made by Deputy O'Malley are queried. Questions were also raised by those involved in the production of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which was the prime mover behind the documentation published yesterday. It is important Deputy O'Malley puts on record his views of these events.</P>
    <P>The document to which &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; had access indicates that the Minister of the day, Deputy O'Malley, had sight of the documents to which Mr. Berry is alleged to have had access. Deputy O'Malley says he has no recollection of having seen them. Members of this House find it difficult to come to terms with these extraordinary events and the extraordinary revelation that essential files and papers are missing. The Minister indicates in the paper produced yesterday that he has raised questions about the missing files. Paragraph 15 of the paper states: &ldquo;The Minister has raised further queries on these matters and will report on the outcome of these queries when he has been provided with the answers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not detail the queries raised in yesterday's document but I felt that he would perhaps raise them in the <Col N="1051" /> House under privilege. I am disappointed he did not take the opportunity during his speech to detail precisely the queries he has raised about the missing documentation. The House is entitled to know this information and to know to whom the queries were directed. That such information is not being provided is disappointing.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me, it is not possible to deal in any detail with the information contained in the Attorney General's report. It is important, however, that one matter is put on the record to assist our knowledge of these events and in fairness to the people involved therein. In the detail of the Attorney General's report, he states: &ldquo;I have not attempted to formally interview any of the surviving lawyers or gardaí involved but I have had brief informal conversations with some of the lawyers involved.&rdquo; At the time of these events, Mr. Colm Condon, a distinguished senior counsel, was Attorney General and Mr. Séamus McKenna, also a distinguished senior counsel, was prosecuting counsel. Page 13 of the Attorney General's document reads:</P>
    <P>Séamus McKenna, SC and the former Attorney General, Colm Condon, SC have both stated that to the best of their recollection, they never saw the original statement of Colonel Hefferon. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the original signed statements were not in court and available to be used.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Séamus McKenna and Colm Condon and for the information of Members and those whose lives were so dramatically affected by the events surrounding the Arms Trial, it is important to clarify whether the informal conversations referred to by the Attorney General included conversations with Mr. Séamus McKenna and Mr. Colm Condon. The implication is that they did but we are entitled to confirmation on this point. That information should be made clear and should not be obtuse or a matter of public debate.</P>
    <P>Outside this House, members of the families of those affected by the trial that took place, Captain James Kelly who was prosecuted, and others have said there remain serious questions to be answered. It is clear that the documentation before the House, the information available to us and the general public, does not yet allow for the answers to be obtained to the questions that remain.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of this debate is one of those unusual areas that fall into that twilight zone between contemporary politics and <Col N="1052" /> history. More than half our population were either not born at the time of the arms crisis or would have been too young to have any direct memory of it. To these it would seem like ancient history, as remote as the Emergency or the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the principal actors in the drama are still alive and a number are still active in politics in the State. For these, the issues are clearly very relevant and capable of stirring great passion.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that events generally referred to as the arms crisis were among the most dramatic in the history of the State. Even at this stage it is difficult to come to terms with the concept of two of the most senior Ministers in the Cabinet being sacked, arrested and put on trial on charges of attempting to illegally import arms into the State. The events surrounding the attempt to import arms and the subsequent trial destroyed careers, divided political parties and families and could have plunged the country into civil war. The arms crisis was a direct result of the outbreak of civil disturbances in Northern Ireland which, in turn, flowed from the civil rights campaign and the response to it of the Stormont Government.</P>
      <P>In many respects we are still dealing today &ndash; it is apt that it is this very day &ndash; with the fallout from those events. It is ironic that we are discussing an attempt in 1970 to illegally import arms for use in Northern Ireland when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are preparing for intensive discussions with the political parties in Northern Ireland in Britain next week and among the important issues in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be involved is the decommissioning of illegally imported arms.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reports we have received from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner, but they do not add greatly to our knowledge. The allegation that the Minister for Defence at the time, Jim Gibbons, knew more about the attempts to import arms than was revealed at the trial is not new. It was dealt with in a number of books, an extensive series of articles in <i>Magill </i>magazine going back to the early 1980s and &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; produced material in the aftermath of those events. All this has been rehearsed in public before.</P>
      <P>Some commentators have talked about the need for some sort of formal inquiry into these events. Having read the documentation sent to us yesterday by the Minister, I am not sure such an exercise would be fruitful. It would not be a useful exercise for a committee of this House to engage in, but I am in favour of putting every shred of documentation in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, I welcome the motion passed by the House this morning regarding the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and its investigations <Col N="1053" /> of the time. I understand the Committee on Procedure and Privileges authorised the release, of which the House approved this morning, of almost all papers, but has elected to honour the guarantee given to witnesses who appeared before the committee at the time who are classified in language as &ldquo;persons outside the jurisdiction&rdquo;, that is, from Northern Ireland. On balance, that is quite proper and ethical. If the committee of the time gave that undertaking, it cannot lightly be set aside now. If it was, it would have repercussions for the workings of Committee on Procedure and Privileges in other matters.</P>
    <P>I have said that all the documentation should be put in the public domain and agree with the comment of Deputy Shatter that it is surprising and a little alarming that a number of documents referred to by him, the prosecution file, the Garda investigation file, etc. have been lost. I am suspicious enough to be fearful that there were people in office since 1970 who might well have had good reason to ensure some of that documentation went missing. I hope there is an investigation into that alone at a future date. I will pursue it by way of questioning and calling on the Minister to explain to the House how those relevant papers, documents, transcripts and tapes came to be missing. It is hard to believe that files central to such an investigation could go missing in this way.</P>
    <P>The events to which we are referring are historical but have resonances for today. Unfortunately we are living with the consequences of the awful events that resulted in 3,500 deaths in Northern Ireland that were contributed to by some of the actions that took place in the 1970s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated at the end of his speech that, &ldquo;Perhaps, in this as in so many other matters, history will have to be the best judge.&rdquo;  Would that it were so neat. In the interim some of us will have to come to some conclusions on the basis of what we have seen, what has been presented and what demands an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that Captain James Kelly and his family and John Kelly have paid an enormous price for the matters that have not been resolved and were addressed in RTE's programme. It is not a matter for academic history. It would be interesting if we were ever able to reconstruct the events that led to the attempt to import arms or the subsequent trial in which I would be as interested as anybody else. This raises many and interesting questions. It raises questions as to the relationship of members of the Cabinet to each other, collective responsibility, the relationship between the line Minister and the person in charge of a Department. It raises many more questions about the chain of instruction through delegated authority, in particular, in <Col N="1054" /> relation to the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>There are issues to which we will have to return. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admitted this and encouraged us to do so as we resume. These are fundamental issues. There is the issue of the integrity of the records. It is unacceptable that records that are so important in relation to the responsibilities of Cabinet, Ministers and administration would simply be missing. More questions are raised by the admission that they are missing. One must ask the question in what circumstances did they come to be missing.</P>
    <P>Issues also arise in relation to the integrity of the process of justice. I cannot see how the fact that statements were changed is affected by the speculation on who might possibly have any benefit to gain from such changes. That does not answer the implications of the conclusion, which is that the statements were changed. To say, for example, that we should get involved in a long speculation as to whether an interested party would take the risk standing to lose so much and would, therefore, attempt this and so forth is just what it is, empty speculation. The reality of the matter is that statements were changed and the change in the statements had a known consequence and effect on the lives of certain people. That matter cannot be left lying.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil resumes in the autumn we have to return to this matter and address the issue of compensating those who may have suffered wrongly on the basis, perhaps, of altered records. I cannot reach a conclusion on that point myself but the statements we are allowed to make today, in a short period of time, cannot stand as any obstacle to our returning to this matter in the fullest sense.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for those who are not free to speak and defend their names. One must do that as it is an enormously important ethical consideration and there are other participants at the time I am also interested in hearing from but this afternoon we will not be able to answer all the questions that remain. I counsel very strongly against any suggestion that we simply say that in these matters we will never be able to come to a conclusion. We have to come to a conclusion on the grounds of ethics and public responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reports of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner in respect of certain questions relating to the Arms Trial. It is clear from these reports that the changes made to the Hefferon statement were made by members of the prosecution legal team, in conjunction with the investigating gardaí who typed them; it seems these changes were made primarily in order to comply with the rules <Col N="1055" /> of evidence; neither I nor Mr. Berry had any involvement with such changes; and the claims of privilege were made on foot of legal advice and the certificates of privilege themselves were drafted in the Attorney General's office. These three reports are perfectly compatible with my statement of 9 May 2001.</P>
      <P>In the very limited time available to me it is impossible to traverse every aspect of this complex matter but I emphasise the following points. First, the clear impression created by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme was that the changes to the Hefferon statement correspond closely to the markings apparently made by Mr. Berry on that statement; that I had been furnished with the Hefferon statement complete with the Berry markings and that therefore I had colluded in deliberate and deceitful changes to that statement. As I pointed out in my earlier statement, there is simply no close correspondence between the Berry markings and the subsequent changes to the Hefferon statement. This conclusion is confirmed at page 17 of the Attorney's report.</P>
      <P>Second, it seems clear that the changes which were made to the Hefferon statement were made primarily to comply with the rules of evidence. Both the reports of the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney make clear that all the evidence demonstrates that these changes were made by the prosecution legal team and typed by the gardaí and that in any event there was no involvement by either me or any member of the Department of Justice in that process.</P>
      <P>A number of commentators have made the point that, while accepting that there were extensive changes to the other witness statements, the changes to Colonel Hefferon's statement were exceptional in that they altered the sense and intent of that statement and that none of the changes to other witness statements altered the sense and meaning of those statements. Here again this charge does not stand up to scrutiny. Two examples must suffice to make this point.</P>
      <P>Michael Donnelly of the Department of Justice made a five page statement in which he gave very damaging evidence concerning some of the accused. That statement was almost completely excised and the five pages reduced to a paragraph or so. The sense of that particular statement was completely changed in that all the damaging material was quite properly deleted on the ground, we must assume, that it mainly consisted of hearsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of Mr. Gibbons' statements. Large chunks of those statements, again containing highly damaging evidence and assertions against the accused, were excised and edited out. Thus, for example, Mr. Gibbons was asked by Chief Superintendent Fleming on 22 May 1970 two questions to which he replied in terms very damaging to three of the accused. These answers <Col N="1056" /> were not included in Mr. Gibbons' statement in the Book of Evidence, presumably on grounds that they contained a mixture of hearsay and opinion evidence. Yet these deletions also clearly altered the sense and intent of Mr. Gibbons' original statements.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the next question which none of those who contend a conspiracy occurred has yet answered. If there was a deliberate attempt to doctor the witness statement, why then was material damaging to the defence case also excised in the course of the editing process? As I pointed before, not all the changes to the Hefferon statement favoured the prosecution. Many were neutral and, on one view at least, some of the changes strongly favoured the defence. However, the extensive changes to the Donnelly statement, for example, all favoured the defence by excluding damaging and prejudicial hearsay evidence. The same could be said of many of the changes made to the various Gibbons' statements.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators have also questioned whether the changes to the Hefferon statement were, in fact, hearsay and have noted that Mr. Finlay, SC, was permitted to cross-examine Colonel Hefferon without objection concerning whether he had informed Mr. Gibbons about Captain Kelly's trips to the continent relating to the purchase of arms. If the relevant changes to the Hefferon statement were on grounds of hearsay, why, then, was this line of cross-examination not objected to by counsel for the prosecution, it is asked?</P>
    <P>First, I was not responsible for what prosecuting counsel does or did. Then, as the Attorney points out, this all depends on the view which the prosecution legal team took in advance of the trial as to issues which would be relevant to the trial. Again, as the Attorney notes, we all face the difficulty of attempting to reconstruct with hindsight what was in the minds of the prosecuting legal team in advance of the trial. Nevertheless, the statement by Colonel Hefferon to Mr. Gibbons as to the future intentions of one of the accused would seem in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in Cullen<i> v. </i>Clarke to be hearsay on the ground that it was not clearly the spontaneous declaration of the witness as to his own intentions. On the contrary, these Hefferon statements as to Captain Kelly's intentions were not in their context spontaneous and, moreover, as we have just seen, related to the intentions of another.</P>
    <P>As far as the issue of privilege is concerned, I must point out, as does the Attorney, that the claim of privilege was based on advice from counsel and the certificates of privilege were themselves drafted within the Attorney General's office. I repeat again that the file in respect of which privilege was claimed, file S/7/70, was in October 1970 a very different file from that <Col N="1057" /> released to the National Archives. In the intervening years, that file had become a sort of depository file within the Department for matters relating to the arms crisis and file S/7/70 today has documents which could not possibly have been the subject of public interest privilege, including, for example, the actual Book of Evidence itself, the trial exhibits, drafts of the claim of privilege and so forth. While unfortunately it is not possible to recreate the file as it existed when, based on advice from the Attorney's office, I claimed privilege in October 1970, it seems clear, as the Attorney points out at pages 19 and 20 of his report, that the claim of privilege related principally to matters relating to Mr. Berry's contacts with President de Valera.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is highly improbable that the Hefferon statement was contained in file S/7/70 as it existed in October 1970 or was the subject matter of a claim of privilege. First, as the Attorney concludes in his report, all the evidence points to the fact that the original of the Hefferon statement was already in court. What would be the point of claiming privilege in respect of the Department of Justice's carbon copy if the original of the Hefferon statement was already in court? Second, the privilege expressly contained a saver for inspection by the trial judge and, of course, if the original Hefferon statement had been deliberately suppressed <i>via</i> the claim of privilege, any such deception would have been immediately exposed had the trial judge requested to see the documents which were the subject matter of the privilege claim.</P>
    <P>For these and many other reasons contained in the three reports and in my own earlier statement, I trust that any fair minded person would conclude that the conspiracy theory has been shown to be without foundation. For my part, I repeat once again that I had no hand, act or part in the changes or editing of any of the witness statements. This task was undertaken by the prosecuting legal team who appear to have acted with total propriety in accordance with the accepted practice of the day.</P>
    <P>The events of 1969-70 presented a threat of unparallelled gravity to this State. Despite the acquittals, there is no doubt but there was a wide ranging conspiracy to import arms for the use of illegal organisations in Northern Ireland. By definition, this plan had to be illegal since, under the Firearms Act, 1925, neither the Minister for Defence nor the Minister for Justice had authority to licence imports of arms for this purpose. There is no record whatever of the Government ever having purported to take a decision to import arms for this purpose and the evidence refutes that contention. I know. I was there. I sat at the table from July 1969 onwards.</P>
    <P>Beyond the issue of mere legality, it is also clear that the plotters must have known that what they were doing had not been sanctioned by the <Col N="1058" /> Government. Why else would they have taken such elaborate steps to cover their tracks? Why was the cost of Captain Kelly's trips to the continent paid for out of the funds of Northern Ireland defence committees if it had been duly authorised? Why was there a departure from all known arms procurement procedures if the Department of Defence had sanctioned this purchase? Why would Captain Kelly not co-operate with the investigating gardaí or the Taoiseach if the operation had been duly sanctioned? Why was Captain Kelly, by his own admission, reporting to the Minister for Agriculture rather than to the Minister for Defence regarding his activities?</P>
    <P>Some of the commentary in the wake of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes sought to portray some of the defendants as some sort of a latter day Dreyfus, while others were even more blinded to the realities and denied that there ever was a plot to import arms. One denied that the murder of Garda Fallon had any bearing on the arms crisis. Yet there is some reason to believe Garda Fallon may have been murdered in April 1970 with a weapon which had been part of earlier illegal arms shipments into the State. There is also reason to suppose that some senior gardaí suspected that a prominent politician was fully aware of this earlier importation and had turned a blind eye to it. These same gardaí became aware through intelligence reports that by December 1969 certain politicians were funding illegal organisations. Such was the depth of the crisis which confronted Mr. Berry in April 1970 and which &ndash; following my appointment as Minister for Justice in May 1970 &ndash; I, in turn, confronted. Had Jack Lynch, Peter Berry and various Ministers been less than steadfast in their determination to preserve democracy and the rule of law, heaven knows what catastrophe would have befallen this State and the people of the entire island.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; has raised questions about the conduct of the Arms Trial itself. These questions have now been comprehensively answered in so far as they can be at this remove, and I am glad to note that my reputation and that of the late Peter Berry have been vindicated. Now that these issues have been determined, I want answers as to the arms crisis itself. Who conspired to import arms? Which politicians conspired to defeat the democratic process through this illegal importation? Which politicians conspired with members of illegal organisations? Which politicians encouraged the establishment of the Provisional IRA? What happened to the bulk of the money voted for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland? These, and many other questions about the events of 1969 and 1970, merit answers. We may now have moved into the realm of modern history rather than of current affairs. That, however, does not stop certain media people trying to construct a story in current terms. If they want to do <Col N="1059" /> so they should get the facts and the details right. Sensationalism and history are rarely compatible. The truth is often boring and unexciting, especially if it is complex. History cannot be written from a superficial view of one document, backed up by a sense of mission. As the historian Ronan Fanning puts it &ldquo;while good history can make good news, what is newsworthy is not necessarily good history&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ten minutes on this topic is ridiculous. I wanted, for example, to quote extensively from the military intelligence files in the National Archives. I cannot. Because I cannot, and unless some other Member of the Oireachtas does, no writer can because he risks being sued, as the archives themselves reportedly have been. Injustice can be easily perpetrated, and not just in a court. Television is a powerful and potentially lethal weapon. It should be used to crusade only with care and genuine fairness.</P>
    <P>If I had been dead who could or would have defended me? It took a month of hard work by me, and by two skilled people who helped me, to produce my statement of 9 May and to remove the obloquy. That should not have been necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is right in saying that there should be time to put everything which he would like on the record. The files of the National Archives should be laid before both Houses so that the type of information that is there can be made public. A short debate like that today can take the general debate somewhat further, but it is very limited. I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 11 April and I welcome the fact that the Minister has made further inquiries. We only got the information at 6 p.m. last evening and the most any of could have done is to have a quick read of the complex data which will have different meanings for different people. Deputy O'Malley would bring a certain perspective to it, as everyone does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, which Deputy O'Malley has criticised, shows that public service broadcasting is important. Information has been uncovered in these reports and it is important that it has been revealed. The information the Attorney General has put on the record is important. There is detailed analysis of Colonel Hefferon's statement. Why certain things were edited &ndash; which were clearly marked in each part &ndash; and the reasons for that are not clear to the Attorney General. The Attorney General is not sure why some of information given to the former Minister, Mr. Gibbons was edited. The Attorney General's analysis of the deletions of Colonel Hefferon's statement raises worthwhile questions which cannot be adjudicated on today. In time, and with various inputs, those questions will be considered. That is an important process. The <Col N="1060" /> opening of archived files is a worthwhile, if sometimes painful, process. It is not something on which we can give a judgment at short notice.</P>
    <P>The arms crisis was a most traumatic time in our history. Maybe upon learning what we have come to accept, there can be a process of expressing doubt. It will take time for the implications of the material which is in this report to be understood. We will need historians to help interpret this, we will also need to re-interview those from that period. Deputy Michael D. Higgins said that we do need to be informed of the quality of the archives and the integrity of the files and I agree with him. These are questions which need answers. As politicians we want to create the conditions where an open and free discussion on this can be possible and that the information can be placed in a open and accessible way.</P>
    <P>It is both extraordinary and disturbing to read in the report of the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that in the course of the investigation it became clear that a number of documents and files that could be germane to an investigation of the matters alluded to in the <i>News of the World</i> and &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme were either missing or otherwise not available. I do not know what &ldquo;otherwise not available&rdquo; means, perhaps the Minister will tell me when we return to this discussion. It is incredible that the prosecution files, Garda investigation files, working papers from which the Book of Evidence would have been constructed and transcripts and sound recordings from the two trials are missing. The Minister should return to this House with as much information as possible on this. There should be a report to the House on this and questions must be answered. How did this happen? Is there a possibility of this happening again? Who took these files? Are there so many files in the Department that these have not yet been accessed? How can a comprehensive report be compiled when these key files are missing?</P>
    <P>In other countries, when files were opened, extraordinary information emerged. Where countries had more troubled histories than us, more extraordinary information emerged. Entire populations had to rethink their history and what they thought of it and realise that their loyalties had been betrayed. Many would say the exercise in which we are involved is historical, but there are lessons to be learned. It is important for us, as citizens, because the arms trial was a period of loyalty and betrayal of alleged sovereignty and treason. There are fundamental issues which require further investigation and teasing out.</P>
    <P>People have suffered, reputations have been put on the line and individual families have had very difficult years as the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme showed. The experiences of Colonel Hefferon and Captain Kelly and the families' views as reported on the programme were such that, while a microcosm and one part of this affair, one could not fail to be struck by the <Col N="1061" /> effects this period had on their lives. The detailed work by the Attorney General, especially on Colonel Hefferon's statement, needs to be teased out further.</P>
    <P>As one goes through the report, many questions come to mind and there are many points one would like to raise. For example, the Attorney General confirmed that, before the 1970 Arms Trial, the key statement of the former head of Army intelligence, Colonel Michael Hefferon, was extensively edited. He said, however, it was and is usual practice to edit statements. He also said the edited version of Colonel Hefferon's statement was probably prepared by gardaí in Dublin Castle under the supervision of prosecution lawyers. However, there is a separate short report from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Mr. Patrick Byrne, who states that no member of An Garda Síochána edited any statement taken during the course of the investigation. That is another point which raises more questions than it gives answers.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and the Attorney General say they cannot come to a comprehensive understanding or absolutes on this matter. The Attorney General said there is no prospect of an official, authoritative, objective and generally accepted history of the events now being written about. That may be true, but I have no doubt that conducting this type of analysis, making the material available, returning to this debate later in the year, putting more information before the House and granting a full debate to allow those who want to put detailed accounts on record are very important. I welcome these developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. I wish to register my deep dismay that I and fellow Members are expected to debate a report a mere 24 hours after it was published. It is of crucial importance to the State and the well-being of our democracy and concerns a subject matter which was a watershed in the country's history and subsequent development. From the beginning the affair has been surrounded by controversy, cynical opportunism, dirty tricks, allegation and counter-allegation. It was and remains sensational. The episode dubbed the Arms Trial remains unresolved after more than 30 years.</P>
      <P>Its complexity and intrigue are illustrated by the fact that this report was only published yesterday, almost six weeks later than the date specified by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. Given its obvious complexity and the gravity of the issues which go to the heart of what we consider accountable democracy and fair administration of justice, no one bar its authors can in a 24 hour period reach an informed and considered conclusion on its contents. A cursory glance shows that even the authors appear unable to arrive at any firm conclusions. Many noble, honourable and honest people had their lives wrecked, careers ruined and reputations impugned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So as not to rush to any premature consider<Col N="1062" /> ation of the report, I have decided not to comment directly on its findings. To do so would be wrong. The Government has done the people, this House and those involved a great disservice in arranging a hasty and paltry one hour debate, even before the ink was dry, on an issue of such magnitude, especially given that the House is to adjourn today for the summer recess. This issue and the report are too important to be treated so scantily and hastily. It is little wonder there is such cynicism among the people towards politicians and the House. Democracy, if it is to thrive, demands open and firm debate and thorough analysis from its elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tried his best to make the report available much earlier but was frustrated in doing so. I thank him for his statement and agreeing to arrange a full debate on the matter in early October after the Dáil resumes. I look forward to taking part in that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital we put the Arms Trial in its proper context. An extraordinary feature of the debate in the State since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; revelations in April has been the extent to which it has focused almost exclusively on events on this side of the Border. There has been little mention, let alone exploration, of the reasons arms were sought in the first place. All the emphasis has been on the crisis within Fianna Fáil and the machinations in and around Government Buildings and Leinster House.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is not alone in what I regard as the totally false view that what was at issue in 1969 and 1970 was an alleged threat to democracy in this jurisdiction. In this fairy tale version of recent history, the late Jack Lynch saved the people from anarchy and civil war. This grossly partitionist view deliberately ignores the catastrophe experienced by the Nationalist people of the Six Counties. People were killed by the B-specials and the regular RUC in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. They were forced from their homes, their streets were burned and we had one of the largest forced movements of the civilian population in Ireland, if not since Cromwell then certainly since the Famine. This was the real threat, crisis and catastrophe in Ireland in 1970 and it was not in the leafy suburbs of Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>The problems in 1970 were not what the Government did but what it failed to do. It failed to come to the defence of those under attack by the forces of the Orange state. It failed to confront the British Government with its responsibilities. The Nationalist people saw the prosecution of the defendants in the Arms Trial as confirmation that the political establishment in the State had abandoned them and was concerned only with its own partitionist political interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is clear from a preliminary reading of the reports is that they raise infinitely more questions than they give answers. There is a glaring contra<Col N="1063" /> diction between the Attorney General's report, which states that the edited version of Colonel Hefferon's statement was probably prepared by gardaí in Dublin Castle, and the report of the Garda Commissioner, Patrick Byrne, which states that the gardaí were merely typists of the statement and that &ldquo;no member of the Garda Síochána edited any statement taken during the course of the investigation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Attorney General's report is the list of documents and material which have disappeared since the trials. These include the prosecution file, the Garda file and working papers relating to the preparation of the book of evidence. What has happened to these documents? I believe there was a cover-up and that they were concealed or destroyed to serve that cover-up.</P>
    <P>The reports published last night do nothing to undermine the view that Colonel Hefferon's statement was edited to hide the knowledge and involvement of the then Minister for Defence, Jim Gibbons, in the arms importation. It should not be forgotten that the accused in the arms trial were acquitted. Two of them are in this building today, my colleague Sinn Féin Assembly Member, John Kelly, and Captain James Kelly. A key reason for the acquittals was that they were seen as the scapegoats while the Lynch faction in the Cabinet protected itself from the consequences of actions which had been initiated by the Government and not by the defendants.</P>
    <P>The reports published last night strengthened the demand for a public inquiry into this whole affair. In conclusion, I call for such an inquiry to be established without further delay.</P>

I am aware the committees of the House will be sitting throughout July and September. It is true that &ldquo;rust never sleeps&rdquo;. I also express the wish that the media will have a pleasant and enjoyable summer and that they will obtain a break and I thank them for their co-operation.</P>

      <P>I join with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in expressing my good wishes to the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the staff of the House for a very happy and well deserved summer break as it has been a very long session. I wish to take this opportunity of thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for running a very orderly House and being courteous to all of us who I am sure at times tried your patience. I thank the staff of the House, including the staff here who serve parliament and democracy. I thank the wider staff of the House, including the staff in the restaurants, the ushers, staff throughout the House and the staff assigned to the political parties, including secretarial staff and so on. Everyone has had a very long session and worked very hard. Sometimes those who work the hardest get the lowest profile and I would like to acknowledge their work. I am conscious of the fact that the committees of the House will be going ahead in July and September. Many of our colleagues will be engaged in those and the staff of the House will also be engaged in servicing the committees. Therefore, it is not as if we are going out when the school bell rings today not to be seen again until the school bell rings again on 3 October. There is a lot of work being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we stand here today we hope the Northern Ireland talks will be successful. I hope the negotiating position has been re-established and I intend to approach this as I approach other matters. I am optimistic. I think the parties on all sides, even though they contend and debate, are committed to peace, the peace process and the successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I believe all the pro-Agreement parties are bona fide in their attempts to reach a resolution and I hope that resolution can be reached with the help of the two sovereign Governments in the next two weeks or so. This is very important to all of us because, while the plenary session of the House may close down, politics goes on. The politics of Northern Ireland seem to dominate the summer and I hope before we get into the real difficult times that a resolution to <Col N="1065" /> outstanding problems can be arrived at in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>By next year I hope I will be wishing everyone well from the seat in which the Minister is now sitting. He spoke about this Administration being the longest since the Second World War; it certainly feels like that. Without being facetious, anyone who looks at the health services would think there are almost as many casualties. It is as if the Minister was extricating himself from Stalingrad. I have no doubt that when the summer passes and if it is decided to have an election in October we will be building on our success in South Tipperary and that the electorate will be building on the message they sent from South Tipperary. If the Government decides to go on longer, then it will certainly be the longest Administration since the Second World War and it will be like the retreat from Stalingrad or, to go back to a previous age, the retreat from Moscow. I do not think there is any Napoleon currently on the Minister's side to pull things back together. I wish the Administration well. It has been a long session and they need the rest. We will be working throughout the summer but I hope Members on the Government side enjoy the break.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party mentioned that the committees will be meeting in July and September. I expect to be back here next Tuesday, not at the normal time of 2.30 p.m. but at 11 a.m. for the beginning of oral hearings on the European Convention on Human Rights Bill. The committee of which I am a member will sit on Thursday next week and we also have business on Wednesday. The members of the justice committee have full business with which to deal next week and the week after which will occupy the committee rooms of this House and on occasion over the next number of weeks other venues in the city. I hope the Fourth Estate, which I also acknowledge and thank for their coverage of the last plenary session, will now refocus their gaze to that neglected section of the House, the committees, which do a lot of work and are rarely reflected in any significant media coverage. Colleagues who tabled hundreds of amendments and argued them for weeks on end got no coverage or acknowledgment for that work. The reconstitution of the work of the House through the committees is <Col N="1066" /> something we need to work on, not just in its workings and resources but the way in which we present it to the public at large.</P>
    <P>I look forward to some break in August and I wish my colleagues throughout the House a restful few weeks during August. I also join with Deputy Noonan in wishing the Executive well because, whatever battles we fight here, the Government of Ireland is the elected Government by the people through this House and they bat on all our behalf.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, every success in the very challenging discussions which will begin in England next week. There seems to be a permanent crisis pertaining to Northern Ireland. Every Member of the House wants the unresolved intricacies of the Good Friday Agreement brought to a satisfactory conclusion so that the normal politics of this island, North and South, involves improving the living standards and the lot of every citizen and not the preservation of peace as a fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his courtesy. The House may not return on 3 October because more than one straw in the wind suggests the good people of the State may have an opportunity to exercise their democratic right to pass judgment on the Administration before we meet in plenary session again.</P>

        <b>:</b> The business on the last plenary sitting day of this session is a fitting tribute to the past four years of Government. Cynical legislation, in the form of the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, was rushed through today which will remove a significant plank of local democracy. The business of the past three weeks has involved the cynical pushing through of legislation without any proper scrutiny because of a lack of time. I pay tribute to my staff colleagues but also to the staff of the House who have been put under unreasonable pressure by the incredible number of late sittings.</P>
      <P>I hope that over the summer the country will have time to reflect on four years of this Government and some of the disastrous decisions that have been taken. Its most shameful monument will be the privatisation of public assets over the past four years. Vital resources, such as telecom operations and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, have been handed over to multinational companies. No publicly owned resource is safe from the Government which plans to privatise Aer Lingus. The Government should keep its hand off Aer Lingus because it will face a massive campaign of opposition from the staff and other people against the privatisation of the national airline.</P>

    <P>The rejection of the Nice treaty in the ballot box showed that the Government has lost any confidence the people might have had in it. Rather than writing itself into the history books <Col N="1067" /> as the longest serving Administration since World War II, if it returns in October, the Government should write itself out of office by going to the country in September and giving the people their say on some of its disastrous acts.</P>
