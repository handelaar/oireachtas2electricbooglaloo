      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business I wish to inform the House that with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery is the President of the Parliament of Iceland, Mr. Halldór Blóndal, who is accompanied by parliamentarians from the Althingi. It is an honour for me to extend to you, Mr. President, and your delegation a warm welcome to Dáil Éireann. I know that your visit significantly increases the co-operation and friendship between our two Parliaments. I look forward to a further strengthening of these links which are to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I have <Col N="2" />received notice from Deputy Healy and call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of immediate importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make a full statement to the House announcing the abolition of domestic refuse charges in view of the recent Supreme Court judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the serious situation which has arisen whereby staff are on a go-slow in the office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in Letterkenny which deals with child benefit and optical, dental and medical appliances, and at the <Col N="3" />office of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Galway. In both offices staff are refusing to take telephone calls from the public or public representatives or deal with correspondence. This action is causing great inconvenience and stress for the general public and I ask the relevant Ministers to intervene.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business shall be No. 49, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a private notice question being allowed it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will probably recall the last general election campaign when his party gave a commitment to zero tolerance and when the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform travelled the land like a latter day angel of death. Arising from this and, in particular, the crime survey carried out at the direction of the Minister by the National Crime Council of Ireland, is the Taoiseach aware that only one crime in four committed in Ireland is recorded as being reported? The other three are not recorded as being reported and do not appear in official statistics. Will the Taoiseach take measures to ensure all crimes are reported and that victims of crime are supported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been more than a 200% increase since the 1950s in reported crimes. Will the Taoiseach disown the silly remark of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who indicated with pleasure that crime was now at 1950s levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the crime levels in the recent report, but also note the official figures which show that crime is down by 21% in the last reported year. Crime was down 25% last year on the projected figures. There were around 81,250 indictable offences in 1999, the lowest in over 20 years. Of course, we will continue to make sure that crime is reported, in so far as this is not being done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general view, even in this House, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is one of the best we have ever had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That view is certainly held by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but is not universal. The report establishes that the principal reason crime is so under-reported is the fear of victims to report crime and their belief that if they report crime, nothing will happen or be done to assist them. Does the Taoiseach agree that this is an appalling indictment of the criminal justice system in terms of those most hurt by crime? What will he do to ensure official crime statistics reflect reality? Second, what will he do to remove the fear of victims afraid to report crime to the Garda Síochána and their belief that if they report crime, it will be totally ineffective because nothing will happen as a result of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an excellent criminal justice system and a very good independent courts system. We have increased the numbers of gardaí and resources. I do not accept that anyone would be fearful or concerned about reporting crime. People are satisfied to report crime, even in areas with the highest crime levels. We must continue to encourage them to report crime. We have a good Garda Síochána and criminal justice system and people should report crime. It is a question of the reason they do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in so-called disadvantaged areas, areas more marginalised than most, the reality is that people have faith in the Garda Síochána and the courts system and use it fully. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been extremely helpful in regard to victims of crime. A network is now set up throughout the country whereby <Col N="5" />resources are made available to try to engage with the victims of crime. There are victims of crime who are severely traumatised. We saw such a case last night in regard to a young girl. There are systems and schemes in place which should be supported. The Minister is providing the resources to support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's proposals in the House yesterday to deal with the huge public alarm concerning allegations of Garda misconduct in County Donegal are wholly inadequate? Does he accept that there have been three private internal inquiries lasting for a considerable time which neither resolved these matters nor even allowed them to be fully ventilated in the public domain? Does he accept that yet another behind closed doors inquiry by an individual with no statutory authority can achieve nothing other than to bury this issue, as the Minister intends, until after the next general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party has on several occasions expressed its fullest confidence in the Garda Síochána, a force founded by the founders of this State in 1922. I put it to the Taoiseach that nothing undermines public confidence in the Garda Síochána more than a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who refuses to take action when it is quite obvious that action should be taken. Rather than appointing an eminent legal person to examine the situation in County Donegal, in circumstances where he has had all the files available to him for the past three years, is it not time for the Cabinet to consider a full tribunal of inquiry into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy try due process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with this issue in the House. In reply to Deputy Noonan, the House will be aware of what the Minister stated. He said the legal advice from the Attorney General was to look at what options are available and carry out an appropriate examination into these matters. He has already indicated that these issues create an enormous level of concern and has been more forthright than anyone on the issue. The advice he received pointed to the serious difficulties that would arise while civil and criminal proceedings are still pending and that these proceedings should be allowed to run their course. That is the legal advice which must be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account the difficulties identified by the Attorney General and addressing what Deputies Noonan and Howlin have said in regard to public concern about these matters &ndash; no one denies there is public concern &ndash; the Minister has decided that the best way to proceed is to ask an eminent legal person to examine all the papers available, including the progress on the investi<Col N="6" />gations generally. Given that expert independent advice, he will then consider what measures he might take to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later. He hopes to be in a position to appoint the person concerned shortly and will inform the House of the circumstances of those conclusions.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that, based on the same advice, we have taken that view in regard to many other issues in recent years. We did so some years ago when in the process of sifting. We did so in regard to Mr. Justice Buchanan and Mr. Justice McCracken, which later led to tribunals. We received the same appropriate legal advice in regard to those issues. The Minister has served the public well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated, as did the Minister yesterday, that the Government wishes to bring these issues to a conclusion and get at the truth. Does he know that the inaction of the Minister has resulted in one of the civil cases being delayed for more than six months? Given the myriad of inquiries, one after another, in secret, with no information coming into the public domain, does he accept that the public would quite properly come to the conclusion that the Minister is engaged in ensuring the matter is buried until beyond the next general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusions will be made public in the House just as the Minister made a statement in the House yesterday. The House and the general public need an authoritative independent assurance that everything possible is being done to bring these unsatisfactory matters to a conclusion. That is what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing. The action now proposed will achieve this without running the risk of jeopardising the civil and criminal proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I dealt specifically with the issue of suicide and termination of pregnancy in the case of a person who is suicidal. There is still stigma surrounding the whole area of suicide and while much has been done since the report of the national task force on suicide, there is a dearth of discussion and understanding of the complexity of suicide.</P>
      <P>Last year more than £21 million was spent on road safety and £1.2 million on suicide prevention. However, more people die as a result of suicide than die on our roads. The issue of suicide in pregnancy has been simplified during the discussion, both in the House and outside. Suicide is a very complex issue and there is a debate over whether women who are suicidal and pregnant should be allowed to have an abortion. I do not accept that.</P>
      <P>I see women who are pregnant and suicidal who can be treated and recover. There are women who are suicidal who can be shepherded through their pregnancies and come out at the end of it cured. However, there is a small number of cases of women who are suicidal, who are intent on taking their lives and whose lives are in danger if those pregnancies are not terminated. I accept this is a very small number of women, but these are real people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, the Government has rightly determined that an intervention can be made in the event of a threat to the woman's life because of physical illness. Is it not discriminating to say that if there is a real and substantial threat to a woman's life because of mental illness and the intent to take her life, a termination should not take <Col N="15" />place? Surely we are applying different standards in deciding on a termination in the event of a real threat to the life of a mother because of a physical illness and having a different standard for those who are severely mentally ill and suicidal. A pregnant woman who is suicidal would probably not be in position to travel because of the seriousness of her condition. The few people whose lives are threatened because of pregnancy are seriously ill and may not be physically or mentally capable of travelling for abortion to the UK.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, the question of litigation in health and medical care was raised. This issue should be seriously examined by the Government because doctors, physicians and psychiatrists should have protection. I would be extremely concerned about any suggestion of litigation in a case where a psychiatrist decides an abortion should not take place and the woman subsequently dies by suicide.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister stated that the Bill removes the possibility of abortion if suicide is threatened, which was a central issue in the X and C cases. I do not believe the threat of suicide should simply be a reason for abortion. I referred to the hard case where clinically a person was at a high risk of suicide &ndash; it was almost inevitable that she should die by suicide &ndash; which is the situation that should be dealt with. If it were permitted, there should be a detailed, controlled procedure for the final decision. A suggestion I received was for independent second and third opinions on the degree of suicidal risk. It is simplistic of the Minister to talk just about threatened suicide as an issue. It is more complex than that. A panel of psychiatrists should be available to the Department of Health and Children to examine any such cases, and people from outside the patient's health board area should be consulted.</P>
    <P>It is simplistic of the Minister to state that it is difficult to assess if a risk of suicide is genuine. There are risk factors which can be explored concerning the individual herself, such as if she has a severe mental illness. Some 15% of people who are severely mentally ill die by suicide. Previous attempts, the storing of tablets, and the means used are barometers for the psychiatric profession to assess risks. The Minister is being too simplistic when he says it is difficult to assess the risks of suicide because psychiatrists make that decision on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the Government is satisfied there would not be widespread support for providing abortions to women in crisis pregnancy, which would open the way for abortion on all grounds. What does the Minister mean by a crisis pregnancy? I have not heard it explained. Most people accept it is an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy, but a crisis pregnancy can arise in many situations. A planned pregnancy can become a crisis one and therefore we must be careful in using such language. A person with a planned pregnancy can subsequently have both physical <Col N="16" />and mental complications which turn it into a crisis.</P>
    <P>A meeting in Cork was addressed by the internationally recognised compassionate sociologist, Rev. Fr. Charles Ruby, of Chicago who has been involved for many decades with the suicide bereaved. He works with the Catholic charities of the arch-diocese of Chicago and publishes a monthly magazine, <i>Obelisk, Leaving Outreach to the Survivors of Suicide</i> for the suicide bereaved. He said that death from a physical ailment was a consequence of that ailment, in other words, a death from cancer was due to the consequences of that disease. He compared this to suicide as a consequence of a severe mental and despairing disposition or condition. The Government stated that its proposals are specifically drafted to ensure the non-recognition of a risk of suicide as a grounds for lawful termination of a life of the unborn does not result in persons, who would otherwise be free to travel abroad, being refused permission in any circumstances by any court exercising its personal jurisdiction over them from doing so. The Government is saying it is essential to a suicidal disposition that the woman can travel to the UK, and that there is nothing in the proposed amendment or the envisaged legislation that would render it illegal for the health board to assist the woman to travel outside the jurisdiction. People in extreme distress and in a suicidal condition would not be capable of travelling abroad. Some of them would be hospitalised because they need constant psychiatric care. What is the answer for a person in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>We must put suicide in pregnancy in context. Studies in this area accept that women who are pregnant are less likely to take their lives than those who are not. Louis Appleby's studies over ten years found that the risk of suicide in pregnancy in the UK was one sixth of that expected for non-pregnant women. A total of 14 pregnant women died by suicide between 1973 and 1984, compared to an estimated and statistically expected 281.5 non-pregnant women. Research shows that pregnant women had one-twentieth of the expected rate of suicide. That led Appleby to say that pregnancy protects women from suicide. The 1999 study in the United States by Marsock shows that a pregnant woman has about one in three-tenths the chance of dying by suicide as that of a non-pregnant woman of similar age. These percentages are low and the dearth of research in the area limits knowledge in the area of the effects of pregnancy on suicide.</P>

      <P>I know of Deputy Neville's great interest in suicide and I was surprised that he accused the Government of discriminating against women who are suicidal by not allowing them to have a termination of pregnancy. I would have thought he would have had the evidence that was presented to the All-party Committee on the Constitution as well as medical evidence from all around the world. That evidence takes a <Col N="17" />view contrary to Deputy Neville's, the facts are there to be seen. Pregnancy is not a risk factor in suicide. Deputy Neville referred to the Appleby study which showed that pregnant women aged 15-44 were 20 times less likely to commit suicide than non-pregnant women. Pokorney in the United States found that 0.6 per 100,000 pregnant women committed suicide while the rate for non-pregnant women was 3.5 per 100,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy accused the Government last night, he said, &ldquo;It is discriminatory to say a woman who is seriously suicidal and who is suffering from a serious mental health condition cannot be protected in terms of terminating her pregnancy while this can be done where a woman is in real danger due to a physical illness.&rdquo; All the medical evidence points to the contrary. A study in Finland showed that while pregnancy is a potent protector against suicide, induced abortion appears to be a risk factor. The survey showed that 73 women who committed suicide from 1987 to 1994 found a mean annual suicide rate of 11.3 per 100,000; the suicide rate associated with birth was 5.9 and that associated with induced abortion was 34.7.</P>
      <P>I am sure that neither Professor Casey, the professor of psychiatry at UCD, or Dr. Kevin Malone, who is probably doing the most research on an all-Ireland basis, would agree with Deputy Neville. They are certainly not saying that they are unhappy with the Bill. When the Supreme Court dealt with the X case, the late Dr. Kelleher &ndash; who had a very distinguished record in research into suicide in this country &ndash; pointed out that &ldquo;[suicide] is a rare event and in all rare events the greatest likelihood is that the event will not occur. The research evidence indicates that medicine and psychology does not have ability to predict suicide, even with a moderate degree of accuracy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of doctors attended the hearings of the All-party Committee on the Constitution including Dr. Sean Daly, Master of the Coombe, Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda, Dr. Anthony Clare, director of St. Patrick's Hospital, Dr. John Sheehan, consultant psychiatrist at the Rotunda and Dr. Hannah McGee representing Psychologists for Freedom of Information and they all had the same view. The general thrust of findings presented was that completed suicide during pregnancy is significantly reduced over <Col N="18" />and above the levels in non-pregnant women of similar ages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They pointed out that for every 100 cases of suicide predicted, the prophecy was wrong 97 times.</P>
      <P>The evidence of Dr. Anthony Clare is also worth looking at. He said:</P>
      <P>If I were to summarise, I would say that the only real reason . . . you will find psychiatrists involved in this is, because, . . . we have been drawn in to try and get people off the hook over this issue . . . who better than to get the psychiatrist to tell you that if this is refused, this woman will kill herself. Well no such statement can be made with any great safety, whether the person making it is a psychologist, psychiatrist or a general practitioner.</P>
      <P>As a medical doctor and a former general practitioner, my main concern with the judgment of the Supreme Court was that it would open the way for abortion on demand. Suicide is a subjective feeling. If a woman were to go to her doctor and say she was going to commit suicide if she could not have a termination of pregnancy, no doctor &ndash; psychiatrist or GP &ndash; or anybody else is in a position to say if she will or will not commit suicide. It could lead to abortion on demand and that is one of the reasons I am delighted to see the Government going back to the circumstances that existed prior to the Supreme Court decision.</P>
      <P>The Commission of Enquiry into the Abortion Act, 1967, in England was chaired by Lord Rawlinson. It reported:</P>
      <P>The Commission heard from witnesses representing the Royal College of Psychiatrists who stated that although the majority of abortions are carried out on the ground of danger to the mother's health, there is no psychiatric justification for abortion. Thus the Commission believes that to perform abortions on this ground is not only questionable in terms of compliance with the law, but also puts women at risk of suffering a psychiatric disturbance after abortion without alleviating any psychiatric problems that already exist.</P>
      <P>The woman who has depression or who feels suicidal during pregnancy, is certainly entitled to full services support, but the answer is to offer appropriate psychiatric help. The full range of psychiatric services should be and are available to those women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The title of it explains what it is about, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. The protection of human life places a major responsibility on the State and on the professionals who have responsibility for ensuring a safe pregnancy. It is always important to recognise that there are two lives involved &ndash; the mother and the child in the womb. This legis<Col N="19" />lation is caring, compassionate and balanced. It provides for the woman and her child and at the same time ensures that medical procedures necessary to save the life of the mother will not be denied.</P>
    <P>Before the 1997 general election, the Taoiseach promised the people that they would have the final decision on this by way of referendum. He is now fulfilling that promise. I am disappointed at Members of the Oireachtas who do not want a referendum. Everybody has to accept that a referendum is the greatest act of democracy that is available to the people. It is right to allow the people to make a decision by way of referendum on this tremendously important issue. It is also right that the legislation, when enacted, can only be changed by way of referendum. It would not make much sense to consult the people and then tell them the Oireachtas could overrule their decision. It is, therefore, right to go to the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised a referendum in 1997 and I commend him and the Government for not rushing because the approach they adopted to this difficult and complex issue was correct. Work on the Green Paper commenced in 1997 and concluded in December 1999. That was recognised by Professor Bonnar when he appeared before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. He is one of the most eminent obstetricians and gynaecologists in the State. He has recently retired as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in Trinity College, Dublin, after 25 years and is chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He referred to the Green Paper as one of the most comprehensive documents he had ever seen in regard to legislation on abortion.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Green Paper was followed by the hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was very ably chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan who was ably assisted by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. They invited and received numerous written and oral submissions and interviewed many individuals and groups with particular expertise in the complex issues involved. This was followed by the work of the Cabinet sub-committee and the presentation of the legislation by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>There is a legislative prohibition on abortion while at the same time best medical practice is preserved. I have no doubt people do not want a law which would compromise existing practice that is geared to protect both the mother and the child. The legislation meets that requirement. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution received numerous submissions from the medical profession, particularly members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who are the experts in the field of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The institute stated in its submission:</P>
    <P>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is the professional body representing the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland. The executive council of the institute <Col N="20" />has examined the Green Paper on Abortion and the members have been consulted. We welcome the Green Paper, which provides a comprehensive, up-to-date and objective analysis of the issues arising in the care of the pregnant woman. Our expertise is in the medical area and our comments are confined to these aspects.</P>
    <P>In current obstetrical practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention is required at a stage in pregnancy when there will be little or no prospect for the survival of the baby due to extreme immaturity. In these exceptional situations, failure to intervene may result in the death of both mother and baby. We consider that there is a fundamental difference between abortion carried out with the intention of taking the life of the baby, for example, for social reasons, and the unavoidable death of the baby resulting from a central treatment to protect the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>We recognise our responsibility to provide after care for women who decide to leave the State for termination of pregnancy. We would recommend that full support and follow up services be made available for all women whose pregnancies have been terminated whatever the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph is very important. When Professor Bonnar attended the committee he elaborated on the submission. He pointed out that the principle underlying the work of obstetricians and gynaecologists was to protect the lives of both the mother and child. He hoped they would never be compromised by the introduction of abortion in the sense that he would use, in other words, simply asking the obstetrician to intervene to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. That represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the people and the legislation is very much in line with that.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings more clarity to this complex issue than the 1992 legislation. Abortion is clearly defined as &ldquo;the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman&rdquo;. The definition of abortion excludes medical procedures that are necessary to save the life of the mother. Many people are concerned and they are writing to Members on a daily basis about the protection of life before implantation. Article 40.3.3. of the Constitution protects all human life and the proposal before us is not intended to address the wider concerns in the area of assisted human reproduction and issues such as stem cell research and cloning, which have serious consequences. The legislation is specifically concerned with protecting the life of the unborn during pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in cloning, stem cell research and IVF are very difficult, complex matters and they are being addressed by the Government in the context of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which was established by the Minister for Health and Children <Col N="21" />in March 2000. This expert commission has been asked to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in the area. I have no doubt when it reports more legislation will be necessary because it is a complex area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the crisis pregnancy agency. As a medical doctor who has worked in general practice, I am well aware of the trauma of unwanted pregnancy and I take Deputy Neville's point that crises can arise in a normal wanted pregnancy, although they are generally referred to the obstetrician who is competent to deal with these cases. The Minister, in establishing the crisis pregnancy agency, has recognised this problem which must be addressed in a caring way. There is a need for more education, advice and support during pregnancy for the women involved. Support services must also be provided for women who have had abortions abroad and these services must be delivered in a sensitive and compassionate manner. I am delighted that the Minister is providing &euro;6.5 million in 2002 for the agency. I have no doubt the agency will do a good job.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I will ask people to come out and support the proposal in the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the most serious reservations about the Government's proposals. They deserve serious consideration and both I and my party have given them such but at the end of the day one must examine what the outcome of these proposals will be if they are implemented.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the result of the Government proposals will be to reduce both the rights of the unborn and the rights of women as they exist now. One cannot deny that incontrovertible fact.</P>
      <P>On that basis I find it very difficult to support such an approach. The problem for the unborn is that the proposals infer that implantation rather than conception is the first moment of life. Thus the proposals provide no protection for the unborn in the period between conception and implantation. As I understand it this period can range up to about 14 days. I heard the medical evidence at the All-Party Committee and I gather that what happens is that it takes six or seven days before the fertilised ovum &ndash; at that stage called the blastocyst &ndash; begins implantation. Normally by day 14 that implantation is completed. What is very relevant is that section 1 of the proposed Bill very clearly provides protection after implantation. What is the situation about protection in the 14 days prior to implantation? A satisfactory answer has not been given to that question by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals and the result of these proposals will be to reduce the rights of women. Under the proposals a medical procedure as a result of which unborn human life is ended is not regarded as abortion where, in the opinion of the <Col N="22" />doctor, such is necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life. However, this exemption specifically excludes the risk of loss of the woman's life by self-destruction. What is currently provided for as a result of the Supreme Court decisions in the X and C cases is being excluded. Essentially the Bill says that serious physical conditions are covered by the exemption but not conditions now covered, such as black depression leading to suicidal tendencies.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Dr. O'Hanlon when he analysed the evidence before the all-party committee in relation to suicide. I accept the evidence given that the tendency to commit suicide is reduced as a consequence of pregnancy rather than otherwise. However, from the point of both physical and psychiatric conditions these are rare cases. Similarly, the evidence of the masters of the three main maternity hospitals was that these physical conditions are very rare; they talked about a few each year where therapeutic procedures had to be carried out which resulted in abortion for reasons of grave physical difficulty experienced by the expectant mother. We are talking about quite rare conditions. Do we condemn those who suffer from those rare conditions to bear with them and perhaps to die? I do not think we as legislators can very easily differentiate between the two. I question the advisability of setting aside the judgment of the Supreme Court in a way that will reduce the rights of women in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the tone of this debate. We had considerable debates at the all-party committee which were conducted under the very able chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I was delighted to be vice-chair and to participate with him in those discussions. They were very serious discussions but everybody tried to contribute in a very fair and reasoned and reasonable and sensitive way. I am pleased that the debate in the House is along the same lines.</P>
    <P>The onus of proof is on the Government. It must convince the Dáil and the people that there is merit in the proposals. So far, that onus has not been discharged. To a large degree that is the background for the very reasoned approach that Fine Gael is taking to these proposals. We tabled a reasoned amendment because we believe this is a very complex area. The proposals are quite unusual &ndash; a constitutional cocktail that has not been seen before.</P>
    <P>At the time of the all-party committee report we committed ourselves to giving the most serious consideration to any proposals that would be put forward and on that basis we have strongly proposed a deferral of the second reading to allow further time for discussion; to allow the Government time to present to the Dáil satisfactory reasons for the mechanisms being proposed. I am quite concerned about that constitutional cocktail and its implication for the Oireachtas and the courts and the public interest. There is no advantage in rushing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of this House in 1982 and 1983 <Col N="23" />when I saw an amendment that was pushed on the Dáil against the advice of the Attorney General, against the advice of the Minister, and against the advice of the then Government. There was a tide of emotion behind that amendment. I will never forget that because it showed that one does not legislate properly on a tide of emotion; in fact those who pushed that amendment found that the chickens came home to roost. The warnings at the time were that the amendment could lead to a judicial interpretation contrary to what the proposers felt they were proposing &ndash; and that is what happened. We must be very careful in our legislation and we must be very careful about how we amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of the procedures being adopted. The ship of state is heading into uncharted constitutional waters. There were warnings in 1982 as to the unpredictable consequences of the approach then adopted and we must also sound a warning. There are dangers in attempting to graft a constitutional prohibition on to the legislative prohibition. I worry about this approach and that the consequences of that approach may be quite unpredictable and certainly need to be teased out and examined further.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a situation where the Government seeks to justify legislation on the statute book which cannot be amended by the Oireachtas but which under its provisions can allow a Minister make regulations without any reference to anybody. That seems to be a very odd approach and it certainly has not been justified by the Government. The Government is saying that one must go back to the people to amend the Bill but at the same time the Minister of the day will be able to make orders under section 5 without even having them approved by the Dáil. I accept that such orders will be laid before the Dáil in the Oireachtas library, just as is the case with hundreds of other orders. Everyone knows the practical effect of that is that, as a consequence, nothing ever happens on the floor of the House. I consider such an approach to be undemocratic and in fact anti-democratic. It is a Committee Stage point but one aspect in relation to section 5 is odd. Under section 5, the Minister is allowed to make such provisions relating to the making of, keeping of and confirmation of records but, under the definition section, there is an implication that he is entitled to establish approved places, which effectively will be hospitals or clinics, where abortions can be carried out. There is no specific power under section 5 to make an order in relation to approved places and perhaps this point could be noted for clarification because it may be defective drafting.</P>
    <P>The overall point is what type of democracy we have and what type we want. We are part of a tradition of representative democracy. These issues were considered hundreds of years ago in terms of the difference between the direct democracy school and the ideas of Rousseau and the <Col N="24" />school of representative democracy under which people would be indirectly consulted through representatives, as favoured by John Stuart Mill. Most Western democracies adopted the representative approach, the only exception being Switzerland which uses the direct democracy model. However, what the Government is trying to do under the Bill is contrary to our constitutional and democratic tradition. It is grafting on the direct democracy approach to our existing constitutional and democratic model, which is dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 100,000 submissions and representations that were made to the all-party committee. I analysed many of them and 95,000 of them demanded support for option one in the Green Paper, which is an absolute constitutional ban on abortion. The postcards and petitions were organised throughout the country because some people genuinely believe that is the right approach; they got 95,000 people to sign petitions and write postcards along those lines. However, it was clear from the evidence given to the all-party committee that if that route had been followed, women could have been condemned to death. One could not accept an absolute constitutional ban on abortion because it would effectively outlaw existing medical procedures in the rare cases where therapeutic intervention is required, resulting in the termination of pregnancy, to save the life of a mother. This is a warning to us.</P>
    <P>People who favour a further referendum at this stage in the main accept that option one, an absolute constitutional ban on abortion, is out the window. They accept the medical evidence given to the all-party committee in that regard. However, they now want some type of half way measure. Their approach is that half a loaf is better than no bread. My view is that the half a loaf approach could give rise to severe constitutional indigestion because a half baked half loaf could cause damage. It could produce unpredictable results and make the situation worse in the future. The idea that there should be some type of referendum on some type of half baked half loaf, rather than no referendum, will do nothing for those who are genuinely concerned that abortion could become available in Ireland. I do not believe that approach would in any way guarantee the desired result. My view is that we must proceed with extreme caution. Unless we are convinced beyond reasonable doubt, we should not proceed at all along the constitutional route.</P>
    <P>I question why we are involved in this exercise at all because we are not having a serious debate about abortion. The first point about any policy that is supposed to address the issue of abortion is whether it will reduce the number of Irish women who have abortions. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; because, irrespective of the type of constitutional or legislative procedures that are put in place, they will have no impact whatsoever on abortions carried out in Ireland given that there is none. The only abortions carried out are those under <Col N="25" />approved medical procedures to save the life of the mother. Nevertheless, 7,000 Irish women and girls have abortions each year and these proposals will not affect one of them.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that the X case judgment had no impact of any kind on current medical practice in hospitals. No abortions are carried out in the State because of the threat of suicide and the Medical Council guidelines suggest that any doctor who performs such an abortion would be guilty of professional misconduct. We want to exclude suicide as a ground but this was put before the people in 1992. In substance, we have returned to the position in 1992 when that proposal was rejected by two to one.</P>
    <P>We should be debating the £50 million plan that I, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, proposed to the all-party committee 18 months ago. There is no debate on that plan because serious issues arise in terms of how it should be implemented. Another aspect is that because of the time being spent on considering legislative and constitutional proposals, which will have no impact whatsoever on the rate of abortion, we are not expending energy on considering what type of proper plan should be put in place to help the women involved and establish preventative and educational measures. We should decide whether to adopt a contraceptive approach or one of the other approaches advocated before the committee. However, nothing is being done about this aspect.</P>
    <P>I am glad that 18 months after I bored the committee to tears by pressing this issue at every meeting there is a proposal to set up an agency, which will be operative next year. Why are we not debating what that agency should do to bring about a result? What type of support will be available to young girls or women in crisis pregnancies? What support in terms of counselling and medical check-ups will be provided to women who have had abortions? These aspects are not being debated. If we are really concerned about reducing the rate of abortion and supporting women and girls with crisis pregnancies, we should debate issues such as what we can do in practical terms for them.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted by the Government in sailing into uncharted constitutional waters is dangerous. There is a risk that the use of a constitutional amendment as a procedure to accommodate specific legislation in the Constitution could establish an undesirable precedent in so far as a similar approach might be used to facilitate interference with other constitutional rights. The Oireachtas must reflect carefully before adopting any particular technical approach of that type because of its potential to reduce or alter other existing rights in the future. On that basis, I strongly urge the Government to accept the Fine Gael Party's amendment and to defer the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to welcome and discuss the Government's <Col N="26" />package of proposals for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of human life in pregnancy. The issues we are discussing are complex and sensitive. They relate to the protection of unborn human life and ensuring that pregnant women continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment where such treatment becomes necessary in the course of pregnancy.</P>
      <P>I regard this issue as one which deserves to be lifted above the level of the cut and thrust of party political debate. The issue is too sensitive for that type of treatment but it is an issue which demands to be resolved. I firmly believe the Government's proposals strike the right balance, delivering constitutional, legislative, caring intervention in the area of crisis pregnancy. I wholeheartedly agree with the view expressed by the Taoiseach that doing nothing is not an option. The reality is that previous attempts to reconcile the rights of the mother and the unborn child were rejected by the people in the 1992 referendum. At present, the only real defence against widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion in Ireland is the ethical consensus in the medical profession.</P>
      <P>The express terms of the 1983 amendment to the Constitution demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas. However, no laws were enacted on foot of that amendment. The proposals currently before us represent the Government taking its role as legislators seriously. It is fair to say the outcome of the various referenda left a widespread feeling of unfinished business among the people. This places a heavy onus on us as legislators to provide the leadership necessary to underpin the issue of the protection of human life in pregnancy. The Taoiseach's stated position in the 1997 general election was that a key element in establishing a national consensus and in creating a workable legal basis for protecting the lives of both women and the unborn is to give the people a direct say in resolving that unfinished business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once in Government, we set up an interdepartmental working group whose findings were considered by a Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. This led to the publication of a Green Paper in September 1999 which was subsequently referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and the committee's vice-chairman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for their work on and commitment to this project. The proceedings of the all-party committee and its subsequent report were generally fair, balanced and of great value in educating and informing public and political opinion. Certainly, as far as the Cabinet sub-committee, subsequently re-formed following publication of the all-party committee's report in November 2000, and on which I have the honour of serving, was <Col N="27" />concerned, that report and the preceding process of consultation and inquiry was of immense value.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee was given the task of considering options and preparing proposals for consideration. I can truthfully say this process was not easy but I believe we discharged our onerous responsibility with sensitivity and frankness. That process brought the sub-committee to this stage. The Government has concluded that no simple sentence or paragraph can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues surrounding the protection of human life in pregnancy. Having carefully reviewed all of the information and advice available, there cannot be any doubt that the proper place to strike that complex balance is in legislation passed by the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution. I have no doubt the proposals before us in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill are the first legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment to the Constitution and the X case.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this is no knee-jerk or sloppy response to an issue which causes much pain and suffering. It is a measured and calculated response developed only after much deliberation. It is worth restating what the Government has decided to do. We will put an amendment to the people which will result in two new subsections being added to Article 40.3 of the Constitution which will give constitutional protection from the adoption by the Oireachtas of a legislative approach, thereby guaranteeing that the terms of the legislation will be seen and approved in advance by the people and provide that any future legislative amendment must be approved by the people before being signed into law by the President. This approach, modelled on that used successfully in regard to the Good Friday Agreement, puts this issue where it belongs &ndash; on a legislative basis and in the hands of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The constitutional changes being sought ensure the legislation has a sound constitutional basis and that the balance so carefully struck will not be threatened by a legal challenge from any source. It also gives the people the assurance that they must be consulted in the event of further proposed change. While we are addressing the complex issues surrounding the protection of unborn human life, we wish to ensure at the same time that pregnant women continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancies. A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will occur only if the Oireachtas enacts the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act in the precise terms published as a schedule to the Bill within six months. This is only right and proper as it is imperative the Irish people know exactly what they are voting for.</P>
    <P>The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Consti<Col N="28" />tution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 is in line with the third option outlined in the report of the all-party committee. For the first time, the Bill protects women and the unborn in pregnancy. It accommodates existing medical practice which safeguards the life of a woman from exposure to real and substantial risk. It gives complete protection to the medical procedures necessary to avoid those risks and excludes them in the definition of abortion. The House will be aware that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity, procedures can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn. However, the new law defines abortion in a way which clearly excludes such ethically legitimate procedures from being termed an abortion under our criminal law. I remain convinced that in terms of the balance we know is so necessary, the measures protect the life of the unborn in the strongest possible way and most definitely do not provide for social abortion.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy stated in 1992: </P>
    <P>In the context of the eight years that have passed since the amendment [the 1983 pro-life amendment], the failure by the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate, it is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>Nine years on, that statement has achieved an even greater force. That is why the Government has resolved to face up to the issue once and for all and to create the proper context in which an appropriate legislative response can be placed on the Statute Book. It creates the framework within which we, as legislators, can exercise our responsibility in the name of the people and with their express endorsement. This issue is sufficiently important for us to adopt this strategy.</P>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that the issue of suicide is a difficult one for many people. The Bill provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in this State. The Government believes the conclusions of the report of the all-party committee do not support maintenance of the suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland, a view with which I fully concur. It should be noted that suicide risk has been advanced only as a ground for abortion in cases in which the State, directly or indirectly, attempted to restrict a woman's freedom to travel. The terms of the new law will protect that freedom and will not compromise it in any way.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for stating my opposition to so-called social abortion. I do not support this so-called right and would not be standing here today in support of the Government's proposals if we were legislating for such an outcome. I believe the Irish people are implacably opposed to social abortion and I am glad to say the Government shares that opposition. I am aware that not every viewpoint or interest group will be entirely satisfied with every detail of the package being presented by the Government. If they were, this <Col N="29" />issue would have been resolved long ago. However, the Government has achieved a package of measures which can command sufficient broad-based consensus to be workable and which recognises the rights of the unborn child and the pregnant woman. It is a reasonable and measured response capable of resolving an issue which has exercised our minds for so long.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals are innovative in that they adopt a holistic approach, concentrating not just on legal-constitutional issues but also on caring and practical intervention in the area of crisis pregnancy. A study commissioned by the Department of Health and Children entitled Women and Crisis Pregnancy gave some useful insights into the factors leading to crisis pregnancy and the experiences of women in that situation. Furthermore, the all-party committee identified a range of issues to be addressed in any strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It recognised that several Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities in this area and that a single planning focus was required to ensure successful intervention with women attempting to deal with crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <P>Law is only one element of the picture; education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways equally important. That is why the establishment of the new crisis pregnancy agency by the Minister for Health and Children is a crucial element in the Government's strategy to deal with this important issue. The crisis pregnancy agency will draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy, to promote options other than abortion and to provide for post-abortion services. The agency will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to do all we can to mobilise the resources of the State to assist women who have to decide whether to proceed with a pregnancy. Crisis pregnancies result in a significant number of Irish women travelling abroad for abortions. The State must use all its means to strive honestly and fairly to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy. Those who face such problems must be assisted to become aware of their options other than abortion. We should enable them to consider carefully such options and assist them to make decisions. The new crisis pregnancy agency will deal with many issues, including those I have outlined. Crucially, preventative measures, including the education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed by the agency. It will work with a wide range of organisations, in the health, education, employment and housing sectors. I am glad the agency will promote prevention. The all-party committee recommended that the agency be established for ten years initially and this has been done. Initial funding of &euro;6.5 million will be provided for the agency by the Government in 2002.</P>
    <P>The package of measures that has been proposed should lead to a reduction in the incidence of crisis pregnancies and will give the widest poss<Col N="30" />ible assistance to women facing such difficulties. I reject the inferences made inside and outside the House that the Government's proposals are, at best, inadequate and, at worst, misogynistic. The issue of suicide has been used to attack the Government's proposals, but no reasonable or workable alternative to the balanced constitutional and legislative framework that is at the heart of the Government's caring strategy has been suggested. The evidence, analysis and conclusions presented in the all-party committee's report do not support allowing the risk of suicide to be given as a ground for abortion. The conclusion of the committee members is backed by the testimony of psychiatrists, whose testimony did not support the thesis of the termination of pregnancy as a means of alleviating the threat of suicide.</P>
    <P>Abortion is one of the most difficult issues with which a woman can be faced, privately and publicly. We should not run away from it because it is a difficult issue. As male and female legislators, it is our duty to address the painful and difficult issues that abortion raises. The proposals to be put to the people represent a fair reflection of the belief that abortion should not be permitted in this country. The medical procedures required to protect the lives of pregnant women need to be safeguarded. I have made no secret of the fact that I support the right to life of the unborn child and am opposed to abortion on demand. The Government's proposals offer strong protection to the unborn and ensure abortion on demand will not be available. I welcome this Bill's protection of the life of pregnant women and its introduction of the necessary supports to deal with crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <P>Debate on this topic will never be easy, but we must debate it. I firmly hope that as the debate moves from this House, it will be conducted in a tolerant atmosphere, without acrimony or bitterness. We must accept that there are strongly held views on abortion. We do not have to endure intolerance, personal vilification or scaremongering on either side of the argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear this debate will add to the cynical or indifferent view of politics held by many Irish people. It is estimated that 7,000 Irish women will have abortions this year, which means we have one of the highest rates of abortion in Europe. Irish women's abortions do not take place on Irish territory. Instead of addressing the real issue, public representatives are being asked to try to include an exact wording in the Constitution to balance the conflicting rights of a mother and her unborn foetus. This seems to happen once every decade, but we have to ask if we will ever succeed. The issue has been addressed seriously in this debate, particularly by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has just acknowledged that there are no simple words that can be put in the Constitution to resolve the complex matter of the conflicting rights of two humans, a mother and <Col N="31" />her unborn child. It is impossible to determine an appropriate wording.</P>
      <P>Have we learnt nothing from 1983 and 1992? Do we not believe the X and C cases happened? Is it not likely that we will get it wrong for a third time? Do we have a guarantee that the proposal to be put before the people in this case is better than that in 1983 or 1992? While this House engages in a hand-wringing ritual, a Riverdance on the pure stage of holy Ireland, 7,000 people go to England to have abortions. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has rightly said, little or no attention is being given to the plight of such women. Instead, we are once more concentrating on trying to get an appropriate wording into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Has this debate made a difference to the numbers of Irish women travelling for abortions? That the estimated number of women who will travel for an abortion has increased this year, to 7,000, suggests it is obvious the debate has not had an impact. On this occasion, the people are being asked if they would like to change the 1992 decision, when a physical or mental threat to the life of a pregnant woman was considered an appropriate reason to allow a woman to choose to have an abortion. It is now proposed that the mental threat should not be considered an appropriate reason. It is considered that in 1992, an emotional reaction to a particular case made the people a little irrational. They say we may be more calm and rational on this occasion.</P>
      <P>What if there is another case, which appears to be as unlikely as the X or C cases? What if a woman says she fears she may take her own life in a moment of despair, as the circumstances of her pregnancy have made her distressed and upset? In such a scenario, the law would not allow her to consider abortion. If she attempts suicide and is brought to the accident and emergency department of her local hospital, it may be considered that her life is in physical danger. The legislation that it is proposed to include in the Constitution means that in such circumstances, she may be allowed to terminate her pregnancy. If her suicide attempt is successful, we will have failed to save her life or that of her unborn child. Such a possibility means we should think again. Should we have intervened before her distraught state led her to attempt to kill herself? I do not believe such a case is less likely than the X or C cases. If it happened after we had changed the Constitution according to these proposals, the Irish people would react, as in the X and C cases, by saying that attempts should have been made to intervene when the lives of the woman and her unborn child could have been saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this case forward as we seem to be proceeding with the view that we have got it right on this occasion. We got it wrong in 1983 and 1992, however. The issue of abortion is too complicated to put into the Constitution in this manner. If this legislation is put into the Constitution, as proposed, it is likely there will have to be another referendum in a number of years. I am alarmed <Col N="32" />to hear the concerns expressed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who is a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution, about departing from normal procedure by putting an entire Bill into the Constitution. The Deputy said that such a move is dangerous.</P>
    <P>What will happen if a psychiatrist says to his medical colleagues he believes a patient who is threatening suicide will carry out the threat? What should the psychiatrist's colleagues do? I am posing genuine questions that should be discussed before we career once more into the certainty of 1983, when we believed we had found the right way. I was involved in the 1983 campaign and I remember that those of us who opposed the amendment asked how the balance of rights between the mother and her unborn child was to be addressed. We were told that our concerns were groundless. When we continued to ask questions about the use of the morning after pill and certain methods of contraception, we were accused of wanting to kill babies. It was as simple as that in 1983 and accusations flew at the time. The very people who pushed for the amendment in 1983 decided, because of the judgments in the Supreme Court, that in fact the wording was wrong and needed to be changed. So we had the referendum in 1992 and now we propose another which will probably be held in 2002.</P>
    <P>We are again asking people to make difficult decisions in relation to the Constitution. I believe that we should legislate instead for what was decided by the people in 1992. We should address the issue of legislation seriously and should consult psychiatrists, medical people and those with strong theological beliefs and should try to get the legislation as close as possible to what the majority of Irish people want &ndash; to exclude abortion on demand. We should incorporate the views of the people in legislation rather than try again to encompass such a complex issue in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Procedures like the morning after pill and certain contraceptive methods are accepted as part of the compromise being proposed in this constitutional amendment and legislation. Since when did they become morally acceptable to those who led the campaign in 1983? Are they satisfied that this issue, which was such a fundamental moral principle in 1983, is now being dealt with by a political compromise? Some of them are not. I refer in particular to Nora Bennis, a woman in my constituency who has campaigned with clarity and consistency on this issue. She has declared publicly that she is against the proposed amendment to the Constitution because she believes that human life begins at conception. She believes the morning after pill causes abortion to which she is absolutely opposed in all circumstances. I respect that position.</P>
    <P>To be honest, I am not quite sure when human life begins, whether it is at conception or at implantation. I am not a scientist and I have no moral certainty with regard to the issue. I understand that some people do and, as Deputy <Col N="33" />O'Keeffe said, all those who sent us those postcards apparently have moral certainty on the issue. The Government proposals do not encompass the sincerely held views of those people or those of someone like Nora Bennis. Neither do they encompass the views of Deputy Neville and others concerned by the trivialisation of suicide in this debate.</P>
    <P>These proposals are a political compromise designed to get the Government off the hook of a promise it should not have made. Suicide is an issue that needs to be addressed seriously. We cannot simply dismiss the issue of suicide with regard to a pregnant woman because people can quote statistics which show a pregnant woman is less likely to commit suicide than a woman in other circumstances. Of course that is true. Most women are delighted to be pregnant and look forward to the birth of a child with pleasure and experience the first movement of life in their womb as probably one of the most extraordinary, positive experiences of their lives. However, for a small number of women it is life threatening. We should address this issue in legislation and have proper debate on the use and wording of that legislation in order to address the people's concerns that there could be a loophole for, as the Minister described it, social abortion.</P>
    <P>I do not know what social abortion is but I genuinely respect the view of people who feel that a threat of suicide could be used by somebody who just wanted an abortion for a reason the majority of Irish people would feel inappropriate. Surely we can find wording in legislation that will address that issue. We can take the issue of suicide seriously enough not to completely reject the possibility that a distraught pregnant woman might consider it and might succeed. The case I referred to earlier is a genuinely possible case in the circumstances in which abortion is discussed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of our problems is that we discuss the issue in these almost abstract terms in the House but we are dealing with 7,000 women who actually decide that they are going to have this procedure carried out. These women live in the same towns and villages as ourselves and we know them, even if we are not aware they have had an abortion. Their motivation varies but in some cases it has probably to do with the terror of having to tell their nearest and dearest that they are pregnant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are setting up a pregnancy agency which will address this issue. This is positive and we should discuss how it will work and how it will reach women who do not go to existing bodies such as family planning clinics, CURA, etc. There are concerns about addressing this issue and about getting to the women likely to take such a decision. Many women probably take it because of immaturity. They do not know what to do and have no concept of what it is about. Their immediate reaction is to get rid of the problem. This agency is what we should be providing and is the positive side of what is being <Col N="34" />proposed but we do not need a constitutional referendum to do this. This could have been done in the last four and a half years during the lifetime of the Government. It should have been done long before now.</P>
    <P>We could use legislation to address the threat to the life of the mother but what we have in these proposals is essentially a piece of political expediency. We are trying to address an issue that is not appropriate to the Constitution. We should amend the Constitution but in other ways and in order to make a real difference. Instead of this proposed amendment we should use the time and energy being put into this to address issues that will make a real difference. This will not make any difference for the women who go to England and have abortions.</P>
    <P>There are citizens in this country whose constitutional protection is less than that of their fellow citizens. They are people with disabilities, the homeless and people without access to basic social and economic rights. These issues should be addressed by way of constitutional amendment and that would make a real difference to people's lives. As it is, we are again on the once a decade round of trying to include in the Constitution wording that will protect the rights of the unborn and the rights of the woman. One of those lives is dependent on the other before the child is born.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government not to proceed with this method of dealing with the issue. Instead we should draft agreed legislation in consultation with those with opinions and expertise in this regard. I would include the psychiatric side of the medical profession in that. We should proceed with the agency; this move is welcome. I welcome also the fact that health boards are finally coming to terms with the fact that they have an obligation to women who have had abortions. In the last couple of weeks the health board in my own area organised an information meeting for GPs on post abortion counselling and treatment. This positive step will help us avoid the situation, as outlined by Deputy McManus, where Irish women are put on antibiotics when they have abortions in England because it is assumed that they will not go back to their GPs. That is also a positive step.</P>
    <P>We must deal with reality and we should have dealt with it a long time ago. If we had done so we would not see large numbers of women going to Britain for abortions. If people felt they could talk about this issue, we would not have large numbers of scared women crossing to England for abortion. A certain number of women will continue to take that option. In accepting the right to travel and information the Government and others acknowledge this. In taking a high moral ground approach instead of dealing with the real issue we will keep it underground and will never discuss the real issues which make women take this option.</P>
    <P>We are about to put the Irish people into the impossible situation of trying to decide what is <Col N="35" />appropriate to the Constitution in order to balance these rights. We should move on from 1992 and legislate appropriately for the decision taken by the Irish people at that time. Above all, we should address the real lives of women who take the decision to have an abortion and the very high abortion rate among Irish people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will reconsider its decision. It may well lose the referendum because the Government proposal is a political compromise. There are more appropriate, more humane and more effective ways of dealing with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sensitive question and not an easy one for any Member of this House to address. The question of whether the Government may lose this referendum was raised a moment ago. Of course, it is not a matter of the Government losing the referendum or not. The people will have to make up their own minds on this question.</P>
      <P>How do we proceed to make a decision on this question? Many citizens of this country were unhappy about being consulted on this matter in 1983 but they were consulted and they made a decision. As a result of that, any further approach we wish to take on the substantive issue which was discussed in the 1983 referendum campaign and by the Supreme Court in the X case must be submitted to the people for their decision. It is not politically practicable in this State to make any progress in one direction or the other without a referendum.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the position the Labour Party canvassed at the hearings conducted by the all-party committee. That party's position has been consistent. It wishes to see legislation to implement the various aspects of the X case and to give concrete shape to it. However, when that option was canvassed at the all-party committee it did not find favour with either of the two major parties. The first approach penned by the Fine Gael Party indicated that that party does not favour such legislation. It took the view that the judgment involved in deciding whether a particular threat of suicide is real is a subjective one, that Irish medical personnel had not acted on the two judgments made by the courts in this area and showed no disposition to do so in the future. When the Labour Party option was canvassed at the all-party committee neither of the major parties supported it. I accept that the Labour Party position on this issue is a valid, political one. It is a compromise position between those who expressed a particular view at the Labour Party conference and those with a different view within the party. This is an issue which divides members of all political parties. Ultimately, the political parties will have to stand back from this debate and let the people decide the question on the basis of information submitted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one likes being asked the question but I cannot see how we can resolve a difficult philosophical question such as this without submitting <Col N="36" />it to the will of the people. There are those who have argued that it should be a right of choice for a woman to decide this question and there are those who argue, on the other hand, that unborn life is worthy of legal and constitutional protection and of moral respect. Between those positions it is very difficult to make a judgment and I do not know how parliamentarians can provide for legislation. We can, as the Minister has sought to do, remove the matter from vague constitutional formulae and try to find a workable legal solution in practical statutory terms. That is what this proposal entails. I welcome that aspect of the proposal. It is legislative in form.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the understandable reservations that have been expressed about the mode of enactment of this proposal. It is proposed that the people will empower the Oireachtas to enact legislation which has been shown to the people in advance of the referendum. In the light of my conviction that we will not make any progress with this issue unless we are up front with the people, I am happy that the Government is telling the people exactly what is on offer. A clear proposal is being submitted to the people. In 1983 and 1992 vague and general constitutional formulae were submitted to the people and there were endless arguments and public debates about what the formulae meant, might mean or would mean. That approach has not been adopted on this occasion. The Government is giving the people clear sight of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>No legal scholar or lawyer of note or repute has suggested any unconstitutionality or constitutional impropriety in the approach the Government has taken. Article 46 of the Constitution permits the people to amend their Constitution. This is a matter for the people. Some Fine Gael speakers have stressed the point that we cannot amend the Constitution in this way. In 1937 when the Constitution was brought in the same party said that Mr. de Valera did not have the right to go back to the people and get their judgment on it. This is what we are doing in this instance in the only practicable way we can do so.</P>
    <P>If we were to implement the legislation in the form in which the Labour Party seeks to have it, with the suicide risk fully written into the legislation, I do not believe the Oireachtas would be able to enact such legislation without some reference back to the people. Such legislation would not have the communal sanction that a decision of that type would require.</P>
    <P>We must learn from the experience of the United States. Different approaches were taken by different states of the United States on this question. The matter fell to be decided by the Supreme Court in the famous decision of Roe and Wade, when the United States Supreme Court decided, as a matter of constitutional law, that within the United States abortion facilities should be provided on a graded basis with abortion on request in the first trimester of pregnancy and a more restricted regime for the second trimester. That decision has caused immense political <Col N="37" />controversy in the United States. It has led to the politicisation of appointments to the judiciary and has never commanded the respect of the people of America. At each presidential election the issue comes up again and again. The reason for this is that the decision was not taken by the American people but by judges. People are unhappy with the idea of such a fundamental matter of life and death being decided by the courts without reference to the people.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in the X case rightly criticised legislators for failing in our obligation to legislate. If we do not legislate it is inevitable that the courts will do so. It is not desirable, either for the courts or for our political system, that the courts are left in the position of having to legislate. Dr. T. K. Whitaker addressed this very issue before the all-party committee. It was put to him very strongly by the Fine Gael members that it should suffice to establish some form of agency and tackle the real problem of the large number of crisis pregnancies. I accept the real problem is the high number of crisis pregnancies, although no woman who had been through that experience appeared before the all-party committee and said she would like abortion facilities to be provided in the State. However, the committee had the benefit of the Trinity College study, referred to in this debate.</P>
    <P>T. K. Whitaker was asked if a package to tackle the problem of crisis pregnancy would be adequate but he took the view that it would be an evasion of responsibility in that it would mean leaving to the courts awkward decisions, such as the X case. The public was not happy with that decision. The responsibility of Parliament is to set out the guidelines of laws as clearly as they can and not to leave deliberately to the courts the settlement of obscurities. That is what we will do if we do not legislate in this matter. By adopting the legislative approach I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken the opportunity to remove a number of obscurities.</P>
    <P>One matter raised by many speakers is the question of when life begins. The legislation does not address that matter. It addresses the question of when the crime of abortion is committed. The questions raised by some speakers regarding<i> in vitro</i> fertilisation are being looked at by a separate commission dealing with assisted human reproduction. That issue must be looked at. I thank my colleagues from all parties for their magnificent work on the all party committee and I hope this commission will approach its work in a similar way and try to lay the foundation of a balanced debate. No decisions on that issue are being made in this legislation, which deals with another issue.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with those who ask if it would be possible to repeal the provision inserted in the Constitution in 1983 and start again. That is not possible. We must deal with the current situation and decide on the best practicable solution. If the people decide not to favour this measure it may be because, as in 1992, a combi<Col N="38" />nation from both sides find the proposal unacceptable. However, I believe they will look on this proposal with care because it has been drafted with considerable care and is based on an extensive period of consultation conducted by the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>I accept that when inferences are drawn from evidence many different conclusion can be reached. However, it is important that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which was of considerable help to the all-party committee, has written an open letter to the Minister confirming its support for the Bill and wishing the Government every success in the implementation of the measure. The institute did not work with the interdepartmental committee which prepared the Green Paper but in evidence to the all-party committee, a number of witnesses from the institute, representing a spectrum of opinion, established in an authoritative way contemporary practices and perceptions. Medical and clinical practice can be a dynamic, evolving practice and is not necessarily fixed or rigid in its implications. The institute is satisfied the legislation meets its concerns.</P>
    <P>Understandable concern has been expressed about the question of the suicide risk. In assessing evidence, different conclusions can be reached but an indisputable fact from the hearings we conducted is that no abortion, termination or procedure on that ground has ever been carried out in this jurisdiction. I do not want to beg the choice of words on this subject because words themselves can be lethal. As chairman of the all-party committee I was struck by the extent to which they can have an ideological rather than a practical significance. In view of this it is necessary to put side by side with the fears expressed, past practice and what doctors want to do in the future. This must be built in to current medical practice and that is the perception of the medical profession. Its endorsement of this proposal means we must consider it with great care.</P>
    <P>The one great practical merit in the legislative approach is that it puts the question of the protection of the expectant mother in a maternity hospital beyond any legal doubt whatsoever. When we conducted our hearings there were considerable doubts about the precise legal position. There was a conflict between the guidelines outlined by the Medical Council, the constitutional position outlined in the X case and the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, the basic statutory provision under which we operate. The effect of the Government's proposals is to draw together all these elements.</P>
    <P>The great merit of having a statutory position is that the legislation is laid out in black and white in accordance with the well established schemes of statutory construction and interpretation. We are not leaving the matter open, as would a constitutional formula, to vague general interpretation in the courts. A precise guideline is being laid down, which will benefit all concerned.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that while we may <Col N="39" />settle that issue we are far from settling the far wider, deeper, human and emotional tragedy involved. The Government and all of the parties on the all-party committee pressed strongly for the establishment of an agency that would look at this problem in a realistic way, would take the subject of sexuality in Ireland away from the bar counter and the casual joke and consider it in a modern context to see how the issues of education, counselling, including counselling those who have had abortions, prevention, abstention, contraception and care could be drawn together in a compassionate, sympathetic and tolerant approach that would state where we stand today on all these issues. I welcome the fact that the Government has established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the impressive membership appointed to it. It is important for the agency to commence work. This Bill contains a precise proposal on which the people will have to decide but it is being submitted to them in the context of the establishment of an agency which looks at documents such as the Trinity College study and surveys, many of which have been haphazard in their approach and not fully thought out in terms of orientation and where they should be going. It will examine the problem as it stands and see what can be done about it. That is a practical way of making some progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>On the wider constitutional issue posed by the legislation, there is no constitutional difficulty with the particular mode of enactment. Article 46 of the Constitution provides that a Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of the Constitution shall not contain any other proposal but I am satisfied this is not another proposal because it is open to the Oireachtas to enact this legislation afterwards. There is ample authority that the courts do not interfere with the sovereign right of the people to decide what should be in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This proposal has been thought through and the Government has carefully examined the report of the all-party committee. Different people have very different perceptions of this issue, but far from this being unique to Ireland, similar debates have taken place in other countries. Likewise, it will be asked why so many people travel to England and whether we are being hypocritical and failing to face up to our responsibilities. However, another feature of the abortion debate around the world is that there are many jurisdictions to and from which people come and go to avail of particular services. The UK has one of the most liberal abortion regimes in the world and we are in close proximity to it. I do not believe any abortion law ideally devised in the House would ever meet the requirement of those who seek to avail of services in England as the services there, as in some other jurisdictions, are available on a very liberal scale. There are many other European jurisdictions where there are regular movements of people and recourse to facilities available in other countries. Equally, it is <Col N="40" />clear that those countries which have introduced liberal, widely available abortion have had huge controversies within their medical profession and among the public regarding the morality of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult question and parties will have to draw back a bit from the debate. I welcome the fact this has, by and large, been the tone of the debate in the House and in the all-party committee. In terms of legislation on sexuality we have made fools of ourselves many times through the years, including on censorship, contraception and abortion, and I hope on this occasion we can conduct the debate in a civilised way, look at ourselves as a people and see if we can make a decision which addresses at least some of the problems we face on this issue. It is never possible to find an ideal solution to this problem. This can be one of the difficulties with the motivation of many who argue the points, but the Government has arrived at a conclusion on the matter and has submitted proposals to the people which are worthy of very serious consideration and give the people a real chance to find a workable solution to this problem for this generation at least.</P>

      <P>The most common reaction of many people to this issue is &ldquo;Not again&rdquo;. It seems we have debated this issue <i>ad nauseam</i> for the past two decades or longer. It has scarred the national consciousness and left a legacy of bitterness and a gulf of misunderstanding. This legislation tries to bring together the divergent views, but in its attempt to be all things to all people, it ends up being nothing to anyone. For that reason the consensus so sought after by the Government will not occur and the referendum will most likely fail.</P>
      <P>My party allows each individual make up his or her mind on matters of conscience, as this matter clearly is. As it happens, both Green Party Deputies will be opposing the legislation on a number of grounds which I will outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I heard some speakers refer to this as a pro-life amendment or pro-life legislation. However, it is not. Many pro-life individuals have written to Members of the House expressing their sincere reservations about the legislation. They are correct as the legislation enshrines in law the notion that life begins at implantation and not at conception. Therefore, it clearly legalises the taking of unborn life in its very early stages. I am not a theological expert, but I believe this contravenes Catholic teaching and it is anathema to many in the pro-life movement who believe the morning after pill is morally wrong. The Government knows the morning after pill is widely and increasingly used in this country. It knows that if it was not used the number of abortions by Irish women in Britain would be far higher, and the Government has been forced to recognise this reality. It has been forced to recognise the reality that women require information and the right to travel and it has abandoned the core principle of <Col N="41" />the pro-life movement that life begins at conception.</P>
    <P>The most pertinent legal and moral question which arises is that if it is acceptable to take unborn life by way of the morning after pill, why it is not acceptable to take unborn life by way of direct abortion. Surely this glaring inconsistency has not escaped the minds of those who worked on these proposals. The legislation is a political and moral fig leaf. It hopes to preserve our purity by bending morality. We can still technically say there is no abortion in Ireland, but that hides the sad reality.</P>
    <P>We are of the view that this proposed amendment to the Constitution will not address a number of fundamental questions. Will the referendum make the situation regarding abortion any clearer legally? After reviewing the proposals I must answer &ldquo;No&rdquo;. If anything, it will make the legal situation worse. Will it help women who are suicidal, women who have been raped, or women who are victims of incest? Again, I do not believe it will.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has admitted that the referendum route we are being presented with is only constitutionally necessary to overthrow the Supreme Court decision in the X case and that it is not necessary for implementing any of the other aspects, which can be implemented through legislation. Therefore, we continue to legalise the abortion trail to Britain so we can feel good about ourselves. We are now being subjected to what in all probability will be a divisive and painful abortion referendum, necessitated solely by the Government's insistence on reversing the Supreme Court's ruling on suicide and abortion. If this referendum is passed a suicidal woman who chooses abortion will be criminalised, and we find this totally inhumane and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The referendum will create a great deal of wealth for lawyers, but many headaches for the rest of us. It is a legal mess. Before it was out of the stalls, reports of the legal time bombs being lobbed at voters were surfacing in the media, with quotes from constitutional and legal experts. The very process of introducing such a Bill, amending the Constitution in such a manner, and appending an Act to the Constitution as a Schedule, is quite extraordinary. It will mean it will not be possible to amend the legislation at a later stage in the Dáil, even though the courts could technically interpret the legislation in a manner which was not intended by ourselves or those who vote in the referendum. We would have to return to the people with yet another abortion referendum to untie any complications which might arise from the bad drafting of the current proposal.</P>
    <P>Powers are given to the Minister to determine what evidence will be necessary to ascertain whether a medical procedure or an abortion has been carried out, and he or she will have similar powers when it comes to determining the approved places where such medical procedures may be carried out. This will be done by ministerial order, and we know how little scrutiny such <Col N="42" />orders receive in the House. Nobody knows whether one hospital will be designated an approved place or whether it will extend to every doctor's surgery. The definitions are either non-existent or so broad as to invite multiple interpretations. I have already referred to the problems concerning an approved place. &ldquo;Medical procedure&rdquo;, although it is cited as being different from abortion, which is illegal, is never defined. &ldquo;Woman&rdquo;, we are helpfully told, means a female person. The definition of medical practitioner is so broad that it would allow any of us, God forbid, to set up a practice and perform medical procedures under the guidelines in the legislation. Who knows, the responsible Minister might deem Dáil Éireann an approved place.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not state that a medical practitioner must be registered with the general registrar of medical practitioners or anyone else. Irish law does not properly prohibit unregistered people from practising medicine. The Taoiseach has already admitted in his responses to Deputy Noonan that a legal challenge is also possible under Article 40.3.3 to prevent suspected abortifacients and that the society for the Protection of the Unborn Child is now pursuing a legal case in the United Kingdom to have the morning after pill banned.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other instances of lack of clarity in this proposed referendum. The last one I wish to highlight at this stage is the 17th protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and how it will sit if this referendum is approved. The 17th protocol inserted by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government stated that nothing in the treaty of the European Union shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution of Ireland. Article 40.3.3 states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>With this referendum we are inserting Article 40.3.4 and Article 40.3.5. I know the Taoiseach has stated that this envisaged legislation will have no EU law implications. I also know the Government has changed its version on this issue at least three times in the Dáil. On 9 October, for instance, the Taoiseach stated that to change the Maastricht Protocol was probably not necessary. What then is the situation? </P>
    <P>There are questions hanging over this issue in regard to the EU. There is the issue of a fundamental charter or constitution being drawn up by the European Union; there is also the issue of the EU incorporating the EU convention on human rights. I understand some of the case law built around the convention stresses the right to life of the mother as against the foetus. It stands to reason that a protocol that cites a particular Article of the Constitution only applies to that particular section. What will the Government do <Col N="43" />about this? If we are to believe the Government in regard to the changing of the Nice Treaty, it appears that it is impossible for any protocols to be added to that treaty. We are told that it is impossible for the Nice Treaty to be changed one iota. Many of the groups who campaigned against the Nice Treaty have been seeking to have a protocol attached exempting Ireland from any involvement in European Union militarisation and in the EU Rapid Reaction Force.</P>
    <P>If it is confirmed that the Maastricht Protocol will not extend to these issues addressed in the forthcoming abortion referendum, what will the Government do? I am intrigued by one of the Taoiseach's suggestions. On 9 October in the Dáil the Taoiseach stated that if a change was necessary this would not create a difficulty with member states because on a whole range of issues protocols are regularly nodded through at European Council level. I found this to be an extraordinary statement. If an abortion change can be nodded through, why can a change in Ireland's involvement in EU defence not be nodded through, as the Taoiseach puts it? Perhaps we could nod through both of them at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's analysis of this issue is totally woolly. It seems that the Government will have to wait for the next EU treaty to be drafted before any new protocols can be inserted. This will leave the legal status of the Maastrich Protocol in limbo until the next EU treaty is negotiated, in other words, for several years. This is quite a mess.</P>
    <P>The removal of the suicide clause is the only reason for the Government calling a referendum on this issue. The people already decided by way of referendum in 1992 to retain this protection but now the Government is asking them to look at it again. The Taoiseach's response to the issue of what to do when a pregnant woman is suicidal is to export that woman and her problem to another jurisdiction. What that means is that appropriate medical treatment as determined by medical doctors is not being given in this country to our citizens. It means that psychiatrists' opinions are not seen as valid. It implies that mental illness is not a real illness and that it cannot be life threatening. I understand the incidence of suicide in pregnancy is rare, as Deputy Lenihan said. However, the Supreme Court X case decision has been with us for a decade and there has been no upsurge of abortion cases citing suicide. All the more reason to wonder why are we having a referendum to deal with these rare instances. Why are we removing this small but important protection for women's lives?</P>
    <P>Like many people, I feel distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of abortion. Anyone who has attended a maternity hospital, witnessed an ultra sound scan and seen the womb will find the idea of abortion quite distasteful. We have a duty as legislators to face up to the reality. It is a terrible and sad reality but face it we must. I do not believe this legislation is doing so, therefore, we <Col N="44" />will be supporting the Fine Gael amendment and opposing the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Abortion by its nature is a highly emotive issue. I believe the Government is taking full cognisance of this fact with regard to the policy it is pursuing on abortion. Before speaking in detail about the provisions of the Bill, I would like to make a few brief comments concerning the background to the legislation.</P>
      <P>In 1983, a pro life amendment to the Constitution was enacted by a decision of the people. However, as a result of that decision, no laws were put in place to deal with the issue of abortion. That means, in effect, that the Offences Against the Persons Act which dates back to 1861 remains the basic law on abortion. Almost ten years later in 1992 the Supreme Court gave the decision in the X case. As we all recall that judgment gave rise to much emotion. Consequently, in November of that year another referendum, which incorporated three new proposals, was put to the people. One issue on the right to travel was approved by the people. Two other issues which sought to reconcile the rights of the mother and the unborn were rejected by the decision of the voters. In effect, no matter which way one looks at the issue of abortion, there is certainly a legislative vacuum.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, by way of its general election manifesto in 1997, gave a commitment to the Irish people that a pro life referendum would be held. The Government has approached this issue in a very careful and measured manner. In September 1999, a Green Paper on abortion was published by the Government. This Green Paper in turn was referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which reported in November 2000. It was at this stage that the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee to consider its options and to prepare new proposals. In effect, the Government is now seeking to add two new subsections to Article 40.3 of the Constitution. The first gives constitutional protection for the adoption by the Oireachtas of a legislative approach. This guarantees the terms of the legislation which will be seen and approved by the people in advance. The second option provides that any future legislative amendment must be approved by the people before it is signed into law by the President. Put in its simplest terms, the Government is seeking to put this issue where it belongs, which is on a legislative basis. Hence the publication of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, which is now before the House for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I would like to say that the electorate is being asked to approve a conditional amendment to the Constitution. This means, in effect, that the terms of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act will be enacted. The provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill protects the life of the unborn child. As a politician, I fully support the need to protect <Col N="45" />the life of the unborn and that is why I very much welcome the measured approach by which the Government is addressing what is clearly a complex and emotive subject.</P>
    <P>This new law will protect both women and the unborn child and will accommodate existing medical practice which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risks. The Taoiseach stated, when he launched the Government's proposals for constitutional and legislative reform on abortion, that doing nothing is not an option. He is totally correct in his approach. Doing nothing just simply means that the legal vacuum, which arguably has been in place since 1983, would remain the order of the day. This would be an unacceptable situation. The Taoiseach also stated that the legalisation of abortion is rightly not an option because the Irish people are simply against this. The Irish people have a right to be consulted on this very important issue and I hope, when an abortion referendum is held, the debate which will take place will acknowledge that the Government has carefully weighed up its options and is presenting a very balanced set of proposals to the people. The proposed amendment to the Constitution is designed to acknowledge that the abortion issue is one on which the people want to have the final decision, while, at the same time, leaving the matter primarily within the legislative arena.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's statement that the inevitable far reaching public debate on these proposals must take place in a spirit of reason, tolerance and open-mindedness. We need a debate to take place in a calm and mature way. One of the proposals which I strongly support in this Bill is the provision to set up a new statutory agency which will be called the crisis pregnancy agency. This is a recommendation which was included in the proposals brought forward by the All Party Committee on the Constitution. I congratulate Deputy Lenihan, as chairman, and all members of that committee for the time and effort which they contributed to their work. The committee proposed the establishment of such an agency to draw up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies, promote options other than abortion where a crisis pregnancy occurs and to provide for post abortion services. This agency will, in effect, draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancies. It will work with a wide range of organisations, not just in the health sector but in the employment, educational and housing sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government is allocating &euro;6.5 million for the running of this agency in the year 2002. It will be established for a period of ten years, as recommended by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Too many Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities for many aspects relating to crisis pregnancies. It is clear that better co-ordination is needed with regard to the issue of crisis pregnancy and the setting up of such a new agency would serve a very positive function. This crisis <Col N="46" />pregnancy agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated and appropriate services which will reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and give women in a very difficult situation the widest possible range of assistance to help them cope.</P>
    <P>The Government is also anxious that the law should protect best medical practice and remove any doubt about the legality of treatment which doctors may consider necessary. Section 2 states that no persons shall carry out or effect an abortion in this State. A person who contravenes this section or attempts to do so or aids or procures any other person to do so shall be guilty of an offence. Such a person may be liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 years or to a fine.</P>
    <P>This constitutional amendment and proposed legislation do not have any implications in terms of legal directives and regulations at European level. There is no aspect of European law, and no jurisdiction on the part of any of the European institutions or of the European Court of Justice, which could challenge or prevent the operation of the law envisaged by these proposals. The Government is not running away from addressing the issues connected with the need to protect the life of the unborn child. In fact, the opposite is the case. The Government has carefully measured all its options and has produced a very sensible and balanced set of proposals which will protect the life of the unborn child. The vast majority of the members of this House should support the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said recently, our basic choice is either to have a constructive debate which achieves as much agreement as possible or to allow matters to drift until the next court case forces us to confront this issue again. The Government is launching the first comprehensive national initiative to help prevent unwanted pregnancies and to support women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy. I fully support the provisions included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I support the proposed wording of the twenty-fifth amendment to the Constitution. If the wording was factual, I would have absolutely no difficulty with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. Life is sacred and the voice for the unborn must be heard. I welcome the debate in so far as it is level and very well balanced and the heat and bitterness generated in previous debates has not surfaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions to the debate this morning were excellent. I welcome the definite statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that abortion on demand will not be introduced into this country. That is a commendable and noteworthy statement. I listened with interest to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's comment that we should hasten slowly, with which I agree. I was amazed and appalled by the information given by Deputy <Col N="47" />O'Sullivan that 7,000 women sought abortion outside this country last year. That is sad and frightening. Such events are described as crisis or unplanned pregnancies, which terminology I do not understand.</P>
    <P>In querying the wording of the amendment, I pose the question: When does life begin? We are told it is at implantation &ndash; I do not understand that. It is my understanding that life begins at conception. If life does not begin at conception, what actually happens at conception? Those issues have to be addressed. It is a sad reflection on our society that so many women consider it necessary to terminate a pregnancy. I can only speak as a lay person. I have no medical or scientific qualification. I can speak as a parent and as a public representative who has dealt with people's social and personal problems for 25 years both at local authority level and at national level since I became a Deputy in 1987. There are tremendously difficult social problems and these have not improved despite the fact that the country has progressed. We have become more affluent and young people have more disposable income. However, there is a tremendous abuse of this affluence.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem of drink and drugs. Is it as a result of the abuse of drink and drugs that what are called crisis or unplanned pregnancies come about? I believe it is related and therefore we must address that issue. We must help young people to understand. The facts of life are well known now, certainly much more than was the case decades ago. Young people clearly understand the activity in which they are getting involved. However, much of this comes about because of an abuse of their social lives, which is sad. I am aware that 80% to 90% of our young people are marvellous, well-mannered and good living people. However, there are others that do not appear capable of behaving in a proper manner that would give them a better life without any of these problems.</P>
    <P>At my clinic and my home, young pregnant girls of 15, 16 or 17 have come to me. They are afraid to tell their parents or seek help. On one occasion a teacher came to me asking how she should address the problem relating to a pupil in her leaving certificate class. Such a problem causes turmoil in that young person's mind and creates a huge upheaval in her life. The first requirement is to have support services and somebody to whom that person can turn. She needs help through the health boards, local health authorities and local community workers. There are many people willing to help but certainly abortion is not the answer for that girl's problem.</P>
    <P>Abortion is wrong, full stop. It is wrong here and it is not acceptable for women to go abroad for abortions. It is wrong here; it is wrong in Britain, where apparently it is freely available and it is wrong in any European country. We cannot export our problems. People talk about an Irish <Col N="48" />solution to an Irish problem. Well, we have an Irish problem.</P>
    <P>On Monday night, I attended the launch of a card to verify the age of young people to help prevent people selling alcohol to under age drinkers. This is being promoted by the Garda Síochána and the liaison officers. That is a marvellous development. It is an indication of the concern people have about what is happening in society that we had over 150 people from different public bodies, health bodies, community councils and community workers attending that meeting to see how they could help. They also recognise there is a problem in our society. If we approach it from that angle, the number of young girls becoming pregnant could be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>There are cases of older women who want to terminate pregnancies claiming they will commit suicide otherwise. I am aware of families where suicide has occurred. They are often traumatised and particularly bewildered that the victim gave no indication of being ill. People do not go around saying they are going to commit suicide and then carry it out. However, a person threatening suicide if she does not get an abortion or if something does not happen for her is crying for help. That help and support must be available.</P>
    <P>There are many couples that have no family and are only too willing to adopt a baby. There are other people who may have raised a family already and are willing to foster a baby. Help is available but obviously these people are not aware of it. They must be made aware of it. Contact numbers for crisis pregnancy agencies are available at public clinics and other centres, but obviously that is not sufficient and they are not getting to the people with the problem. I do not accept the threat of suicide as a reason for allowing a woman to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>I can cite the case of a boy of 18 who took his father's car without permission and went to see his girl friend. They went for a drive, had a crash and the wee girl was killed. That young boy was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, which he is now serving. He is anxious to do so in order to try to repay his debt to the family of the girl and to society. What is the difference between the death in that case and an abortion?</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to help these people. We are wrong to think we will solve the problem by stating that life does not begin until some date after implantation and conception. Cases of rape occur and it is a terrible indictment on our society that there are brutes that are prepared to abuse a young girl or woman in this manner, either individually or in gangs. Where that happens, the victim should immediately seek help from the authorities as well as medical help. I mean that she should get to her doctor or to a hospital immediately. I cannot accept the argument that a woman can claim two months later that she was raped. This does happen and although thankfully it is <Col N="49" />not widespread, there have been horrific incidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Nally report contained two recommendations relating to the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office. One recommended that, subject to agreement on adequate staffing levels and appropriate staff structures, the criminal division of the CSSO should be transferred to the DPP's office to form a unit headed by a solicitor to the DPP, with statutory clarification that its professional staff would be professional staff of the DPP within the meaning of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974. The second recommended that responsibility for the State solicitors should be transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP, with legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate to them. Arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are at an advanced stage. As I mentioned in earlier replies, an appointment to the post of Chief Prosecution Solicitor to the DPP was made some time ago. An agreement with the union representing professional and technical staff was concluded in May of this year and discussions with the clerical union have now been finalised. The personnel changes required to establish a separate Office of Chief Prosecution Solicitor to the DPP are being put in train. Formal transfer of responsibility is now imminent. The transfer of responsibility for the State solicitor service has been under consideration and a discussion process with the State Solicitors' Association is being established. Any formal transfer must await the outcome of that discussion process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>Staff shortages have caused ongoing problems for the efficient operation of the State Solicitor's office. When the Taoiseach last answered questions on this topic he indicated <Col N="50" />that there were 40 unfilled vacancies. Have those been filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main features in the package agreed were an increase of 75 staff, including 66 in the professional and technical staff complements. A number of the positions have been filled, but not all. Under the new package there is agreement on salary terms, the recruitment campaign, confined competitions, filling promotions from outside the office and co-operation on the implementation of the Nally report. There is a new recruitment grade in place for solicitors, 52 additional professional staff &ndash; including 12 posts of senior solicitor &ndash; will be appointed. A number of these positions have been filled while advertising and competitions are ongoing for the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach evaluating the improvement as a result of the implementation of the Nally report? What system of measurement is being used? Will the Taoiseach report on any improvements or are the delays in the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the DPP as bad as ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the system has had a number of improvements in the past four or five years. This latest package, which was holding up the implementation of the Nally report, has certainly helped. An evaluation and implementation group is overseeing the changes and the work involved in it. The new office of the Chief State Solicitor and the DPP is in place. Premises have been obtained on Abbey Street and are expected to be ready for occupation in January. The long-term plan is to house all the DPP's staff in one premises. The introduction of office-wide IT systems, a new organisational structure, additional staffing and provision of a modern library have helped with efficiencies in the offices. The new staff is fully in place and agreement on the union management negotiations should help ongoing work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave a not dissimilar reply to this series of questions on 30 May regarding the agreement that had been achieved with the unions and a promise of the implementation of the agreement due for later that month. The reply indicated that the accommodation needs were already satisfied. In the light of the ongoing issues, which I fully acknowledge are difficult and complicated, when is it envisaged the full terms and recommendations of the Nally report will be implemented? When will the transfer of function from the Chief State Solicitor's office to implement the State Claims Agency &ndash; which I understand will be under the office of the National Treasury Management Agency &ndash; take place? Is that part of the reform package the Taoiseach is trying to overview?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is going ahead and there is separate legislation for it. Most, but not all, of the items identified by the study group as being required were taken on board. Two ends of the negotiations were tied down in May, the first was with the solicitors and members of IMPACT and the other &ndash; which is being finalised now &ndash; was with the clerical staff. Other aspects included office management procedures, IT, the library and others and they have now been completed. The solicitor and his staff are in place. I am not suggesting everything is totally in order, it will take some time to bed down all of this. The difficulties which delayed this for a considerable time have been overcome. I record my thanks to everybody involved in this from both the management and staff sides. There were many changes. It is moving well and hopefully the remaining professional staff &ndash; who are the most difficult to recruit &ndash; will be attracted. The new recruitment scale amalgamates the two lower solicitor grades. It gives qualified solicitors a far better starting salary and a better incremental scale. I hope that will resolve that problem. The scale runs from approximately £24,000 to £40,000 in a six year period.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions have not yet been made but they are at an advanced stage. The chief prosecution solicitor to the DPP's office, who will formally take over these powers under the 1974 legislation, has been in place for several months. The formal orders have not yet been brought to me but all the work is going ahead. I understand the orders should be with me shortly. The reason for the delay is the office did not want to make the orders until all the structures were in place.</P>

      <P>I welcome the progress to which the Taoiseach alluded. At the end of the day the improvements will only be measured by way of greater efficiency and shorter times in terms of dealing with matters of public importance. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on pay arrangements? The new offices will only be successful if there are sufficient recruits to take up positions. The rate of public sector pay <i>vis-á-vis</i> private sector pay is one of the greatest incentives. Have the pay negotiations been completed to the satisfaction of all concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the pay agreement with the staff side has been concluded and the agreement also covered conditions, the location of staff and a range of other issues. The pay agreement for professional and technical staff has been concluded and has been backdated to 1 April 2000. That was subject to the staff agreeing to co-operate fully with the implementation of the Nally report and the acceptance and operation by the staff of the new work practices. Deputies Noonan and Flanagan both asked about the efficiency of the procedures in the office relating to IT and IT-linked work management systems.</P>
      <P>The pay structures have been resolved. There has been recruitment at the higher level of legal clerk rather than law clerk on the technical side. Deputy Howlin referred to my statement in the House in May. Fourteen extra technical staff have been appointed with nine senior positions created and the current grades of legal clerk, senior legal clerk, legal staff officer have been amalgamated into two grades of staff officer and higher executive officer. There are also new opportunities for support and technical staff.</P>
      <P>As a result there is a cadre of staff who can transfer within the various legal offices of the State. The benefit for them is there are more promotional outlets and they can move around the system rather than being stuck in one area and that is better. It is a substantial package which allows the Nally recommendations and other work on efficiency to proceed.</P>

      <P>I have no information on that but I will ask the Attorney General to raise the matter at his meetings. These significant extra resources and staff complement the considerable work that was begun by former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson. Significant resources have been invested to overhaul the office over the past six years under three Attorneys General, Gleeson, Byrne and McDowell. I hope the end result of the collective work which has been supported with a great deal of resources from the State is a far better service.</P>

      <P>I chair Cabinet sub-committees on asylum seekers, children, European affairs, housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, social inclusion and the information society. The Government has also established a sub-committee to oversee the management of the legal action concerning the Sellafield MOX plant.</P>
      <P>As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, most recently on 15 May, Cabinet sub-committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet sub-committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality. As always, questions on particular policy issues should be put down to relevant Ministers.</P>

      <P>With regard to my question, how many times has the sub-committee on social inclusion met this session? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that in terms of social exclusion the gap between the haves and the rest in these areas has widened? Does he agree that, notwithstanding the good work that has been done on the drugs issues, it is still regrettable that many young people in need of treatment cannot get a place on a programme? Do the terms of reference of the sub-committee take into account the policing of the areas worst affected by social exclusion? There is not adequate policing in many of these areas, crime is going unreported and undetected and this is having a serious injurious effect on the quality of life of many of our citizens living in these areas.</P>

      <P>You assume correctly, Ceann Comhairle. My Question No. 6 asks for a report on progress of the newly formed Cabinet sub-committee on Sellafield, or, as the Taoiseach says, on the MOX plant. I know the Taoiseach is interested in this. I could hear him shouting from Citywest from as far away as Balbriggan. The question is whether he is heard across the Irish Sea. Is the committee dealing in totality with the issues to do with Sellafield? The STAD case being taken by Dundalk residents will be an important precedent for any future legal action. This case has not been well-supported from their point of view and the Taoiseach may have been made aware of this by his colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Is the committee looking at the EURATOM treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Law of the Sea and OSPAR as a basis on which to take legal action? </P>

      <P>In relation to the chairing of the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure and notwithstanding what you said earlier, Ceann Comhairle, regarding a difficulty on the part of the Taoiseach to deal with matters that are under discussion or have been discussed, may I ask in relation to decisions made, does the Taoiseach accept that the current log jam and bottleneck in our economy as far as infrastructural deficit is <Col N="58" />concerned, is giving rise to difficulties on the part of industry in ensuring that we maintain competitiveness? Last Sunday his Minister for Finance stated that certain aspects of the national development plan will not now proceed. Will the Taoiseach agree that this has given rise to even greater uncertainty in business and enterprise? There is now a feeling that there will be a certain amount of reneging on fundamental aspects of the national development plan. Is the Taoiseach in a position to clarify matters for the benefit of the House this afternoon? This is the first opportunity we have had since the Minister's statement and having regard to the rules of the House. If parliament is not allowed to ask questions of a fundamental nature, when will the Taoiseach as head of Government and as chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure make a statement clarifying what is proceeding under the national development plan as far as infrastructure is concerned and what aspects of the plan have been scrapped? </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement placed a formal commitment on the Government &ldquo;to continue to take further steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. It was against this background, therefore, and immediately after the establishment of the institutions on 2 December 1999, that on 5 December 1999 I announced that the Government had agreed in principle to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne.</P>
      <P>In January 1998 an interdepartmental committee was established to examine how best to develop the historic site of the Battle of the Boyne. The committee, which is chaired by a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs, has met on a regular basis for the past three years. My Department is represented on the committee at assistant principal level.</P>
      <P>The House considered this issue in considerable detail on 1 May last and, as I indicated to the House in my reply at that time, the Office of Public Works negotiated the purchase of the Oldbridge Estate and funding for the purchase came from the Exchequer through the Vote of the Office of Public Works, following sanction by the Department of Finance. Neither I nor my officials played any part in the negotiations on the purchase of the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been over this ground before. When the Taoiseach answered questions on this matter on 1 May last he categorically <Col N="61" />assured me that he had not requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include this project in the Government's millennium programme. However, material subsequently obtained by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> included a letter from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 August 1998 suggesting that they both meet with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, with a view to discussing how the project might fit into the millennium programme. Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to correct the record of the House and state now that the information he gave to me on 1 May last was incorrect? A submission was made by the Taoiseach regarding approaching two Ministers to ensure this project was included in the millennium programme.</P>

If it was recommended to me that I request people to do that, I obviously did it. If it came out in a freedom of information request, that is obviously the case. As far as I know, that money, which is for some of the preliminary works on the site of the Battle of the Boyne, has not yet been drawn down.</P>

However, it transpired under the Freedom of Information Act request that he made a submission. The Taoiseach should correct the record of the House instead of saying &ldquo;If that is the case, that is the case&rdquo;. He should make a straight statement on the record of the House setting out the position.

      <P>Whatever the freedom of information request states, that definitely is not the case. This matter was brought to the Cabinet and I recall reading a memorandum about it. It was supported by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. All the work was done by the Office of Public Works. It issued a report to my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Regardless of what might have happened at official level, the entire purchase was handled by a senior commissioner of the Office of Public Works. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands was involved in the historical aspects with regard to Government meetings and the Department of Foreign Affairs brought forward a memorandum. There was no objection by the Minister.</P>

Is the Taoiseach confirming that he had no discussions with Office of Public Works officials or anybody else in relation to the purchase of this site? In relation to the mechanism used to acquire the site, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, published in September this year, states that the mechanism for acquiring the lands through the purchase of the company was chosen at the behest of the company shareholders, resulting in a tax saving of an estimated £920,000. Why did the Office of Public Works use this mechanism? Has the Taoiseach queried this since the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General? </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My adviser reported to me and the interdepartmental committee and I was certainly aware of his work on North-South matters. <Col N="63" />Deputy Noonan's earlier question suggested we should also consider millennium funds in this regard. Clearly if I signed the letter, I signed the letter.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works dealt with the purchase of this site. While I was not personally involved, one of my advisers would have had some discussions on the development of the site, prior to its sale and following its sale although he was not involved in its purchase. He still takes an interest in this matter which since January 1998 has been dealt with by the interdepartmental committee which is still in place. The original idea about this site did not originate from my Department, rather from civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs with whom it was raised by the Northern authorities. I outlined previously the groups involved &ndash; the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys, Archbishop Eames etc.</P>
      <P>On the issue of how the sale was dealt with and the tax aspects thereof, I did not have any involvement in this area which was a matter for the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works. These issues, with which I am not particularly familiar, were addressed, clarified and supported in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee on which the Taoiseach's adviser sat presumably discussed the acquisition of the site and the mechanisms to be used in its acquisition. Is the Taoiseach saying that neither his adviser nor any other member of the committee reported to him on the mechanism for acquisition, the beneficial ownership of the site or any matters relating to costings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I appear to be talking about two different people. My Department is represented on the committee at assistant principal level. I did not have any discussions whatsoever with the departmental official who sits on the committee. My adviser, who is not a member of the committee but has a particular interest in this site, particularly its North-South aspects, advised me throughout the process but did not play any part in the terms of the purchase price or any other details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to my knowledge. The matter was dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, and the company of solicitors acting for the vendors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The vendors of this site made a profit of approximately £5 million. The Taoiseach stated previously that he thought the site was good value for the taxpayer although some <Col N="64" />people may take a different view. Even though the Taoiseach has always stated the site's purchase arose from the Good Friday Agreement and was part of the programme to establish good cross-Border relations, strong claims are made that this site was being considered for purchase well in advance of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. It is also claimed this site was being considered for purchase well in advance of the purchase of the site by the consortium which profited from its sale to the State. Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee was established by officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs at the beginning of 1998. I understand they issued a statement on 8 January 1998 because the matter had certainly been raised with them in the preceding months. Archbishop Eames raised the matter with the Department directly in October-November 1997 during the multi-party talks. I also understand the site, which is the subject of one of the tribunals, was raised over many years by a number of historical groups, although when I asked for correspondence on this matter, none was available. I am, however, informed that historical groups in the North and in the Meath-Louth area were interested in the site.</P>
      <P>The press statement issued by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in January 1998 did not refer to the possible purchase of the site. Following from what happened on the site at Messines and what was happening in relation to the commemoration of the 1798 Rebellion, it was felt the site would constitute another means of fostering peace and reconciliation and good North-South relations because of its historical importance. A great deal of correspondence on its historical importance is in the public domain following FOI requests. The Department of Foreign Affairs was at that stage examining the possibility of improving the site, building offices on it, conducting tours etc. It was not until later that year, towards the very end of 1998, that the solicitors for the owners who purchased the site in 1997 indicated their willingness to sell the site. Negotiations commenced at that stage. My Department was approached in the first instance as there was an awareness that one of my advisers had a historical interest in the matter and the issue was subsequently referred to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Foreign Affairs. All of this information, which is on file, has been forwarded to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am simply asking whether the Taoiseach can see the implications of a situation in which the purchase of the site was being discussed far in advance of the Good Friday Agreement and in advance of its purchase by the vendors. Does the Taoiseach understand the suggestion that those who bought the site did so in anticipation of its being sold on to the State, from which they subsequently made a profit of £5 million? It is unfortunate that one of the people involved was an adviser in the Taoiseach's Department. That, in a nutshell, is the nub of the problem. Will the Taoiseach address this issue before we leave the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to do so. I understand the site, which was sold on a number of occasions by previous owners, was bought in 1997 although I am not sure of the precise date. The Department of Foreign Affairs issued its first statement on 8 January 1998, which statement did not refer to the purchase of the site. It was at the end of 1998 that solicitors representing the owners of the site came forward to state that this site of historical value could be bought. I accept that the Deputy is not making any allegations and that he raised this matter in a fair manner. Those who bring up this matter are adding one and one to get 11 just because I know somebody who worked for the company that ultimately bought the site. I am aware that is the issue and I am glad that it is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on the record once more that I had no knowledge of what was happening to the site until my adviser brought it to my attention that the solicitor representing the owners wished to engage with the State. I had no part in the sale as the matter was referred to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Foreign Affairs. The record and the officials concerned will show that I was not very enthusiastic about the issue, but another forum will look ultimately at that. I appreciate that Deputy Noonan is showing concern, but he has raised the question of my involvement and that of those for whom I am responsible. I had very little involvement and the involvement of others commenced after the sale of the site. I did not know at the time that somebody I have known quite well for many years was associated with the owners of the site. It was with some shock that I discovered much later this man's involvement because I understand how these matters operate.</P>

It is overseen by an advisory board which includes representatives of the organisation Victim Support, the TVSS full-time co-ordinator, Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism, Dublin Corporation, the Irish Hotels Federation, Aer Rianta, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other partners in the tourism sector. The service receives an annual grant of £15,000 from Bord Fáilte and not directly from my Department. I can confirm that TVSS forwarded an application for increased funding to me last August, which was duly forwarded for consideration to Bord Fáilte, which is currently in discussion with the TVSS.</P>
      <P>The TVSS offers a service to tourists who are attacked, robbed or otherwise victimised while visiting Ireland. Over 3,000 cases have been referred to it since its establishment in 1994 and I welcome the gradual but steady reduction in the number of referrals since 1999. Larceny and theft from cars still account for the majority of the crimes against tourists. Violent attacks, although still occurring, are decreasing. I was particularly heartened to hear of the overwhelming support for Guido Nasi, who was attacked in Fairview Park two years ago and who returned to Ireland for a visit this year. This support shows that Irish people have a particular aversion to attacks against tourists, who are our guests, and are determined to make every effort to counter crime against tourists.</P>
      <P>It is our duty to make our visitors feel welcome and safe in our country. The Government is playing a part in relation to general security issues and I am aware that a number of organisations, in addition to Bord Fáilte, also make contributions to the TVSS. A concerted effort to increase sponsorship is being made by the TVSS. I call on the many tourism enterprises who avail of or have access to the referral service to consider making a contribution to the funding of its activities.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister agree that £15,000 for the material and emotional support the TVSS provides to assist people to over<Col N="67" />come their trauma is a very small amount of money? The document which was presented to the Minister by the TVSS and is currently under discussion between the TVSS and Bord Fáilte categorically underlines the need for additional funding. Having met representatives of the TVSS, listened to a resume of its work and analysed its work at first hand, does the Minister accept that it is entitled to another £15,000 to £20,000? Will he do everything possible to encourage Bord Fáilte, which receives the bulk of its funding from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, to make a gesture of additional financial support?</P>

      <P>I will discuss it with Bord Fáilte. I consider £15,000, which Bord Fáilte provides, to be a reasonable amount, bearing in mind that the overall running cost of the TVSS is £41,000. The other contributors are Dublin Corporation, Aer Lingus, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and Aer Rianta. The TVSS does an excellent job for a running cost of £41,000. This country has the lowest rate in Europe of crime against tourists. At a time when crime against tourists is decreasing, questions have to be asked. I will have a word with Bord Fáilte, but I think £15,000 is not a bad contribution, given the other expenses of Bord Fáilte and the overall running costs of the TVSS.</P>

        <b>: </b>Has the Minister checked recently the figures for the number of attacks on tourists? Is he aware that there has recently been an upsurge in such attacks? On RTE recently, a representative of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism gave several instances of unprovoked attacks on tourists on the basis of their colour and in the wake of events on 11 September in the United States. Is the Minister aware that a French person of Japanese origin was recently beaten so badly in Dublin that she spent the remaining four days of her holiday locked in her hotel room? Is he aware that a coloured tourist was recently attacked in Tralee and had to spend several days in hospital? Unfortunately, the tribal racism of people who misrepresent the implications of the 11 September atrocity has led to an increase in attacks on tourists. Does the Minister think this should be addressed in the context of his discussions with the TVSS, from the point of view of justifying the sought increases in funds?</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are attacks on tourists. The Deputy maintains that there is a racial element to such attacks. The majority of attacks in Ireland happen in Dublin. The country is a safe place for tourists to come and attacks on tourists are decreasing. I accept that the TVSS does an excellent job. This was evident during the 11 September crisis when, with the Dublin City Centre Business Association, the TVSS used part of St. Stephen's Green to attend to over 500 <Col N="68" />American visitors. I will have a word with Bord Fáilte, but it think the amount being allocated for this service is not small. The Deputy will be kept informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>No official estimates are as yet available in relation to the loss of tourism business arising from the tragic events of 11 September 2001. However, while it may still be too early to assess the overall impact on international travel patterns, it is clear that the terrorist attacks will impact on visitor numbers to Ireland, in particular from America, for the balance of this year and into 2002, probably leading to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for a decade.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has been working on revised estimates for tourism performance in 2001 although it has been difficult to come up with accurate revised forecasts given the varying experiences from the carriers and uncertainty over the nature and duration of the international response to the terrorist attacks. The situation has been further complicated due to the American Airlines crash on 12 November. In the latest edition of its Link magazine, circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, Bord Fáilte forecasts an overall reduction in visitor numbers in 2001 of between 6.5% and 10%. This is equivalent to a reduction of between 420,000 and 598,000 visitors, representing foreign revenue earnings of £168 million, &euro;213 million; and £233 million, &euro;296 million, respectively. However, on the positive side, according to industry sources the past two months have witnessed a particularly robust performance in the domestic market and hopefully this will continue into next year.</P>
      <P>During the launch by Tourism Ireland Limited  &ndash; the new all island tourism marketing company established under the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; of its 2002 marketing plans on 7 November, the company forecast a best case scenario for 2002 which envisaged a return to close to 2000 visitor levels. This assumes a speedy conclusion to military retaliation, non-recurrence of foot and mouth disease and no further reduction in access routes and capacities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" />Since the tragic events of 11 September, officials of my Department have met with senior management of both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited on a very regular basis. I have been in regular contact with the chairman, the acting chief executive and senior executives of Bord Fáilte and with the chairman and chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited to review developments. I also met a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on three separate occasions since 11 September, to take stock of the situation and to discuss appropriate responses. Critical factors in dealing with the crisis include not only the nature and duration of the response to the terrorist attacks but also the speed with which public confidence in air travel can be restored. Unlike the foot and mouth disease crisis, which to some extent was within our own control, there is very little that Ireland can do to influence current international events.</P>
    <P>At my request, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited have urgently re-examined, in consultation with the tourism industry and through the tourism marketing partnership structure, their respective marketing programmes and plans for the remainder of 2001 and 2002. Bord Fáilte subsequently announced details of a £750,000, &euro;952,500, programme of additional immediate measures for the British, Irish, French and German markets and have recently circulated to the trade and other interested parties, and to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, comprehensive details of their full £3.5 million, &euro;4.4 million, autumn programme. Following recent contacts with ITIC, and again at my request, Bord Fáilte has introduced further marketing actions in Britain, Northern Ireland, the US and domestically for the balance of the year at a further cost of £400,000, &euro;507,900.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited, Mr. Paul O'Toole, spearheaded the review of marketing plans for 2002 which culminated in the launch on 7 November in Dublin and Belfast of marketing plans for 2002 and details of a new and exciting television and print international advertising campaign for the island of Ireland, developed at a cost of approximately £4 million, &euro;5million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>New fulfilment literature and market books have been prepared and will be available for the first time ever on an all island basis. The plans for 2002 will be flexible in nature to take account of the changing circumstances arising from the events of 11 September. Particular importance is attached to the partnership approach with industry and there has been extensive consultation, including two meetings of the tourism marketing partnership, in the drawing up of these plans.</P>
    <P>When I met with the ITIC delegation, one of their key priorities was that Tourism Ireland Limited would be fully operational in time for the 2002 marketing season. I am glad to report that Tourism Ireland Limited is fully on track to take <Col N="70" />over full responsibility for international tourism marketing activity on an all island basis next year. The new company will have a programme budget of £21 million, &euro;27 million, for 2002 which will be supplemented by niche and product marketing funding from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The Government is very conscious of the important link between competitive air and sea access and tourism flows. We are particularly well served by the levels of investment in recent years in sea access which has seen the emergence of a high quality and competitive route network, in particular across the Irish Sea. We are acutely aware of the important contribution which Aer Lingus has made to developing tourism traffic over the years, most recently through the extension of their transatlantic network. The priority from a tourism perspective therefore, is the maintenance, as part of the survival plan for the airline, of as much of the pre-11 September service network as possible going into the 2002 season. My Department has been working closely with the Department of Public Enterprise to safeguard as much of the route infrastructure as possible so that, when the recovery comes, we are best placed to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Government is also anxious to promote new air route development, in particular from the large continental European market which has not performed up to expectations in recent years. The recent announcement that Aer Rianta has expanded its incentive scheme for new routes to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports is to be welcomed. An interdepartmental group, under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach and involving representatives of my Department, has been established to look at the interaction between access transport, particularly by air, and tourism with a view to identifying further possibilities for increasing the flow of visitors to Ireland. That work is advancing and I am hopeful that there will be a positive outcome soon.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated significant funding towards tourism development since coming into office. Under the national development plan, a total of £350 million, &euro;444 million, has been earmarked for product, marketing and human resource development. The first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund has been established with a commitment of £150 million, &euro;190 million, over seven years.</P>
    <P>This year, the total Exchequer tourism budget is of the order of £90 million, &euro;114 million. We must ensure that this funding is used in the most effective manner to help address the real development needs of the industry in order to sustain foreign revenue earnings and employment levels. The destination tourism marketing budget of £21 million, &euro;26.6 million, at the disposal of Tourism Ireland Limited in 2002 represents the largest ever budget available for the attraction of international visitors to the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Given the more challenging environment which we are now facing, I believe that it is vitally <Col N="71" />important to quickly bed down the process of institutional change now under way in the tourism State agencies which have remained unchanged in structure since the early 1960s. It is important to complete the start-up of Tourism Ireland Limited so that it is fully operational for the year 2002 marketing season. I also welcome the support of the council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte for the proposed creation of a new national integrated tourism development authority. This initiative also has the support of industry. I will be asking Government very shortly for approval to proceed with the creation of the new body which will require new legislation. The objective is that we have strong structures in place to implement our medium-term plans for international marketing, product and human resource development as contained in the national development plan in order to help the tourism industry to meet the undoubted challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. He made the point that there has been a robust performance in the hotel sector in the past two months but that is primarily because of rates being offered that cannot be sustained. This robust performance is not something that is set to continue. Does the Minister agree that the figures he has given us correspond, more or less, with the figures for 2002 forecast by the Irish Hotels Federation? What is his personal response to the five-pronged package of measures that the Irish Hotels Federation is seeking to have put in place? That package involves the development of the British and European market, the nurturing of the American market, a reduction in local authority and VAT rates and programmes in terms of the environment and transport.</P>
      <P>What exactly is happening in relation to transport into Ireland? In the aviation sector there has been a large reduction in the number of seats but I know the Minister has been trying to encourage people to travel to Ireland by ferry. What is the spare capacity in the ferry sector at the moment and what investigations has he carried out as to what additional capacity can be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry has claimed that there could be a reduction of up to 600,000 people travelling into the country. I accept that there will be deficits and problems, particularly in 2002. However, thanks to the tremendous response of the domestic market and to measures taken by the industry itself, such as extra offers, October has been a buoyant month. Another factor contributing to that was the fact that with decommissioning Ireland is regarded as a safe island. I do not say that this buoyancy will continue but that there are reasons for it and thanks to the initiatives October has been buoyant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite aware of the problems facing the industry in 2002. We set out our plan on 7 November through Tourism Ireland Limited. We had <Col N="72" />originally planned the launch for 7 November and after reassessment and refocussing we were still in position to announce the plans for 2002 on that day. We put the extra funding into the markets, particularly the British market where statistics have shown that up to one million UK visitors have given up on taking holidays this year and we are refocussing on areas such as the European market.</P>
    <P>I explained previously that local authority and VAT rates are not a matter for me. The Deputy should put a question down for the relevant Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's personal view on the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>VAT and rates receipts are totally different in the UK than they are here and statistics from the UK have shown that very few people availed of those measures during the foot and mouth disease. On transport, we have lost 25% capacity on the transatlantic route. The 1.1 million American passengers we carried last year were worth £570 million to the Irish economy. Those are huge figures. Americans make up one sixth of visitor numbers to this country but they make up 25% in foreign revenue terms.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has done a tremendous job on the transatlantic route over the past number of years and we are doing our utmost to ensure that no further gateways or access points from the United States are closed. We are trying desperately to encourage Americans to keep coming here. We have announced a number of new initiatives, through Bord Fáilte, the industry, carriers and car rental firms, to try to get Americans to overcome their fear of flying. I am surprised at the number of Americans who are currently travelling, thanks to the initiatives taken by airlines, including reduced fares. This can only last for a short time because it would not be profitable to continue. We are trying to persuade Americans to overcome their fear of flying.</P>
      <P>There are also opportunities in Europe. I have talked to a number of people who have businesses in countries such as Morocco, Egypt and Turkey and who tell me they have had between 40% and 60% cancellations from northern Europe since 11 September. The recent decommissioning of weapons by the IRA will cause many Europeans to regard Ireland as a safer destination and northern Europeans are coming to Ireland for niche activities such as golf. I hope they will refocus on Ireland. We will refocus on the European market and try to attract these visitors. Ireland is a safe country and if we do our marketing properly we should attract more European tourists next year than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have believed the Minister could squeeze so much into a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his response to Deputy O'Shea, the Minister accepted that there will be a deficit in the tourism figures for 2002. In his initial response he said <Col N="73" />that Tourism Ireland estimates that figures will be back up to 2000 levels in 2002. There seems to be a contradiction between the Minister's position and that of Tourism Ireland. Can he elaborate on this? Does the Tourism Ireland figure take into consideration the current downturn in the Irish economy and the effect of the airline accident on 12 November?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe there is a need for co-ordination between Tourism Ireland and the various other marketing organisations, such as Heritage Ireland and Houses and Castles of Ireland, rather than each organisation promoting its own sectional interest?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister discussed with Tourism Ireland the possibility of flexibility with regard to grants paid for the development of various sectors? For example, one of the conditions attached to the great gardens of Ireland grant is that a full-time gardener must be employed. Many of these gardens are small and due to the this year's downturn in tourism find it uneconomic to employ a full-time gardener. Tourism Ireland is not taking a flexible approach to this matter and has asked recipients of grants to ensure the gardener is paid or return the grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted assume a best case scenario. A return to the 2000 figures by 2002 is the best we can hope for. It is estimated that tourist numbers in 2001 will fall by between 6.5% and 10%. The tourism industry was recovering from the effects of foot and mouth disease and foreign tourism revenue for 2000 was up by 15%. The industry was beginning to recover before 11 September.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy says about my reply of 4 October. There has been a wide range of consultations with the various people concerned with the stadium. The delay has been caused by the amount of consultation which <Col N="75" />has taken place. With regard to the figure of £625 million, there have been several reports on this matter in various newspapers.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to building a stadium. The case for it was made at the last soccer international when the international and national media described our sports infrastructure as the worst in Europe.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed that some parts of the project are to be long-fingered. The Government is committed to Sports Campus Ireland. Because of the changing economic situation it is proposed to go ahead with the Abbottstown element first, in preparation for the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>
      <P>This country requires a substantial soccer stadium. The game against Iran was arranged at very short notice and the IRFU had already scheduled the international rugby match with Samoa.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it will be at least 2005 or 2006 before the stadium is built, the various international teams visiting Ireland will face difficulties in the meantime. Surely there is a clear case to be made to the GAA to allow the playing of soccer and rugby at Croke Park, especially as half of the pitch is covered in tarmacadam while the Hogan Stand is being completed. A new pitch will have to be laid and in view of this does the Minister agree it is time for the Government to provide funding for a proper <Col N="76" />international playing surface and the other requisite facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should answer my question. The current situation represents an ideal opportunity to provide for a proper playing surface. Nobody would deny further funding provided the GAA allows the playing of soccer and rugby at Croke Park. That is Fine Gael policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that national sporting organisations cannot be told what to do. Funding is provided to the national governing bodies but there can be no interference in their policies. I hope we qualify for the World Cup next year and if we are to co-host the European Championships there will be a huge outcry about the state of our playing conditions. I agree with Deputy Deenihan's concerns in that regard. I believe Croke Park should be opened to all sporting activities but it is a matter for the GAA. I hope the organisation takes this approach in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 82, 83, 86, 91, 92, 95, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 117, 118, 120, 210, 223, 225, 227, 228, 243, 250 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>There is a long response to these questions, parts of which are new. With the agreement of Deputies I will omit those parts of the answer which overlap with answers to previous questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No official estimates are as yet available on the loss of tourism business from the United States or elsewhere arising from the tragic events of 11 September 2001. However, while it may still be too early to assess the overall impact on international travel patterns, it is clear the terrorist attacks will impact on visitor numbers to Ireland, in particular from America, for the balance of this year and into 2002, probably leading to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for a decade. Under the framework of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, published in November 1999, a number of indicators and targets have been set for tourism performance over the life of the plan. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism were projected to grow at an annual average rate of 5%, while a reduction of 2% was targeted over the seven year period in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. In addition, an increase of 3% in the proportion of total out-of-State tourism revenue accruing to the <Col N="80" />Border, midlands and western region was targeted over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>For the year 2000, the first full year of the NDP, foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by approximately 15% &ndash; well ahead of the target of 5% &ndash; while there was a reduction by 1% in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. Progress against the regional target was also satisfactory, with a gain of more than 2% in the proportion of tourism revenue accruing to the BMW region. While the above outcome is encouraging, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for a single year in the context of multi-annual target setting. It is inevitable that the recent unexpected setbacks will make the achievement by industry of the NDP targets more challenging over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited, Mr. Paul O'Toole, spearheaded the review of marketing plans for 2002, which culminated in the launch on 7 November in Dublin and Belfast of marketing plans for 2002 and details of a new and exciting TV and print international advertising campaign for the island of Ireland, developed at a cost of approximately £4 million. The plans for 2002 will be flexible in nature to take account of the changing circumstances arising from the events of 11 September. The focus on Britain, our nearest and largest market, will be emphasised by Tourism Ireland Limited in the light of recent events. There is an opportunity for the short breaks and additional holiday market and Ireland is well positioned as a destination that is easily accessible by sea, particularly for the own car segment. Tourism Ireland Limited also intends to revive the holiday market from Europe during 2002 through prioritising geographic markets, by selectively encouraging and supporting new access gateways and routes into Ireland and by fostering switch selling by tour operators. Particular importance is attached to the partnership approach with industry and there has been extensive consultation, including two meetings of the Tourism Marketing Partnership, in the drawing up of these plans. I believe the TMP, rather than the reactivation of the High Level Foot and Mouth Industry Group, is the best mechanism to input the views of the tourism industry present.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Government has allocated significant funding to tourism. Under the national development plan, a total of £350 million has been earmarked for product marketing and human resource development. The first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund has been established, with a commitment of £150 million over seven years.</P>
    <P>As regards calls for rates relief by the Irish Hotels Federation, I should point out that such relief is primarily a matter for the local authorities and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has matured greatly in recent years and has built up a tremendous prod<Col N="81" />uct base which makes Ireland a very attractive international tourist destination. I welcome the response of many businesses in the sector who are already readjusting their marketing and pricing strategies to secure extra business in the current difficult climate. We must maintain competitiveness and keep prices as attractive as possible. I am confident the recent attractively priced offers from the air and sea carriers, accommodation providers and others will begin the process of working our way out of present problems. The Irish population and Irish businesses can play their part too in taking a decision to holiday and hold conferences at home and I have specifically written to my ministerial colleagues asking them to encourage their Departments and agencies to hold conferences and events in Ireland whenever possible.</P>
    <P>We have had nine uninterrupted years of growth in tourism. The years 2001 and 2002 will undoubtedly be challenging but we have a strong and vibrant industry with the strength to get through this unprecedented crisis and I believe we will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to issues I raised as priority questions. The Minister said the best case scenario in terms of tourism figures is a return to 2000 levels. Can the Minister give an estimate for the worst case scenario? Does he agree there is a need for a flexible approach to be taken in relation to the grants paid by Bord Fáilte in light of changing circumstances, including foot and mouth, 11 September, 12 November and the downturn in the economy? Does he agree it is necessary to ensure none of these grant aided developments closes and that the infrastructure must be in place for the future development of tourism? Does the Minister agree there is a need for a co-ordinated approach to marketing programmes within and outside the country between Tourism Ireland and organisations such as Heritage Ireland, and the houses, castles and gardens of Ireland organisations? Given the loss of 30 jobs in the Minister's constituency with the closure of Go-Ireland.com in Letterkenny, does he believe it is necessary to review the contracts of groups with Gulliver in relation to selling hotel beds and holidays, and that the structures should be opened to realise the maximum potential from such services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The worst case scenario in terms of tourism figures is minus 17%. I believe in flexibility and will inquire about the issue raised by the Deputy in this regard. I am not sure about the contracts as they involve EU money, and I cannot give a definite answer, but I will try to get information regarding flexibility. Regarding co-ordination, that is not a matter for TIL. I agree with co-ordination between the regional tourism authorities and the various enterprises mentioned by the Deputy, but we must remember that the one specific focus of TIL is marketing Ireland as <Col N="82" />a destination. TIL will focus on all our main markets, be it the UK or the US or the 15 different markets in Europe.</P>
      <P>Regarding job losses following the closure of Go-Ireland, and Fexco and the Gulliver system, I am not sure I understand the Deputy. The extended contract with Gulliver ends next July and it is open for enterprises to tender thereafter.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte is making £750,000 available. Am I correct in saying that is from the board's own resources? Is the Government providing additional funding for the marketing programme mentioned by the Government? If Bord Fáilte is making it available from its own resources, on what programmes has it cut back? Regarding the request from the Irish Hotels Federation and others for rate relief, does the Minister agree there are businesses in serious trouble through no fault of their own? Does he agree he has more or less rubbished the request? Does he know why the Northern Ireland package was not taken up? It seems strange for businesses not to take up money that was going abegging? Was the package not good enough?</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy came into the House I mentioned we have examined and refocused on the marketing programme for the end of this year and into 2002. This is a very attractive country to visit. We have a number of things in our favour, including in the past few weeks decommissioning and the idea we are a safe place to visit. People who may have planned to go elsewhere are readjusting their plans and I hope we are in a position to benefit from those changes in plans. Access is important. It has been proven time and time again that where the cost of access is low people will respond. This has been proven in parts of Europe where, for example, access has been opened up from Frankfurt to Shannon and is a huge success simply because of the low cost involved. Since 11 September, most carriers have become low cost carriers and we must provide the necessary incentives to ensure we are at the coalface.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the MRBI report. I was of the opinion that in niche areas such as food this country had an excellent reputation. Accommodation can be expensive in some areas. All of us have continuously pointed out that if operators make Ireland a high cost destination we will no longer be a popular destination. Members on all sides of the House have repeatedly appealed for competitiveness given the discerning visitors who now travel here. We must be as competitive as possible and I appeal to people in areas where accommodation is expensive to rethink that aspect. If what the Deputy says is true, I foresee problems ahead if we become known as a high cost destination.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept it is ironic that this confidential internal report which obviously has been leaked to the media should be presented on the week the Minister and his colleague in the North launches Tourism Ireland? Does he accept that such a report by an organisation directly under his command should be addressed immediately? The report refers to over-priced hotels, guesthouses and B &amp; Bs, seaside holiday villages and high density hotels not being the preferred option of holidaymakers. It states that traditional, natural and affordable accommodation is the preferred choice and, in the context of European tourists in particular, it complains about lack of entertainment for children. As these key elements are identified by an organisation which has commissioned a report by <Col N="84" />the top marketing bureau in the country they should be addressed as a matter of urgency to identify the defects.</P>

I am trying to bring about a merger of these two organisations to be named the tourism development agency or another name yet to be found. That will bring together the remnants of Bord Fáilte and CERT, given the excellent work that organisation has been doing, to ensure the statistics the Deputy says have been leaked do not occur. We are doing everything possible to ensure this country remains a very popular destination and, given the funding which is being provided, I hope we will be able to overcome these difficulties.</P>

In the meantime, I regularly come across English, French, German and continental tourists who have come here to fish and who say this is their first visit to Ireland and that had they been aware of what we have to offer they would have visited here sooner. That indicates our marketing strategy is not satisfactory and that there are thousands of people in England, France and Germany who are anxious to come here but are not aware that we have such facilities to offer. We take it for granted that these people are aware of what we have to offer. While I do not wish to be critical, I believe those involved in marketing have not done a satisfactory job.</P>

There are tonnes of print material available and we should be cutting down in that area. However, I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan in regard to angling. When the Government took up office there was a problem in the area of angling and there have been problems in the past four or five years. We have put a great deal of funding and marketing into golf in the past ten or 12 years which has paid handsome dividends. We should now concentrate more on angling tourism which has huge potential. I am told there are more anglers in the UK than the numbers who go to football matches on Sunday afternoons. These people are high spenders and I assure the Deputy that <Col N="85" />marketing will focus on the new niche area of angling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a point about sexual abuse of girls, boys and women. The sentence handed down in a case which came to light in this city involving a student and visitor has appalled people. There is no deterrent and this type of activity must be stamped out. Young girls and boys, and people in general, must feel safe going out to socialise. The recent two year sentence is an insult to those who suffered as a result of this crime. I question the mindset of the Judiciary when dealing with these people. The minimum sentence should be ten years with no time off for good behaviour but time added on for bad behaviour. It is important that people feel free. We have a wonderful society and a booming economy. People have more disposable income and wish to enjoy themselves as, of course, they are entitled to do and, in that context, any form of abuse is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>It is important that there is support for women who find themselves pregnant and have a difficulty. If there is adequate back-up support, many women in crisis pregnancies might not seek abortion. I believe it is wrong and an element of guilt follows, with which people have to live. If such women or girls were encouraged to continue the pregnancy to full term and found they were not in a position to rear the baby, there are many families who are not blessed with children and who would be glad to adopt that child and provide a good home for him or her. Other families may wish to foster a child. Such arrangements could be made more widely if appropriate support services were available.</P>
      <P>In the past, babies born outside of marriage were often given up for adoption, without the mother knowing the subsequent whereabouts of her baby. Children placed in those circumstances subsequently spent their adult years trying to find their real parents. That information should be freely available to them. Why the secrecy? If the mother wanted secrecy, one must also have regard to the feelings of the child or, in due course, the young adult. I know of a young man who had been adopted as a child and only discovered when he grew up that he had a sister, whom he spent many years trying to find. There was a wonderful reunion when they eventually met. The people concerned should have ready access to information to enable them to trace their blood relations. I can understand the position of a mother who feels she has to give up her child for adoption but I do not accept that she can deny the child the right to identify her or any other children she may have.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the wording of the amendment, as such, but I am concerned that the background to it is not as clear-cut as it might be. People who have spoken and written to me have raised difficulties as to when life begins. The Government has a responsibility to such people to clarify that issue. I grew up with the belief that life begins at conception but there seems to be another school of thought, which I find unacceptable. For that reason, my party takes the view that we should hasten slowly, rather than rushing into this referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in this House has been of a very <Col N="87" />high standard and I have no difficulty with the genuine concerns which were reflected in the contributions to the debate from all sides of the House. Out in the public arena, there is a discussion, rather than a debate, in progress. Perhaps we now have a more open society and people are more balanced in their approach. It is important that people are very clear on the issues involved and I hope we will come to a conclusion which will be acceptable to the majority of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this Bill. So far, the comments on all sides of the House have been constructive, without any gross exaggeration or rancour, compared with what took place in previous debates on this issue in 1983 and 1992. The issue has been debated, on and off, over the past 20 years, thus indicating that we have not resolved the issue of abortion as yet. The current Bill approaches the issue on three different levels &ndash; constitutional, legislative and caring, or practical aspects. No legislation or constitutional changes, <i>per se</i>, will resolve the sensitive issue of abortion. Much anxiety has arisen since the 1992 X case which, in the opinion of many people, did not represent best practice in regard to psychiatric care of a pregnant person. All this evolved on account of the suicide issue, which has been the subject of some excellent contributions to this debate, particularly by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Dr. O'Hanlon. He cited a great deal of relevant information in regard to suicide in pregnancy. The Irish College of Psychiatrists is of the opinion that suicide is not a major threat in pregnancy and that pregnancy even protects against the very aspect of suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychiatrists in the UK and worldwide have also come to the same conclusion. Dr. O'Hanlon cited several references in that regard. It is an easy option, in regard to the threat of suicide, to invoke abortion but the correct approach should be to treat the person who has suicidal thoughts. That is the way forward in terms of best practice in regard to psychiatric care. Undoubtedly, there has been a huge increase in abortion rates, as evidenced by the figures we have from the UK and this demands a new approach on our part. As the Taoiseach has said, we do not have the option of doing nothing &ndash; we must deal with the issue. Obstetricians and gynaecologists are unsure of the legal position that pertains in many emergency situations, in regard to the health and well-being of the pregnant patient. The indemnity situation has gone out of hand, particularly for obstetricians and gynaecologists, some of whom are paying £60,000 to £100,000 per annum for indemnity cover in relation to their practices. The proposed legislation sets out an acceptable position with regard to the rights of the mother and the unborn, with no fear or ambiguity regarding the preservation of the life of the mother in certain critical situations, especially from the obstetrical point of view. The College of Obstetricians <Col N="88" />and Gynaecologists has said it accepts, in general, the views expressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition of abortion is a pragmatic one, which will allow the use of the morning after pill and the intrauterine contraceptive device. This is a very important advance, particularly when facing cases of rape, incest and, especially, uncertainty about the possibility of lapses of mature sexual behaviour.</P>
    <P>The advent of the crisis pregnancy agency is a very positive step. I know both sides of the House are claiming credit for this, but it does not matter who initiated this. Even though some people have criticised the fact that not enough money has been given to it and that the amount only represents £1,000 per person that might travel to the UK for an abortion. However, it is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is an area that has much potential, especially in the preventative aspects of abortion. It will lead to better education, better care and will look at the problem in a very sympathetic way. We have the possibility of better counselling, proper medical care and above all it gives rise to the possibility of genetic testing for people who are at risk of abnormalities, whether physical or metabolic in nature. All these issues can be dealt with under this umbrella. This is the most important part that has been introduced to date. Some people have suggested that we have not moved forward from the position in 1983 or 1992. However, even if we move forward with the crisis pregnancy agency, it will be something to our credit.</P>
    <P>Society in general has changed in the recent years. We have become more tolerant in our attitudes and this is for the better. Yet, that is not to say that deliberate induced abortion is ever right. Medical ethics demand <i>primum non nocere</i>: whatever we do we must not cause any damage or hurt. There is no place in obstetrical practice to do wrong to a woman or her unborn child. The fact that other jurisdictions may have lower standards or look at these issues in a different way, perhaps in the guise that they may be more humane does not augur well for that society which forgets the right to life of both the mother and the child. That is not to say we can afford to be too judgmental on these issues. Neither does it demand that we should provide the right to choose scenario that many have put forward. This would then be more <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> and would not be a real argument to the issue of abortion<i> per se</i>.</P>
    <P>Mothers have the right to information and to travel. This might suggest that we are hypocritical, anti-woman, and two-faced and that we are running away from the issues and not facing up to our obligations. However this is not so. We can only lay down the law with regard to our own jurisdiction. What is done in other jurisdictions is not really our business. As legislators, we have no right to ask obstetricians, gynaecologists, midwives, anaesthetists and others in this country to do something inherently wrong in itself.</P>
    <P>We have a problem and people say we should not export it. However, the measures incorporated in this Bill will help to address some of the <Col N="89" />issues that surround abortion. We have come a long way since 1983 and 1992 with the right to information, the right to travel, the morning after pill and the intrauterine device. Even though it is disputed at the moment, the definition of abortion is more pragmatic. The crisis pregnancy agency, to which I already referred, has great potential. There are major attitudinal changes, which have taken place since 1983 and 1992 when this was previously discussed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has played a major part in assisting people in devastating conditions with social problems. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has also played its part with regard to housing for individuals who find themselves in difficult circumstances. We are looking at disabilities in a different mode and we are coming around to addressing these issues in a more pragmatic manner. The Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science have also moved along during that time. We have a better society with regard to how we treat sensitive issues like abortion.</P>
    <P>We still have difficulties and they will remain. Developments in human reproduction will give people better control over such matters in the future, without having to resort to abortion as the answer for unexpected hard cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents the best effort of Government to tackle the problem of abortion and its many faceted complications in a caring and pragmatic manner. I hope the people will support the referendum when it comes about. It is a very difficult matter to deal with and the best efforts of Governments previously have not succeeded in getting it off the agenda. Nevertheless, what is proposed in this Bill is a genuine effort by the Government to move forward and give practical help by way of treating the whole issue.</P>
    <P>The crisis pregnancy agency will prove to be very successful. If it prevents a number of people from having abortions, then it will have been a success. Constitutional change <i>per se</i> will not prevent abortion, but what is in this Bill will help to a certain extent. At the same time we are not being too judgmental with mothers who have to take the road to abortion in another jurisdiction. I hope we will provide for them and everybody in a pragmatic and caring fashion.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Moffatt, I am pleased we are having a very rational debate on the abortion issue now. I am privileged to follow Deputy Moffatt and you a Leas Cheann Comhairle, both eminent doctors and to be joined in the Chamber by Deputy Michael Higgins.</P>
      <P>We are now on the Second Stage of the Bill and Members are getting an opportunity to put their concerns and views on the record. To some extent, this is opening up a debate on the proposed legislation. That may serve some purpose in developing a debate outside the House. However, I am surprised at the lack of real debate on this subject, outside the House at this time, despite the fact that people have had the opportunity to study the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had very little communication, contact <Col N="90" />or correspondence from my constituents on the matter. This could mean one of three things. It could mean the public is satisfied with the proposals. It could mean the public has very little interest in the proposals, or it could mean the public is waiting for the referendum to give its verdict. In other words are they waiting in the long grass? I do not know the answer to that, but there is a great silence out there.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, like other Deputies, I have received about 200 items of correspondence about this issue. This was mainly from people advocating a referendum to ensure constitutional protection for the life of the unborn and I have had some other correspondence on the matter.</P>
    <P>Since the Government proposals were announced, we in Fine Gael have studied them seriously and have looked at the problem seriously. Our spokesman prepared a 20-page response seeking clarification on about 30 aspects of the Government's proposals. It is the duty of an opposition to question. We are not here to rubber stamp everything the Government comes up with. We have to examine it and question it and sometimes people do not understand that. We received a reply to our question from the Taoiseach's office which we accepted as a serious attempt to deal with our concerns, but were far from satisfied. We tabled an amendment asking that we do not proceed with the Committee Stage for a period of three months so as to get further clarification of the Bill's legal and other aspects which are causing us concern. I will support that reasonable amendment when it is put to the House at the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>About 200 people contacted me on this matter in the past two years and, despite my communicating with all of them to seek their views on this Bill, only six responded and their reactions were mixed. They ranged from complete rejection of the Government's proposals in the belief that they will make matters worse, to seeing them as going some way towards protecting the life of the unborn. I cannot analyse why people are holding their counsel.</P>
    <P>Many speakers dealt with the rights of the mother and rightly so. These are adequately dealt with, but the proposals also deal with the right to life of the unborn. The principal proposal attempts to deal with the court ruling in the X case. The removal of the suicide clause is the only reason for this referendum, but the people already decided in the 1992 referendum to retain this constitutional protection, which was then overruled by the Supreme Court. Some people, in the House and outside, interpret this simply and say that there are only two options if a threat of suicide exists &ndash; the woman can commit suicide or travel to England for an abortion.</P>
    <P>A third option is to give the pregnant woman the support to carry her pregnancy to full term which is important. It can save both the life of the mother, which Dr. O'Hanlon dealt with earlier, and that of the child. Such support in the first instance comes from family and friends. Many in this House have given that support and would do so again if faced with the challenge. There should also be State support. Will the proposed refer<Col N="91" />endum assist the estimated 6,000 women who go annually to Britain for abortions? The answer is that it will not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesman on health, produced a private Member's Bill to assist mothers with crisis pregnancies. Dr. Moffat stated that it has Government support. We do not mind who takes credit for it as it was a genuine move by Fine Gael to address the issue of support for women in these circumstances. Women who experience crisis pregnancies need State support. For too long the State failed to establish proper support structures leaving the work to excellent but over stretched and under resourced voluntary organisations. Fine Gael proposes the establishment of such support through a care of the persons board which would support and facilitate any expectant mother experiencing a crisis pregnancy to bring it to full term. We have a tendency to seek comprehensive solutions to problems and to take no action until we have the magic formula.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate is for or against a further constitutional amendment. Fine Gael played its part in the All-party Committee on the Constitution in relation to abortion. It was Fine Gael's input which resulted in the recommendation of a body to support women in crisis pregnancy and unborn children. Whatever the Government's final proposals on abortion are, we still need those support structures. Since the X case a decade ago, too much time was lost instead of establishing these support structures. As a matter of policy, our parliamentary party endorsed the creation of such a body.</P>
    <P>No one knows the exact number of Irish women who obtain abortions outside the State, but clearly a significant number do. The media report it at 6,000 while statistics supplied to the Oireachtas committee by the office of national statistics for England and Wales show that in 1971, 578 women normally resident in the Republic had abortions and in 1999, it was estimated at 6,226. Some reports view these as under estimates. We have a responsibility to enact legislation to give whatever support we can to avoid these abortions.</P>
    <P>Our Bill contains provisions for a board which should consist of 12 members, with a three year term of office, appointed by the Minister for Health and Children subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann. The Minister shall appoint a chairperson from among its members and the chairman shall at least annually, and when required by the Oireachtas committee appointed by both Houses for that purpose, appear before such a committee to account for the discharge of the board's responsibilities. Its role shall be to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any expectant mother resident in Ireland shall receive every necessary support, including advice, financial support, accommodation and health care to ensure that every assistance is available during a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>These are practical steps that our party wants to take and I am sure other parties will support them. The board's role shall be to support, <Col N="92" />encourage and facilitate any expectant mother to bring her pregnancy to full term. We provide that this should include giving every reasonable assistance to a mother and child or children after the birth of a child or children. Support should also be extended to the expectant mother's family members or other persons connected with her at the board's discretion. Support or assistance from the board shall require the expectant mother's consent.</P>
    <P>We are not above having these proposals improved or amended by any Government. Section 7 of our Bill provides that the board may by itself, or with the representative of particular groups or organisations that it considers appropriate, establish schemes to protect and support the expectant mother and her unborn child or children. The board shall have a chief executive who shall account to the Committee of Public Accounts in the normal way for moneys under the board's care. We make such a proposal because we expect the board to be generously funded but it must keep its staffing requirements and overheads to what is absolutely necessary to ensure maximum resources are made available to mothers in a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Our proposal is to provide £50 million for this board over a ten year period. If £5 million per year does not meet the requirements then it can be reviewed by the Oireachtas committee to which the board will report. Fine Gael is committed to social justice. We are trying to bring about a real and practical contribution to addressing this serious problem. We believe the creation of the board as provided for in the Bill we have published will be a real and positive step towards caring for women with crisis pregnancies and their families.</P>
    <P>Those are practical steps that can be taken. It is not simplistic to say the Government proposal condemns a woman in a crisis pregnancy to suicide or to go abroad for an abortion. There is a third option. We must all play our part in supporting, as far as practically possible, that third option, whether it be within or outside our families. If the support is forthcoming, I have no doubt that great help can be given to expectant mothers in what is termed &ldquo;crisis pregnancies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are some questions about the Bill as proposed. Several of our spokespersons have raised those questions. We hope that in the course of this debate we may be able to get answers to the queries we have raised about the legalities or otherwise of sections of what is proposed. As legislators, we want to be very clear that we support or reject Government proposals only after careful consideration and we are not doing it for any political or other ulterior motive. In some instances our motives in this regard may be misunderstood by the electorate. Some people look at this as a black and white issue, one is either for abortion or for the protection of the rights of the unborn. It is not a black and white issue. We do not want to make circumstances any worse than they are at present. In 1992, when the referendum to protect the life of the unborn under the Constitution was ratified, the electorate thought the issue had been closed. The Supreme Court ruled <Col N="93" />otherwise. If the referendum is passed, do we want to have someone refer this to the Supreme Court?</P>
    <P>There are many questions to answer and many questions still to be asked. That is why Fine Gael has proposed what we consider to be a very reasonable amendment. We propose that Committee Stage of this Bill will not proceed for a fixed period until we are able to get answers to the questions which are causing us such grave concerns. I will only touch on some of the questions to be asked. There is a lack of clarity in the proposed regulations and legislation. I want to highlight the 17th Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and how it will sit if the referendum is approved. The 17th Protocol, inserted by the then Fianna Fáil-PD coalition, stated, &ldquo;Nothing in the Treaty on the European Union . . . shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution of Ireland.&rdquo; Article 40.3.3 states, &ldquo;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo; This referendum proposes to insert Articles 40.3.4 and 40.3.5. The Taoiseach has stated that this legislation will have no EU law implications. The Government has changed its opinion on this issue at least two or three times. In the Dáil on October 9 the Taoiseach stated that the change to the Maastricht protocol was probably not necessary. He later stated that a change to the protocol was probably necessary. There are questions hanging over this regarding the EU. There is the issue of a fundamental charter or constitution being drawn up by the EU. There is also the issue of the EU incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. I understand that some of the case law built up around the convention stresses the right to life of the mother as against the right to life of the unborn. A protocol that cites a particular Article of the Constitution applies only to that section.</P>
    <P>There are several questions on this issue, I have asked only one that comes to mind. It is reasonable for Fine Gael to want those questions teased out before we have to decide what we are presenting to the people, or what our attitude will be when it is presented. Are we doing something that will help to protect the lives of the mother and the unborn child? Or are we doing something which might affect those rights more seriously and might leave us in worse circumstances than those that now exist? I do not know what the attitude of the people will be to this referendum. I am not getting much feedback on it. What happens if the proposals are defeated in the referendum? Do we introduce legislation to deal with the effects of the X case? Those are among the serious questions that must be addressed before we can come to a conclusion on what the Government is proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's package of proposals for constitutional and legislative reform in regard to the protection of human life in pregnancy. As someone who campaigned extensively during the 1983 referendum campaign to insert the eighth amendment in the Constitution I am only too aware of how emotive is this important issue.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the Taoiseach that doing nothing is not an option. The only defence against the widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion is the ethical consensus in the medical profession and the terms of the 1983 amendment demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas to protect the right to life of the unborn child and the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from talking to people from many different backgrounds in recent years that people are not happy with the current position of abortion in the Constitution. Citizens want something done about this issue. That is why I am delighted with this initiative as it gives all of us an opportunity to amend the Constitution to ensure the right to life of the unborn and to protect the life of the mother.</P>
      <P>It is not right that the only defence against the widespread use of the X case as a basis for social abortion is the ethical consensus of the medical profession. The vast majority of people are not comfortable with this position and it puts an unfair burden on the profession. I urge everybody to take this opportunity to put things right and support the Government's proposal for constitutional change.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the 1992 referendum left a widespread feeling of unfinished business and the electorate has demanded a response in terms of constitutional or legislative change or both. The Taoiseach's stated position prior to the 1997 general election was that the key element in establishing a national consensus and in creating a workable legal basis for protecting the life of both women and the unborn is to give the people a direct say in resolving that unfinished business. I am delighted for those reasons that the Taoiseach's commitment has been fulfilled and the electorate will be given an opportunity to put things right in the Constitution on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's package of proposals has resulted from detailed consultation and consideration since 1997 and could not be described as a knee jerk reaction or as being hastily cobbled together. There has been a lengthy, democratic and inclusive process. The Government established an interdepartmental working group in 1997 whose findings were considered by a Cabinet sub-committee and the process resulted in the publication of a Green Paper in September 1999. The Green Paper, in turn, was referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by <Col N="95" />Deputy Brian Lenihan, and there was general agreement during the committee's proceedings. Its report was fair, balanced and of value in educating and informing public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Government then established a Cabinet sub-committee to consider the options and to prepare proposals for consideration and the all-party committee reported in November 2000. The outcome of these extensive deliberations has led us to conclude that no single sentence or paragraph can be inserted in the Constitution which by itself would amount to a balanced, effective legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour as a result of our proposal to amend the Constitution and to bring in legislation which will allow us to strike a complex balance. There are a few important issues for the electorate, the first of which relates to what the amendment will do. I am satisfied the amendment, which will insert two new subsections in Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution, and the parallel legislation will address the complex issue surrounding the protection of unborn human life. At the same time the amendment ensures that pregnant women will continue to have access to all necessary medical treatment if problems arise in the course of their pregnancy.</P>
    <P>It is also important, as the electorate goes to vote, that people understand the relationship between the referendum and the legislation. A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will only be made if the Oireachtas enacts this Bill, as drafted, within six months. This is only right and proper because it is imperative that the people know exactly what they are voting for and when they do so they will be clear on what the legislation will entail.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in line with the third option outlined in the all-party committee's report. For the first time in legislation the Bill protects women and the unborn in pregnancy. It accommodates existing medical practice, which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risk and it gives complete protection to the necessary medical procedures. It protects the life of the unborn in the strongest way and it protects against social abortion. It is important to deal in the debate with issues such as suicide and the right to travel. The Bill provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be grounds for legal abortion in this State. The Government believes that the conclusions in the report of the all-party committee do not support maintenance of the suicide risk as grounds for abortion in Ireland and I fully concur with this view. It should be noted that the risk of suicide has only been advanced as grounds for abortion in cases where the State directly or indirectly attempted to restrict the freedom of the woman to travel. The terms of the new law will protect that freedom to travel as was decreed by the people in the 1992 referendum.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack spoke about the third <Col N="96" />option and I agree with him. The Government has also shown its concern for women in crisis pregnancy by the establishment of the new crisis pregnancy agency by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. The crisis pregnancy agency will draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy, promote options other than abortion and provide post-abortion services. Crucially, preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on all of us to do all in our power to assist women in considering options other than abortion. A woman faced with a crisis pregnancy should be enabled to consider other options carefully and should be assisted before making a decision on the course of action she wishes to take. These are the issues that will be dealt with by the new crisis pregnancy agency.</P>
    <P>The proposals for constitutional and legislative change regarding the protection of human life in pregnancy are part of the Government's response to the issue of crisis pregnancy. The crisis pregnancy agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated responsive and appropriate services. It is the Government's hope that over time this will reduce the instances of crisis pregnancies among Irish women and give women in this situation the widest possible range of assistance.</P>
    <P>We all know that this is one of the most difficult issues that can ever face a person, be it in private or public life. Just because it is a difficult issue does not mean that we should run away from it. The proposals which will be put before the people represent what this Government believes to be a fair reflection of the point of view that abortion should not be permitted in this country but that we must also safeguard medical procedures required to protect the lives of mothers. The legal proposals are supported by the first comprehensive national initiative to help prevent unwanted pregnancies and to support women who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I have never made any secret of the fact that I am a supporter of the pro life movement and that I do not want abortion on demand in this country. I am satisfied that the Government proposals offer very strong protection for the unborn and ensure that social abortion will not be available in Ireland. I welcome the fact that our legislation offers protection to the lives of mothers and at long last a Government of this country has had the foresight to set up an agency to deal with crisis pregnancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy for those who are asking for mature, rational, sympathetic and carefully thought out debate. Unfortunately, having been involved in most referenda dealing with matters like this for over a quarter of a century, history is against such an aspiration. The referendum will be bitter and divisive. The degree to which it is so may vary. My hope is like <Col N="97" />theirs, that it will not be so, but it is likely that it will at least in some places be just that.</P>
      <P>I recall just over 25 years ago when I was a Member of the other House being one of the co-signatories to a Bill to abolish the status of illegitimacy. On that occasion the Bill was defeated with only 12 votes in favour. That was in 1974-75. When I made the case for the rights of the child born out of wedlock I was accused by a Senator of the day of being in favour of &ldquo;socialism under the sheets&rdquo;. That was the phrase used. The suggestion was that the son of the big farmer in Meath or elsewhere had the right to go to the dogs. It was suggested in the Seanad that he could &ldquo;sow his wild oats&rdquo; with total impunity from any consequences of his actions. The real social danger of that time in the 1970s was that the farm would be put in danger by such a child emerging out of the darkness and claiming the rights to property that the other children in the family might have. It was an abject time and it was a despicable kind of debate.</P>
      <P>At that time, such children were being sent into institutions which were not invigilated by the Departments of the day and we are now dealing with the consequences of the abandoned and unwanted children. Going back a decade earlier to my county of Clare, a district justice on a bad day would advise someone who had committed a crime that he should go to England. The defending solicitor would stand up and say: &ldquo;Your Honour, he is going to England tomorrow&rdquo;. We could get rid of our problems to England.</P>
      <P>This is precisely what this proposal does &ndash; the difficult case of a woman in the greatest distress, prone to suicide being told this afternoon in the month of November 2001, that she is free to travel. Just as before, the women would be driven into the Magdalen home, just as before the women would be driven from their parish. Now the grounds of being prone to suicide that are accepted in medical practice all around the world will not be recognised in modern, progressive Ireland. The woman is told that she is free to travel. Why? Because the absolutists at home wanted to create a situation where they are able to exercise judgments which I would find difficult to make.</P>
      <P>The distinguished public servant, Dr. Whitaker, whom I admire in so many different ways for his contribution to Irish life, chaired the 1996 expert constitutional review group. He considered the issue in detail and came to the conclusion that there was no consensus as to what any amendment of the Constitution should be, that not only should the Government legislate in line with the X case but that it was the only practical possibility that was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what is happening? We are going to the country to stop a woman prone to suicide from having facilities available to her that were available up to now. In addition, we are refusing to legislate. You, Sir, are chairing a Legislature &ndash; this Dáil &ndash; and this House has my respect. Is it <Col N="98" />not an extraordinary situation where the Constitution is to be used as some kind of trailer before the main film? You have a referendum to throw into the Constitution something that may come to be from the Legislature in the future. All those who wrote about constitutions &ndash; people like Sartori, the distinguished theorist of constitutions &ndash; said that constitutions should have certainty. That principle is violated here. What is happening is that the Government being gutless refuses to legislate in accordance with the X case and, more than that, no member of the medical profession can tell me or has told me that legislation would not suffice to satisfy such medical practice as was taking place. On the contrary, they said if the legislation would only become coterminous with the constitutional provision, then in our far from perfect situation, we would be able to continue. However, the Government has decided to go to the people to ensure that, in the rare cases where a woman is prone to suicide, she will go to England.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to some of the previous speakers who said that what happens in another jurisdiction is none of our business. I have been interested all my life in human rights and defining them universally. What happens in other jurisdictions is our business. For example, it is our business if a pregnant woman in Afghanistan dies because the religious fundamentalists there refuse to allow a male doctor give her assistance. The rights of women everywhere are our business. What happens to women, children and men in any other jurisdiction is our business. In terms of the difficult case, having made a mockery of the Constitution and scandalously distorting the relationship between it and the role of the Legislature, it is typical that some then say it is fine as long as the woman is heading out of the country. There is a notion that this is fine because there are so few cases. If there are so few, why have a referendum? Why not legislate to deal with them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that somebody promised someone a referendum. I have been through many referenda and recall the type of letters I received in the past. One of the reasons I called a quorum earlier is that I remember from previous discussions on these matters how wounding and awful it must be for the women involved. A previous referendum on divorce was rejected, not for any social, ethical or republican reasons, but on the basis of property rights. When it fell I remember thinking of all the women who had described their personal circumstances, but received a comprehensive slap in the face. Nevertheless, they had to continue on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those debates, and in this one to some extent, one did not hear much about the responsibility of relationships. This aspect is interesting because the people who sent postcards to me are the same people who tried to block sex education <Col N="99" />in schools. They were in favour of a discussion of relationships in the education system provided it had nothing to do with sex. These people also opposed other moves, such as giving advice to children at risk about what they should do to protect themselves. It must be wonderful to live in a world of certainties where one hardly needs to look at one's body at all and where all relationships are in some etherised space with certainty. In that world everything is black and white.</P>
    <P>One should think, however, of how much Irish history would have been different if proper social responsibility had been inculcated in men and women. I remember 1974-75 when I spoke in the Seanad. I recall the strong farmer coming up for a night at the dogs and to impregnate a woman and how upset he would be if he was reminded of the responsibility involved in bringing an unwanted child into the world, a child who would be slapped into an institution that could be described in Dostoevskian terms. This is one of the scandals of republican Ireland. They turned their eyes away, leaving the children there to be abused. When it was uncovered in one report after another they buried the reports and lost the files in the Department. This is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>This is not a country where all children are cherished equally, where every act that could bring a child into existence could be regarded as one of love. It is not a country which encourages responsibility. Fundamentalist thinking has stood in the way of proper education in schools in the same way as it did regarding the original proposals in the mother and child scheme 50 years ago. This scheme would have protected the mother and child from the moment of pregnancy up to the age of 12 years, but it was shot down by an act of fundamentalism and gutless cowardice and interference by the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Bill is nothing heroic. It is seedy and abject. It arose from a half promise; it was fixed up. The attitude is that it can be thrown into the Constitution because the Constitution does not matter any more. How can anybody who believes in the sovereignty of the division of powers in terms of the balance between the President, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Administration agree with it? We should remember that not only does it imply that we distrust ourselves and are incapable of legislating, but it suggests that future legislators in the House must have their hands tied because they cannot be trusted either. The result is to put a spancel on the hands of legislators.</P>
    <P>If one thinks of legislation in the future in accordance with medical practice or changing scientific opinion, one will have no right to introduce it. Legislators who vote for the Bill that enables this referendum to take place are damaging the integrity of their own profession. The Bill implies that legislators today and in the future cannot be trusted. It also states that women cannot be trusted. It was suggested on the Govern<Col N="100" />ment benches that a woman would affect proneness to suicide. That tells me much more about the Deputies who said it than it does about women. How many such cases have arisen? Where is the proof for their statement? I was a sociologist for 25 years and know that being prone to suicide is a very serious matter. It can be engaged with professionally; it is not invented. The Taoiseach, in his wisdom and in the little breaks he took apart from soccer, came to the conclusion that allowing the suicide ground would somehow set us down the slippery slope to what he calls social abortion. From where did he get that nonsense? It is another cheap justification for what is, in fact, a seedy exercise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the consensus, however late for so many, that we should do everything possible to assist those experiencing what is for them a crisis pregnancy. We agree on this and should not be mealy-mouthed about it. If the Government wants to put resources into that area, I pay tribute to it, the commission which suggested it and everybody involved in it. This is the way forward. It will be good to have an agency that is not censorious. We should remember the assumptions that guided all the practice up to now, such as &ldquo;the fallen woman.&rdquo;  Such women headed for the laundry and some did not come out again for 20 or 30 years. If their pregnancies went to full term, their children were taken away from them. Holy people &ndash; again, wonderful absolutists &ndash; said they must not even know where their children had gone and should put them out of their minds. This was the experience in Ireland and it is not over yet. The wounded are all around us.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that a change can be made to the Constitution in relation to legislation that will be passed later. How can the Minister of State square the existing Article 40.3.3º with the two new sections? I am not a lawyer, but, with the greatest respect, they are not consistent with each other. Perhaps the Minister of State could also tell us how the Government arrived at a penalty of 12 years for a woman who takes one of the non-allowed termination procedures and also how it arrived at the other penalties. Who gave the Government that figure? Who suggested there was a benefit in criminalising a woman in this manner? There is nothing republican about that move.</P>
    <P>There are other minor points in the context of the sloppy way the legislation is drafted. One presumes from the text that it does not only apply to doctors who are registered medical practitioners. It appears it will not apply at all to non-registered medical practitioners, which is interesting. I want to refer to the suggestion by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, that what happens in another jurisdiction does not matter. That was de Valera's view before the Commission on Emigration, 1948 to 1951, was set up. Prior to its establishment, de Valera comprehensively ignored Irish people who were forced to go to England. What happens in other jurisdictions is our business. What right has the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, to tell Irish citizens <Col N="101" />they must travel to another jurisdiction in conditions of total uncertainty, over which they have no control, to seek a resolution of their problems?</P>
    <P>I find the absence of trust at the heart of this proposal very interesting &ndash; an absence of trust in a woman who is likely to lie and say she is inclined towards suicide, an absence of trust in the Legislature or current or future legislators, an absence of trust in doctors and an absence of trust in the Constitution. Doctors and medical practitioners made their views clear. They said &ldquo;legislate and get on with it&rdquo;. That is what a real Government would have done. This Government, however, did the hucksters deal which meant it had to have the brand name of the absolutists on its actions. I sincerely hope these advocates will preface all their public comment on this issue by saying they were always in favour of helping women in these situations. I will then be able to look them in the eye and tell them that is untrue.</P>
    <P>Institutions were packed with children who were abandoned to conditions which the Government of the day would not monitor. Why? Because it was more moral and worthy to choose not to know than to become engaged or involved. Men and women need a commitment to responsibility in their relationships. A woman undergoing a very distressing and difficult period needs compassion. She needs to be able to listen to a doctor's advice and to have all the options made available to her. She does not need to be told that some of the options are only available at the very earliest stages and, even following an act of violence, will get her 12 years in jail. Do not insult my intelligence by suggesting there is anything wonderfully caring about that.</P>
    <P>The Government has come up with this little seedy sideways arrangement because it is too gutless to legislate for this matter. Members of the public will have a long time to consider this issue because there will be no rush to put this to the people other than from the fundamentalist wing of Fianna Fáil who will thump their breasts and operate like political mullahs throughout the country. The public, which is very decent in regard to these issues, has moved on, if the experience of my clinics is anything to go by, and this will show in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Members of this House must sometimes stand up for certain issues because they are personally important to them. I respect people who hold a different view from me on this issue and distinguish between them and some of the people I have spoken about. I respect the views of people whose construction of the moment at which life begins, for example, leads them to a set of conclusions which they must follow in their politics. Unfortunately, previous campaigns were characterised by people who sought to impose their certainties in a situation which requires sensitivity and respect for complexity. I would not have the courage, which most theologians have lacked but which the Government obviously has, to define so precisely the moment of implantation from <Col N="102" />which protection will begin and after which certain courses of action will be allowed or disallowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, for three main reasons. First, it represents a serious attempt to come to grips with a very complex and sensitive issue in a forthright manner which confronts the real problems everyone agrees exist. We are not running away from these problems, nor are we seeking to make political capital out of them. Second, the Bill represents the culmination of an exemplary process of participatory democracy with consultation of the widest kind ever undertaken over several years which offered a variety of opportunities to people of all shades of opinion to have their views entered into the deliberative process. Everyone has taken the process seriously and it is now our turn, as legislators, to do likewise. People rightly expect this of us. Third, the Bill is based on a sustained effort to identify and build on the areas of consensus in the medical profession, among psychiatrists and in the general public.</P>
      <P>This proposal represents an effort in good faith to address the difficult questions raised by crisis pregnancy and the unsatisfactory aftermath of the X case rulings. Given the sensitive nature of this issue, I hope the debate on this Bill will not be characterised by political rancour. We should give each other the space necessary to express our differing points of view and I hope the reasoned argument and temperate tone which, for the most part, has been adopted in this House will continue outside it. The challenge for Oireachtas Members is to talk through our differences on this vital issue with mutual respect with a view to working together to find real and practical solutions to the problems associated with crisis pregnancy.</P>
      <P>As legislators, we have a grave obligation to underpin in law the constitutional guarantees given in Article 40.3.3º which states: &ldquo;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo;  This article sets legislators a difficult challenge, namely, to enact laws which give real legal effect to the guarantees of protection for the mother and the unborn. While we may not relish the prospect of addressing these issues, we were not elected to this House merely to do that which is easy or pleasant. We have a job to do and the people who elected us want us to do it even where, indeed especially where, it is difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oireachtas Members will not forget the passage of the X case rulings in which a member of the Supreme Court excoriated the Oireachtas for failing to enact the laws called for by Article 40.3.3º. This issue is unfinished business and this <Col N="103" />Bill tackles the most difficult aspect of it, namely, finding a formula of words which, on the one hand, safeguards the lawfulness of essential medical treatment needed to preserve the life of the mother which unavoidably results in the death of the unborn while, on the other hand, making abortion unlawful. I support the Bill because I believe it makes a genuine, imaginative and original effort to do just that. The wording has achieved the right balance and it is time for us as legislators to grasp the nettle and finish the unfinished business of Article 40.3.3º by enacting a law which finds the right balance between the legal protection of the mother and the unborn.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach undertook to refer this issue to the people following a process of consultation, nobody could have foreseen the extent of the public's participation in the process. Tens of thousands of submissions were made by experts and ordinary people from all walks of life, reflecting a huge range of different approaches. The extent of the public's participation in the process of consultation sent the very important message to this House that they consider this to be a matter of utmost importance and demand that we treat it with responsibility and gravity.</P>
    <P>In other countries, abortion has been introduced by the courts or by Parliament, with little or no public participation in the debate. As was stated at the Oireachtas hearings on this issue, nothing has taken place anywhere in the world comparable to the process of consultation in Ireland. It is a sign of the healthy and vigorous state of Irish democracy.</P>
    <P>A crisis pregnancy is a crisis for two reasons, because a woman needs considerable help and support to cope with it if she is to feel able to have her child and because having an abortion is a terrible option for a woman. If abortion were not such a serious matter, she would not dread having to undergo it. Foreign commentators who have spoken to people in Ireland about this issue have remarked on the unanimity of those on both sides who believe that abortion is a terribly difficult choice. This is an important part of the consensus in Ireland. There is almost universal agreement here that abortion is a terrible option and that we have failed a woman in a fundamental way if she feels she has no option but to have an abortion. We have abandoned such women.</P>
    <P>The positive side of the consensus is the broad public support for the establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency. The agency will deliver a wide range of practical supports so that women facing crisis pregnancy feel they have real and positive alternatives to abortion. When calls are made for abortion as a way of confronting the reality of crisis pregnancy, we may forget to reflect on the enormity of the practice of abortion in other countries. Abortion on demand inevitably follows from the introduction of abortion. In Britain, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks and up to birth in cases of foetal disability.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the advantage of being able to look <Col N="104" />to other jurisdictions where abortion has been introduced in recent decades. Having surveyed the effects of these policies, can we really say that crisis pregnancy is confronted in a manner that addresses the needs of women with unexpected pregnancies and respects the right to life of the unborn child? Recent figures show that 6,000 or perhaps close to 7,000 Irish women seek abortions in Britain, which is a tragically high figure, although low in British or EU terms. There is every reason to be optimistic about the prospects of slowing or reversing this trend.</P>
    <P>A study by Evelyn Mahon of Trinity College Dublin into crisis pregnancy identified a number of problem areas that prompt women to seek abortion. By addressing these problems, we can give women real alternatives to abortion. As it becomes ever more widely perceived that these supports are in place and are adequate, an increasing number of women will choose to avail of them.</P>
    <P>We need to keep in mind what makes abortion such a uniquely sensitive issue. The reason it is so terrible for a woman is that it involves her in the loss of the unborn life she is carrying. If another life were not involved, the choice would not be so fraught, with the risk of emotional hurt and harm. As legislators, we should approach the issue with maturity and responsibility. Article 40.3.3º places on us the obligation of devising a law that protects &ldquo;the right to life of the unborn&rdquo;, &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;. Our task has been made more difficult by the X case judgment which restricted the protection offered to the unborn and ruled that a threat of suicide grounded a right to abortion without medical evidence. It falls to us as legislators to take the next step in redressing the legal situation left by that judgment.</P>
    <P>The abortion right created in the X case judgment has no time limit, meaning that abortion is allowable up to and during birth. No medical evidence of any kind is required. The threat of suicide triggers a right to abortion, effectively facilitating abortion on demand. Nobody who shares the broad consensus identified at the oral hearings can stand over such a situation with their hand on their heart. The Government's proposal is an honest effort to find a meaningful and workable solution to the issue, after exhaustive deliberations. I ask people to recognise the situation that exists and I ask them to support fully this proposal.</P>
    <P>The oral hearings heard expert evidence from a number of psychiatrists who made it clear that abortion is not indicated medically and psychiatrically in cases of depression and suicidal inclination. A Finnish study was quoted, which showed a significantly high incidence of suicide among those who had an abortion compared with those who had given birth. The study looked at women of child-bearing age who committed suicide. Specifically, it compared the number of women who committed suicide after having a baby and the number of women who did so after <Col N="105" />having an abortion. It was found that the number of women who committed suicide after having a child was half the number of women of child-bearing age without a child who did so. The number of women who committed suicide after having an abortion was almost six times the number of those who had given birth. Having a baby was strongly linked to a lower rate of suicide and having an abortion was strongly linked with a significantly higher rate of suicide. As legislators, we should not disregard this expert testimony as we have a clear and compelling obligation to take it on board.</P>
    <P>With all other Members, I have compassion and sympathy with women who feel that the only alternative to going through a crisis pregnancy is suicide. Equally, I believe that taking the life of the unborn is not the solution to this problem. I am satisfied that the removal of the suicide ground in the Government's proposal is in line with the consensus of psychiatric evidence presented at the oral hearings. It is the right way to deal with this element of the rulings in the X case.</P>
    <P>The most difficult task facing the drafters of this proposal was to strike a balance between banning abortion and safeguarding the lawful availability of the medical treatment needed to preserve the mother's life, which may unavoidably lead to the death of the unborn. The balance has been successfully reached. The turning point in the process was a letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, submitted to the all-party committee in response to a request from Deputy Brian Lenihan. For the first time, the letter articulated the consensus among obstetricians and gynaecologists concerning the most difficult medical conditions that impact on pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution was passed by the people, to whom the final say concerning questions of national policy rests, according to Article 6 of the Constitution. Article 40.3.3º requires the Oireachtas to enact laws to embody the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn, as far as practicable. The Constitution contains the two-patient model of pregnancy that has always informed the ethos of Irish medicine. A doctor treating a pregnant woman has not one but two patients, as he has to look out for both mother and baby. Article 40.3.3º provides a secure legal foundation for current ethical medical practice.</P>
    <P>Unlike British abortion law, which makes abortion a crime and defines medical treatment where the unborn life is lost as a form of abortion, the 25th amendment of the Constitution will make legal history, by distinguishing between abortion and medical treatment where the baby's life is lost as a result of treatment needed to save the mother's life. The central passage in the letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is the template for the approach that followed in the Government's proposal. The institute saw a fundamental difference between <Col N="106" />abortion carried out with the intention of taking the life of the baby, for example, as social abortion, and the unavoidable death of the baby, resulting from essential treatment to protect the life of the mother. The proposed constitutional amendment is based on the fundamental difference between abortion and treatment mentioned in the letter sent by the obstetricians and gynaecologists.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal does not redefine the beginning of life. It has nothing to say about life prior to implantation or treatment of the human embryo. These stages of human existence remain protected by Article 40.3.3º and this measure does not affect that. The passage of this Bill will not prevent measures which seek to protect unborn life at earlier stages from being introduced in the future. Legislation in relation to embryo research may be introduced, for example. It is important we acknowledge that this wording draws a legal line between abortion and medical treatment to protect the life of the mother, unavoidably resulting in the death of the unborn, for the first time. At the same time, it reverses the legal effects of the X ruling, which lessened the protection which the people wanted Article 40.3.3º to give to the unborn.</P>
    <P>To restore the proper degree of protection to the unborn while at the same time protecting the life of the mother, the X ruling needed to be reversed. This Bill's proposed amendment does this in two stages. It excludes the threat of suicide as a ground for abortion in line with the psychiatrist's evidence presented at the oral hearings and it obliges the doctor, when working to preserve the life of the mother, to have regard also to the duty to preserve the life of the unborn, as far as practicable. It is because it manages to do all these things at the same time that I am confident that it will win the approval of the people as an honest attempt to put right the legal situation left in the wake of the 1992 Supreme Court ruling.</P>
    <P>This legislation and proposed amendment is unique in that it refers legislation for support in the Constitution to the people. It refers it to the people who voted in 1992 and 1993. They are entitled to the opportunity to give their direct voice to this proposal which displays the sensitive, understanding and compassionate response required from all of us.</P>

      <P>I share the views expressed by the Taoiseach that we must strive to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancies. I agree with him that the Constitution and the law are only part of the picture and that education, advice, care and compassion are often more important. I also share the view that it is essential that any debate on this issue should be conducted in a reasonable, calm and structured way so as to avoid division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe represented our party on the all-party committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the issue of abortion. The Fine Gael proposal to protect women in crisis preg<Col N="107" />nancies has been accepted by all parties in the House. I thank Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Gay Mitchell who, in Private Members' time, brought forward a Bill to ensure that an agency would be established to assist women in crisis pregnancies. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has set up such an agency and I hope that Ms Olive Braiden and her staff will be successful. It is of more practical compassionate import to assist women who feel that, for one reason or other, they cannot carry a pregnancy to full term than to be involved in many of the controversial issues debated inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that Fine Gael has moved a reasoned amendment the main purpose of which is to give the Government additional time to reconsider the very complex issues raised, to give it the opportunity to bring forward clarification and to remove uncertainties. When the proposal was announced the Taoiseach wrote to me and said that he would provide any additional information or clarification I sought. I took up this offer and the Taoiseach replied to a series of questions I put to him, and I thank him for that. While these replies were helpful the Taoiseach will not be surprised to hear that his responses raise almost as many questions again.</P>
    <P>The topic we are dealing with is complex. It has already, in our generation, engaged the best and brightest advice available to us in this country and indeed in other jurisdictions also. It is fair to say that no one has yet found a solution which commands widespread consensus, support and respect. So far in this debate the one thing that can be said about this proposal is that it has not yet established or commanded such support or respect.</P>
    <P>I have some personal experience of this. I spoke on Second Stage of the 1983 amendment debate as the then Minister for Justice. I very specifically drew attention to the ambiguous nature of the eighth amendment. I indicated that it would have unforeseen and unforeseeable consequences. While there were those who disagreed with and criticised this view, experience indicates that what I said proved correct. I give precisely the same warning regarding this legislation. It is ambiguous and uncertain and its results are unforeseeable. It creates a new category of hybrid 'constitutional legislation'. It does violence to the fundamental balance between the institutions of Government and the courts as laid down not only under the 1937 Constitution but also under our first Constitution. This proposal is built on a foundation of corrosive mistrust.</P>
    <P>The Dáil cannot be trusted so a Bill enacted by the Dáil must be enshrined in the Constitution so that it cannot be amended in this House by reference to the people. That is basically a vote of mistrust in the Dáil itself. The courts cannot be trusted either so this legislation has to be enshrined in the Constitution so that the traditional protection which the Supreme Court gives <Col N="108" />to legislation which it deems to be in accordance with the Constitution is also removed. I suggest also that the medium and long-term proposal suggests that the people themselves may not be trusted in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that in the foreseeable future a substantive majority will ever favour the introduction of legalised abortion. I believe that views in the medical profession are substantially against the introduction of legalised abortion. I refer not only to the medical profession but also to those engaged in nursing and other health professionals. I fail to see from where the threat to introduce legalised abortion in this jurisdiction is coming?</P>
    <P>My main objection to the proposal is that it is riddled with uncertainty. I will examine this from the standpoint addressed by many members of the pro-life movement. The classical pro-life position protects life from the point of conception. This legislation studiously and consciously ignores the entire area of conception from fertilisation to implantation in the womb. As the Minister for Health and Children said at the launch of the proposal &ldquo;The proposals have no relevance to the unborn outside the womb.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has always been accepted, even by opponents of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, that the protection afforded by it is from the moment of conception. There is no definition of unborn in the Constitution, but no one has ever cast doubt on the proposition that the intention of 40.3.3º is to protect life from conception. The definition of abortion in the Bill before the House means &ldquo;the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of the woman&rdquo;. Therefore, the protection under this proposed act given to the unborn is from implantation, not from conception. This, it seems, sets up a conflict between two subsections of the new Article 40 of the Constitution and this conflict may only be resolved by a decision, in due course, of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On one hand, Article 40.3.3º protects life from the moment of conception. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, repeated that and said that protection would not be removed. At the same time this Bill will only vindicate that right from the time of implantation. It seems that is putting a contradiction into Article 40 and the Supreme Court of the day in the future will adjudicate on that. Frankly, I cannot predict what the consequence of that adjudication will be. It surely opens a vista of uncertainty greater than the vista of uncertainty to which I brought the attention of the House when the amendment of 1983 was put before the House</P>
    <P>There is a misunderstanding about the role of the Supreme Court in respect of the proposals before the House. Because legislation is being enshrined in the Constitution the Supreme Court cannot intervene to deem it unconstitutional. This cannot be referred to the Supreme Court by the President in accordance with the provisions of Article 29, but the fact that the Supreme Court is <Col N="109" />not in a position to strike down the legislation on constitutional grounds does not mean that it is not free subsequently to interpret it in just the same way as it would interpret any other section of the Constitution. This Bill, if the referendum is passed by the people, will become an integral part of Article 40 of the Constitution and be subject to the full scrutiny of the Supreme Court on a case stated, on any issue which runs from those contained in Article 40.</P>
    <P>The justification for the Government's rather odd definition of abortion seems to be to save the use of the IUD and morning after pill from legal challenge. Medical dictionaries define abortion in terms of the termination of a pregnancy before term. It is never defined in terms of the termination of a pregnancy after conception or after implantation. The same is true of normal parlance. One thinks of abortion as the termination of a pregnancy before the birth of the child &ndash; before the child goes to term.</P>

      <P>The Government's definition is an odd one. This oddity is explained in the press statements by the Government when the proposals were announced. The Government justifies it in an attempt to save the use of IUDs and the morning after pill from legal challenge.</P>
      <P>As a result of events yesterday, this exercise may have been unnecessary. Yesterday the Irish Medicines Board took decisions that will result in approval of the sale of Levonelle, a type of morning after pill. According to a spokesperson for the IMB the decision was made &ldquo;in consultation with&rdquo; the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecolgists and a senior counsel who examined the matter for the board. The IMB refused to sanction this product about six months ago, but has done so now on the grounds that it is a contraceptive rather that an abortifacient.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecolgists seems to have no ethical problem with this decision. The institute advised the IMB that it was appropriate to sanction this in due course for sale in Ireland. The eminent legal counsel retained by the IMB is of the view that the use of Levonelle is in accordance with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution. Why, therefore, does the Government believe that it needs to include a non-medical and decidedly odd definition of abortion in this Bill to save the use of the morning after pill when it is under no threat from either the medical profession or legal opinion? </P>
      <P>There are, of course, chemical abortifacients which act after implantation. It is possible to envisage a case being stated which would go all the way to the Supreme Court on the use of these products, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty how a Supreme Court might decide on whether such products acting in or around or shortly after the time of implantation would be legal in this jurisdiction. This shows the level of uncertainty that emerges when one examines these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" />The proposed Bill will allow a medical practitioner to terminate a pregnancy if he forms &ldquo;a reasonable opinion&rdquo; that the termination is necessary to &ldquo;prevent a real and substantial risk of the loss of a woman's life other than by self destruction.&rdquo; If a medical practitioner were to terminate a pregnancy for any other reason, he would be liable to the criminal penalties under the Bill. It is not the criminal sanctions, however, which will primarily regulate the grounds on which terminations will be carried out by medical practitioners, it is the ethical code of the Medical Council which will regulate this in practice. Medical practitioners who transgress this code may be removed from the medical register. We know of examples where they have been so removed.</P>
    <P>I have the highest respect for the medical profession and its code of practice. It has served us well in both medical and ethical matters. We know, however, from divisions within the council earlier this year that its code of practice may change. It has changed in the last 12 months and could change again in the future. This adds a further uncertainty to the proposal, because the grounds for termination are founded on a code of practice which may change and without reference to the Oireachtas or the people. It can be done internally within the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>The X case has become central to this debate. I have reread the judgments in the case and the House may be interested to note that, at least, one Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice McCarthy, suggested that the real and substantial risk to the life of a mother which would permit termination of pregnancy under Article 40.3.3 need not be an immediate risk. Mr. Justice Hamilton, the Chief Justice, had a different view. He said the risk had to be immediate, but Mr. Justice McCarthy stated clearly that it need not be.</P>
    <P>If a medical practitioner on the enactment of this legislation were to form a reasonable opinion that a risk to the life of a mother was real and substantial, though not immediate, could not a future Supreme Court uphold that decision and would not this provide for abortion on a much wider basis than envisaged by the Government or anyone else in this House? I do not exaggerate the position when I say that what one Supreme Court judge might state in a judgment in one set of circumstances could easily become the majority view in another set of circumstances in a subsequent Supreme Court decision by the same or different individuals. It is this kind of unforeseen circumstance leading to a decision of the Supreme Court which has caused difficulty in the past. This is what happened in the X case, to the surprise of the strong supporters of the amendment of 1983.</P>
    <P>It is not a sentence or a phrase, but a whole Bill that is now being grafted on to the Constitution, and the grounds on which the Supreme Court can adjudicate have been significantly widened and increased. I defy any Minister to state <Col N="112" />with certainty what the consequences of this in all circumstances may be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell who is taking this debate on behalf of Fine Gael has argued very strongly that the powers vested in Ministers to change the manner in which the Bill operates create further uncertainty. Places where terminations may take place may be designated from time to time and the obligation to keep records may be altered by ministerial order. I agree with what he says and have nothing to add. However, taken with all the other uncertainties and ambiguities, this is another serious flaw in the proposal. A Minister may change the circumstances in which terminations may take place, but if the House seeks to amend the legislation, even if a technical flaw is discovered, it must go to the people.</P>
    <P>I cannot summarise the ambiguities behind the Bill any better than to quote the Taoiseach's reply to some of my questions:</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's intention to resolve the ongoing ethical debate as to whether procedures referred to in section 1(2) of the envisaged legislation amount to legal abortion or to termination. It is not the Government's intention to define what the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; means in the Constitution. It is not the Government's intention to define the point at which a &ldquo;distinct human person comes into existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach rightly says that all these issues are the subject of philosophical, moral and theological discourse, but they are not only the subject of such discourse, they are also the subject of legal discourse and central to what a Supreme Court in the future will or may decide. It is not possible to predict now how it may deal with these issues. The ambiguities, doubts and grey areas will cause us as much difficulty, emotional conflict and anxiety in the future as was caused by the X case and the C case.</P>
    <P> In presenting the Government's proposal the Taoiseach made much of the fact that this was, yet again, an attempt to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case. I appreciate fully the legal implications of that judgment, but it is important to bring a sense of reality to bear on the situation. In the nine years since the Supreme Court case the one thing that can be said with certainty is that the prediction that the X case would open the floodgates to abortion was incorrect. The X case was followed by the C case, there may have been others, but if there were, I have not heard of them.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the ambiguity of these proposals the Government has resolutely faced in both directions as to whether the proposal brought forward is reconcilable with Protocol 17 of the Maastricht treaty. The protocol provides: &ldquo;Nothing in the Treaty of the European Union, nor in the treaties establishing the European Communities or the treaties or Acts modifying or supplementing these treaties, shall effect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º of the <Col N="113" />Constitution of Ireland.&rdquo;  Clearly, the protocol does not restrict Ireland's power unilaterally to amend Article 40.3.3º, but that is not my point. However, in the third edition of <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J. M. Kelly, Gerard Hogan points out: &ldquo;It is by no means clear that such unilateral amendment would automatically obtain the benefit of the immunity from EC law provided by the protocol as it is arguable that the reference to Article 40.3.3º in the protocol is a reference to that provision as it stood on 7 February 1992, the date on which the treaty on the European Union was signed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is easy to envisage a conflict emerging between European and Irish law in this area. We know that abortion has been defined as a service under Article 60 of the treaty. What would be the situation if an effort is made to prosecute a person selling the contraceptive RU486 from outside this jurisdiction to consumers within this jurisdiction? I use the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; not to make light of the issue, but because it has been defined as a service and that is the parlance in which it will be dealt with in Europe. Is this form of contraception intended to be banned or not under the legislation and if it is to be banned, how will the Government ensure such cross-border sales within the European Union can be effectively prohibited?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the House is aware, but I understand it is possible to access points of sale of contraceptive RU486 on the Internet and to purchase such chemical contraceptives with a credit card. Does the Government intend to take steps to prohibit the importation of contraceptive RU486 when this Bill is enacted? If it does, has it worked out its defence to a challenge, which could go as far as the European Court of Justice? I do not know what is the Government's intention, but this illustrates the point that it has not clarified the inter-relationship between its proposal and the protocol to the Maastricht treaty. This adds further uncertainty to the proposal.</P>
    <P>I spare the Taoiseach the question of what precisely is the state of European law in relation to fundamental rights which may emerge in the introduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, now the subject matter of discussion. How would effect be given to rights to life, to health and protection to the rights of mothers and children by the European Court of Justice in the context of a more general human rights jurisdiction? Perhaps the Taoiseach will address this aspect in due course.</P>
    <P>If a differentiation is being made between conception and implantation, a series of issues arise in relation to IVF treatment and embryo and stem cell research. If, on the one hand, the Government maintains that Article 40.3.3º still protects human life from conception, that gives rise to one set of circumstances, but if, on the other, the protection is only going to be vindicated from implantation, we have another set of circumstances, which, in terms of IVF treatment, <Col N="114" />embryo and stem cell research, will put existing practice on its head.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, we could have a far more unsatisfactory situation than the one we have today. There will be greater uncertainty and ambiguity. Fine Gael is trying to deal with this issue reasonably and moderately because we do not want division. We are asking the Government to give itself more time &ndash; another three months &ndash; to resolve the difficulties which have been brought to its attention, including by many whom the Government expected to support the referendum. I have outlined the main ambiguities and drawn attention to possible uncertain and unforeseeable consequences, whether coming from the courts, the Medical Council or the European Union.</P>
    <P>We have much experience on this issue and know the traps and dangers of ambiguity and unforeseen consequences. The Minister should accept the reasoned amendment by the Fine Gael Party when this reading is put to a vote, either tonight or next week. The Government should give itself the time to resolve the issue. If it intends to return to the House with a fuller proposal, it should, at least, give itself time to remove the uncertainties, ambiguities and unforeseen circumstances obvious to those who analyse and think about it for any reasonable length of time.</P>

    <P>Deputy Noonan raised many questions which no doubt should be teased out fully on Committee and Report Stages. It is a difficult issue. Crisis pregnancies cause great stress and mothers expecting a child in such a situation are under great pressure. The issue is how we as a society think it is best to address such cases.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a fundamental difference between the ruling of the Supreme Court in the X case and actual medical practice. This has persisted for some time and we would be in abrogation of our duty if we did not try to reconcile them one way or another. The proposal on which the people will adjudicate is an honest attempt so they can decide whether they want to preserve current medical practice and make sure the Constitution and the law match the practice or to introduce a medical practice which would inevitably lead to the abortion regimes we see in other countries. At its starkest that is the proposition which will be put to the people and it will be up to them to decide. Various details have been raised and no doubt they will be teased out on the floor of the House, as they should be, but I am happy this is a comprehensive and honest attempt to crystallise the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan queried the mechanism being used, and I agree it is an unusual mechanism to use in the Constitution. However, in the circumstances of the debate over the past ten years it is reasonable as time and again we were told this matter could not be put in a crystal clear manner <Col N="116" />to the people in the form of a three or four line amendment to the Constitution. The people desire to be given a choice and to be as clear as possible in such a complicated issue in terms of what they are choosing. Therefore, the approach, novel though it is, is good and reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Noonan say we should put the matter back further. I have not seen an issue given more comprehensive debate, thought, time and consultation, particularly since the Government came to power. There are obviously fundamental differences of opinion on the issue, and I recognise them and accept they are dearly held by people who have differing views. They will not be reconciled and all we can do on the two sides of that fundamental difference of opinion is accept the will of the people. The circle cannot be squared between those who think the medical regime we have is the right one and those who believe that an abortion regime similar to that which pertains in many other countries should be introduced here.</P>
    <P>Other issues will have to be tackled in future, including that of the unborn outside the womb, but they are matters for another day and I understand they are currently being examined. I do not think it necessary to deal with those issues ahead of the discussions and consultations taking place on them. They are causing great concern and debate in this and other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>At times I am puzzled by the use of terminology. It is difficult because of the huge level of emotion to get involved in a debate about words and terminology. One of the great problems of the debate was that many meanings were given to the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;&ndash; some people include in its definition spontaneous abortion while others include medical treatments which most doctors would not consider to be abortion &ndash; and from a legal point of view it was necessary to define abortion. The use of the term &ldquo;termination&rdquo; also causes great confusion. Deputy Noonan was very interested in dictionary definitions, and to me &ldquo;to terminate&rdquo; means to finish, to complete.</P>
    <P>I once asked an eminent gynaecologist whether there was any particular medical terminology for &ldquo;termination&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I eventually found out that the word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; was lifted from a British Act of Parliament and introduced in common parlance here without having its origin explained.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to be facetious, the Opposition has been making great play of small points and possible ambiguities while itself using huge ambiguities. Every pregnancy terminates, and many are terminated by way of medical intervention before the natural completion of the gestation period. Therefore, the word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; on its own does not explain and is an obfuscation of what the debate is about. The Bill deals clearly with this issue. I have been accused of many things during this debate but I have not heard anyone say that if the mother's life could not be <Col N="117" />saved by some means &ndash; an ectopic pregnancy is a good example &ndash; other than by the removal of the foetus, the pregnancy should not finish by way of medical intervention. However, the difference arises if a pregnancy is terminated and the unborn is viable. This legislation puts the obligation on the medical practitioner to try to save and sustain the baby.</P>
    <P>To my layman's way of thinking, this is the fundamental difference between abortion as we know it throughout the world and current medical practice in this country. At all times all medical practitioners here make sure the life of the mother is sustained but, as far as practicable in all circumstances, they do so with the dual purpose of trying to ensure that the life of the unborn is also sustained. While abortion as we know it in common terms is about the deliberate destruction of the unborn, the legislation before us seeks to get away from this loose terminology and arrive at a clear definition so that these two fundamental differences are recognised.</P>
    <P>I recall a number of years ago a question being asked in the Dáil by a then Opposition Deputy in regard to maternal deaths as a result of pregnancy in Ireland compared to other European Union countries. One thing that became clear, aside from deaths caused while abortions were being carried out, was that, thanks be to God, pregnant women in Ireland were safer than in other European Union countries. No one in Ireland who cares about this issue would put a woman's life unnecessarily at risk. An objective of all of us is to honestly say this is the safest country not just in Europe but in the world for a woman to be expecting a child, and that is something towards which we all work and aspire. It seems from the figures given that there is no medical evidence to show that the introduction of social abortion in any way moves us from that point. The opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to hear Deputy Noonan refer to EU law and the protocol to the treaty because I raised that issue to the consternation of my colleagues in the parliamentary party when I read the protocol as protecting Article 40.3.3WP extended char 6,36 as it was, and, therefore, in the event of a further referendum perhaps not covering the situation. Many Opposition Members at the time thought I was losing the run of myself. These people would not listen to the point I was trying to make and were quick to brand me as a whole lot of things. However, when the Government of the day, led by Deputy Albert Reynolds, went to the European Union and got the solemn declaration, which is mentioned in the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Noonan, I was satisfied &ndash; I am still satisfied &ndash; to trust the member states of the European Union in that undertaking that whatever we decide on this issue will be respected by the European institutions. I am absolutely amazed that almost ten years later those who scoff use this as another reason it is not a good proposal. I am still willing to accept their good faith on that issue.</P>
    <P>After ten years it is about time to take our <Col N="118" />courage in our hands in this House and go to the people, after what has been a long period of consultation, with what is a very comprehensive, balanced and good proposal. There are those who do not favour it because they would prefer a different regime. I cannot understand why these people do not favour holding a referendum or why they cannot come up with a better proposal after all this time. As I said at the beginning, for the first time since the X case the people of Ireland will get a clear choice, that is, to vote for the preservation of current medical practice in Ireland or to vote against this proposition for the ruling given in the X case, which would, despite what Deputy Noonan says, inevitably lead to the introduction of social abortion similar to that which pertains in other European countries. The choice is stark. It should be put to the people and I look forward to the issue being decided by the people in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I want to focus on section 1(1) of the Bill on the definition of abortion. Abortion is defined in the legislation as terminating life after implantation rather than conception and that will lead to huge ethical problems in the not too distant future. The publication in February 2001 of the draft sequence of the human genome has set in motion a new area of genetic research which will have far-reaching implications. This milestone in scientific research brings with it huge potential to treat genetic disorders but also leads to complex ethical questions. This knowledge of the genetic make-up of human beings has implications for society's concepts of race, equality, disability and social responsibility. To date, the emotive debate surrounding this area of research has focused on human reproduction and, specifically, on assisted pregnancy and cloning. There is no legislative framework in this country to regulate either of these two areas, with only minimum guidance under the Irish Medical Council guidelines.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the constitutional right to life, under article 40.3.3WP extended char 6,36 provides protection in the area of assisted reproduction has not been answered. However, following the publication of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, any protection which may have prevailed in this area is removed, with the redefinition of the commencement of life as following implantation rather than conception itself. With this redefinition of life, there is now an urgent need to establish a regulatory framework in this area. Across the European Union, legislation ranges from the UK situation, where the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority regulates and licenses research and clinical practice in genetic technology involving embryos. The UK situation allows research on embryos and the creation of embryos for scientific research purposes under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation contrasts with the position in <Col N="119" />Austria and Germany where legislation is extremely restrictive. In Germany, embryo protection regulations are among the strictest in the world, forbidding research that harms the embryo or the production of embryos for any purpose other than to start a pregnancy. However, human embryo stem cell lines produced in other countries may be imported for research in Germany.</P>
    <P>While there are contrasting views on the level of embryo regulation throughout the EU, each country believes that this research must be regulated. It would be irresponsible to enact this Bill without reference to this background as this would lead to huge ethical problems in the near future. In Ireland, an ethical quandary currently surrounds the fate of unused embryos for use in <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation &ndash; IVF &ndash; programmes but there are other elements which must also be considered in relation to assisted reproduction. Assisted human reproduction or <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation, as it is commonly called, has been practised successfully in Ireland for many years. Shortly after the technology became available, clinics attached to maternity units were set up in some hospitals. Infertile couples in this country were as anxious to avail of the treatment as those in other countries. Many more clinics have been established in recent years, some of which are associated with clinics in the UK. There is no Irish legislation to control the establishment of such clinics or to regulate the procedures currently carried out in them. Senator Henry introduced a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad to put such regulation in place but, regrettably, the Government voted it down.</P>
    <P>Genetic information has vast potential to affect reproductive choice. Among the practices associated with genetics and reproduction are IVF programmes, embryo freezing, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis &ndash; PGD &ndash; enhancement gene therapy and cloning. Enhancement gene therapy has the ability to manipulate genes to influence the characteristics of a baby and this has given rise to as much public disquiet as cloning. Again, in Ireland there is no legislation either prohibiting or regulating genetics-related reproductive practices. The only regulation is under the voluntary guidelines of the IMO, which contains a general statement that gene manipulation with the aim of improvement of health may be ethical, while the creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. The lack of legislation in this regard has caused considerable concern for Ministers for Health for some years. The Medical Council guidelines are insufficient because they have no legal standing and many people involved in assisted human reproduction are not medical practitioners. They are either physiologists or other members of the scientific community who are not covered by those guidelines.</P>
    <P>IVF programmes, artificial insemination by anonymous donors and embryo freezing are currently practised in Ireland. Advances in genetic <Col N="120" />knowledge means that IVF programmes may allow the selection of embryos before they are implanted in the womb, which is called PGD. This raises the prospect of even fertile couples, where there is a risk passing on defective genes, deciding to opt for IVF to remove this risk. PGD also allows the possibility of selecting the sex of a foetus before it is implanted into the womb. In the UK, sex selection is banned except when justified for medical reasons.</P>
    <P>The other element of research is cloning. Concerns have been raised by the cloning of animals and, no doubt, most people have heard of Dolly the sheep. There are two distinct types of cloning, reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. Human reproductive cloning involves creating genetically identical foetuses, while therapeutic cloning involves cloning human embryo cells under two weeks old for the purposes of research into diseases such as Parkinson's disease, cancer, strokes, heart disease etc. Much of the revulsion to human cloning is based on the notion of human dignity and treating human life in an instrumental manner. The current state of scientific advances is such that cloning is extremely hazardous, with a success rate of between 3% and 5%. In Ireland, there is no regulation prohibiting or controlling either types of cloning.</P>
    <P>This is in contrast to most European states which have enacted legislation banning human reproductive cloning. In certain countries, such as Germany and Spain, an attempt at human cloning is a criminal offence. In Britain, cloning is regulated under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, 1990. Although there is no explicit ban on cloning in that legislation, it requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which has indicated that no such licence would be granted. Various international measures have been taken to outlaw reproductive cloning. Article 11 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights states: &ldquo;Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has passed a resolution calling on member states and the UN to implement a legally binding universal ban on human cloning. The European Parliament, in its resolution on human cloning, considers that there is no difference between cloning for therapeutic purposes and cloning for the purposes of reproduction and that the relaxation of the current ban will lead to pressure of further developments in embryo production and usage. Such therapeutic cloning irreversibly crosses a boundary in research norms and is contrary to public policy as adopted by the European Union.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament urged that maximum effort be aimed at therapies using stem cells taken from adult subjects. This is an area of research which has been developed for some years and has had some positive elements to it. National and Union authorities should ensure that the ban on patenting or cloning human beings is reaffirmed <Col N="121" />and that rules are adopted to that end. Again, we have no Irish laws on any of those matters, contrary to the policy stated by the European Parliament. For many years the United States has been torn apart by arguments about abortion. Anyone who has read up on that debate will be extremely conscious of how heated it has been. Abortion clinics have been bombed and there have been other violent actions by various fundamental organisations there. However, that paled into insignificance when compared with the debate held in the US this summer on a more complicated series of questions regarding stem cell research. This debate, which has taken up much of the time of the Congress and Senate, has covered the ethical aspects of stem cell research and whether it should be funded by the US Government.</P>
    <P>President Bush spent much of his summer agonising over whether to allow federal money to support research into stem cells that have been extracted from embryos. The House of Representatives voted for a Bill that would ban all forms of human cloning. Stem cells can be encouraged to grow into any sort of cell and thus prove invaluable in helping to find cures to diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Given that stem cells can be manipulated into any organ in the body, they form an extremely useful research tool.</P>
    <P>The US regulatory regime is in a complete mess. The US Government's only source of control is through the money it spends in funding research programmes. This gives considerable clout to industry. Its reluctance to spend money on stem cell research in the United States has persuaded many American scientists to carry out their research in the more liberal regime that exists in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>This still leaves scientists free to do pretty much what they want provided they use private money. The current lack of a regulatory framework means that a similar situation pertains here. The only regulation that exists relates to the Medical Council. As you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, know quite well, most of this research is carried out by scientists who do not have to abide by the guidelines set down by the Irish Medical Council or any other equivalent body. Furthermore, none of these scientists, either during their education or professional practice, have to address the issue of the ethical implications of research they do. It is not part of their training and it is a matter for Government to lay down the legislation and regulations to govern the research they carry out.</P>
    <P>In the US, due to the lack of regulations, private industry has carried out an immense amount of research with serious ethical implications. The same thing could in theory happen here and the protection which was available under the Constitution will now be removed under this legislation given the new definition of abortion.</P>
    <P>In the United States, one cult is trying to clone <Col N="122" />humans. A company recently announced plans to harvest embryos. Another company is offering a service to couples whereby they can choose the sex of their child &ndash; the list goes on.</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that this area is a mess without a legislative framework. We have the most lax system in the European Union because we have not been prepared to tackle the issue. To date, the only protection against the potential abuse of embryos has been under article 40.3.3WP extended char 6,36 of the Constitution. Even the legal interpretation of that protection has been in doubt for some time. There is no doubt that the legislation as it now stands, if passed, will remove that semblance of protection. The Government should take due consideration of that point before proceeding further with this legislation. I can guarantee that within 12 months of this legislation being passed, voted on by the people and written into the Constitution, there will be an even bigger lobby raising questions and looking for further legislation in the area of cloning and human reproduction.</P>
    <P>The protection of embryos, stem cell research, the use of stem cells for genetic manipulation and what we decide to do with the frozen embryos or zygotes which are stored in the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin are all open for debate. This debate will be at least as heated as the abortion debates here have been in the past. For years politicians in the United States knew on which side of the divide they were in the abortion debate. However, many of them do not know where to turn on this area because it is not a black and white issue. It is a grey area that will lead to huge complications.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed this is not being addressed by the Government through this legislation. It is a fundamental issue and to go ahead with the legislation without putting that protection or regulation in place is irresponsible, and it would be irresponsible for this House to approve that legislation.</P>
    <P>I therefore support my party's position that the passing of Second Stage be postponed until these very real issues, raised by me and my party leader, Deputy Noonan, are addressed by the Government. What we are doing is opening a further can of worms that will not lead to the solution that this Government expects.</P>

      <P>With some difficulty I found out at the beginning of this year that in my own county council area, South Dublin, last year a miserable total of 103 new county council houses were built in an area with 4,010 applicants. I was unable to attend yesterday's county council meeting because of commitments to the mini-CTC inquiry, but my colleague, councillor Joanna Tuffy, contacted me to tell me that she established that in the 11 months of this year South Dublin County Council, the second largest local authority, has completed 51 new houses. That is scandalous by any yardstick.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to understand how, in such propitious times, the Government allowed this crisis to worsen to such an extent. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, stated last night, all the affordability indicators have doubled under this Government &ndash; the price of houses, the level of rents, the number on council waiting lists and the number of homeless. The Government has presided over a situation where home ownership, which it professes to cherish, is beyond the reach of a young couple on modest incomes. Not only can they not afford a house of their own, but, ironically, they can no longer afford to rent a house. In my constituency, a modest three bedroom house in dilapidated condition is rented at £800 per month. A woman with three children, who returned three years ago from Birmingham, was in my clinic on Saturday. She pays £800 per month for a poor quality house and has received notice from the landlord that he wants to raise the rent by £100, which she cannot afford and so is facing eviction. This is not an unusual story. This town's hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation are full of single mothers living in appalling conditions who must spend the day on the streets. This is the great scandal of the Government's time in office.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the housing crisis is deepening rather than receding after almost five years of this Government. A new initiative is needed of the same magnitude as the crisis. People mentioned the doubling of figures. In Bray, there are 885 families and individuals, about 7% of the town's population, on the housing list, which is unprecedented and unbelievable. When I asked, as others have, how many houses were completed this year, I was told eight. While more houses will be completed next year, it is more worrying that there is no landbank available to the local authority which means that we will face a famine in housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in the county, as it is nationally, is that the county council acquired land where it is less expensive but where the housing need is least, which means that where the need is greatest there is little or no land. I am <Col N="125" />concerned that the provisions in the new planning and development Act are in danger of being used as a substitute for a housing programme by local authorities. To be fair to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, when he introduced the 20% measure he made it clear that it was not to be a substitute for the social housing programme which local authorities have a statutory responsibility to provide. However, it is clear that there is an over-dependence on potential private development to meet the housing need of the thousands on housing lists, which is unacceptable. It must be reiterated that the people who pay the price for the housing crisis are children. Thousands of children are suffering poverty because of it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this motion because the priority afforded by the Government to housing is clear. Last evening my colleague, the Minster of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, outlined what is, by any standards, a remarkable record of achievement by the Government in housing and the effectiveness of our approach. It must have made dismal listening for the Fine Gael Party and exposed the shallowness of its housing policies and its motivation for bringing forward the motion now. The Government has a clear, comprehensive housing strategy, whose emphasis, as outlined by the Minister, Deputy Molloy, is on maintaining a high level of housing output, expanding the range and supply of social and affordable housing, developing the private rented sector and improving the quality of the management of the public housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge, which we are meeting successfully, is to achieve these goals and ensure that housing is well planned and sustainable, especially at a time when we may seek to redistribute housing and other development in accordance with the proposed national spatial strategy. It is worth repeating that the total provision for housing in 2001 is over £1.1 billion, up more than one third on 2000 and treble the amount provided in 1997 when the Government came into office. The Government has breathed new life into the local authority house building programme and the capital provision for this year is just over £448 million. This will enable the housing authorities to meet commitments arising in 2001 on works in progress and commence or acquire an additional 7,000 houses this year. We will complete in excess of 5,000 units this year. The combination of social housing measures, including the shared ownership scheme, affordable housing schemes, voluntary housing and the traditional construction pro<Col N="126" />gramme will meet the needs of an estimated 11,000 households in 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the four year multi-annual programme, Cork Corporation plans an expanded programme to provide 1,000 houses between 2000 and 2003. The corporation's provision for its construction programme this year reflects this increased activity. A sum of £21 million in funding is being provided, which is an increase of over 50% over the original allocation of £13.8 million last year. This indicates the Government's commitment to addressing social housing needs in Cork city.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the unique contribution that the voluntary housing sector can make to middle and low income households and special needs groups. We are expanding the sector to 4,000 units of accommodation per annum by 2006, with substantial funding and a new voluntary housing unit in the Department to drive the sector. Cork Corporation is a strong supporter of the voluntary sector and at the end of June this year, 75 dwellings were under construction. The national development plan provides for area-based regeneration initiatives to restore the physical fabric of established areas and to support communities, notably the redevelopment of Ballymun. Earlier this year we approved proposals for the redevelopment of the Glen area in Cork city. This will involve the upgrading of the housing stock on a number of fronts to include new housing, comprehensive regeneration of existing housing and an expanded management and maintenance programme at an estimated total cost of £40 million. I understand that work is due to start early next year on the first phase of the redevelopment that will involve construction of 48 new dwellings and the refurbishment of 66 existing dwellings. The work will also include demolishing one block of flats and refurbishing the remaining 12 blocks. This is a major undertaking for Cork Corporation and I am happy to give the redevelopment my full support. It will contribute enormously to the regeneration of the Glen area.</P>
    <P>Plans are also being advanced for the comprehensive redevelopment of Knocknaheeney area. The opportunities presented by the regeneration and refurbishment programmes are being utilised by authorities to put in place more localised housing management arrangements and to promote better communication with tenants through improved consultation and participation. Resources are also being provided under the remedial works scheme that targets the upgrading and improvement of low cost, pre-1960 dwellings and run down local authority housing estates. Nationally, more than £50 million has been provided under this scheme since its inception. A number of major projects are currently under way in Cork city involving the refurbishment of 732 dwellings at an estimated cost of £20 million.</P>
    <P>A key concern for the Government has been to meet the special needs of particular categories of households such as the elderly and the disabled. This concern is reflected in the substantially increased funding for the task force on <Col N="127" />housing aid for the elderly, the disabled persons grant scheme, the essential repairs grants scheme and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing. The total number of grants paid under the disabled grants scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme in 2000 was just over 5,000 with a value of approximately £25 million. The number of houses improved under the task force and improvement works in lieu scheme was just under 4,000. Activity under these schemes in the first half of this year points to an even higher level of activity in 2001.</P>
    <P>Last evening, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, outlined the major advances the Government has made in tackling the issue of homelessness. Record levels of funding and the necessary organisational arrangements to ensure that homelessness is tackled in an integrated manner match our commitment in this respect. Earlier this year, I launched the Cork action plan which presents a clear framework for tackling homelessness in Cork over the next three years. The purpose of the plan is to address current gaps in services for the homeless, to create an effective service delivery system for the homeless and to ensure that housing, education and health policies are focused on the prevention of homelessness in Cork. The preparation of the Cork action plan was very much a collaborative effort involving a range of statutory and voluntary bodies and, most importantly, the homeless people themselves. I would take this opportunity to once again commend everyone involved.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to Deputy Molloy for the work he has done and the success he has achieved in the area of housing. The Fine Gael motion, like its other failed policies, should be consigned to the scrap head. I wholeheartedly support the Government's amended motion.</P>

Last year there was an output of 50,000 units nationally &ndash; the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. Does Fine Gael want us to reverse policies that are now yielding significant moderation in house prices? Data show that house price rises are now lower than at any time since 1996.</P>

I remind Deputy Farrelly that this is a measure that his party supported when the Bill was before these Houses.</P>
      <P>The last bright idea Fine Gael had in housing policy was the £5,000 new house grant. What did the £5,000 new house grant do? If denuded Darndale, Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fine Gael is looking for it both ways but it cannot have it both ways. When I joined the city council in 1985, Fine Gael was in Government. It had dominated the city council prior to that and had done very little by way of a capital programme. When Fianna Fáil took over the city council in 1985 we had hundreds of properties that had become derelict. Fine Gael did two things, it created ghettos that have taken years to reverse and drove up prices in the private sector. People who could not afford a new house were shoved out by the attraction of £5,000 in order to live in so-called middle class areas. Many of them ran into trouble and had to come back into the social housing market. If that is what Fine Gael is proposing, I look forward to having a nice joust with them during the next election campaign.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell has been around for the last 25 years and remembers it. Everybody said we needed a north ring sewer but nobody did it. This Government provided the serviced land initiative, and to be fair to Fine Gael, their members on Dublin City Council supported Fianna Fáil on the Pelletstown initiative. As a <Col N="129" />result of the careful planning of Ballymun, we have 500 houses under construction in the first phase. The first group of tenants have now moved into their houses. There will be a mix of tenure of houses. There will be people in rented accommodation; they will be able to buy under the shared ownership scheme. People will be able to avail of the affordable housing scheme, the rental subsidy scheme and will be able to buy their rented property on very competitive terms. These schemes are part of Government policy and cannot be denied. The Government is promoting housing co-operatives, an extremely important initiative. Voluntary housing associations, for example, the Respond! Housing Association, have been given £7.8 million to build an attractive, integrated housing development in Finglas. This initiative is being replicated throughout the country. Fine Gael is afraid to admit that these projects are coming on stream and the policy is coming right.</P>

      <P>When one is in Opposition, the barrel is always half empty. There is not much fairness in some of the contributions. I would be the first to admit that all is not well in the housing industry. The Government was faced with the serious problem of rapidly increasing house prices. The big concern expressed was about first time buyers and the difficulties they were having in getting into the property market. Last year in particular there were a number of measures taken by the Minister to try to deal with this. Any fair minded person would say that they have brought about major changes. Now could be seen as an excellent time for first time buyers to make their purchase. Interest rates are at historically low levels and house price inflation has stabilised while in some areas prices have reduced. There can be no denying the measures taken by the Government last year have yielded positive results. The number of houses completed in the first nine months of this year has increased by 4% compared to the corresponding period last year. First time buyers comprised 38% of the market in the first six months of 2000 and this has increased to 44% in the corresponding period this year. More first time buyers have been attracted into the market by the Government. Such an increase had been sought by the House and the Government has delivered on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" />I refer to a recent statement by An Taisce. It said it will object to planning permission granted for any single dwelling in rural Ireland and it has already objected to a number of applications which were approved by Kildare County Council. There has been a significant increase in the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála. Last year there were more than 5,300 appeals, which was a 13% increase on 1999. We are all aware of the backlog and difficulties experienced by the officials working for An Bord Pleanála as they try to reach decisions on time. The decision of An Taisce displays its total ignorance of what life in rural Ireland is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should withdraw the grant to An Taisce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. Guidelines have been issued by Kildare County Council for people who are eligible under the county development plan to build in a rural part of the county. Those guidelines are stringent and it is very difficult for people to qualify. It is a costly exercise to buy a site and build a house without a group such as An Taisce objecting without regard for the function of the planning authority or of elected members. An Bord Pleanála should treat the objections by An Taisce as vexatious and throw them out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an insult to people that this should be so and it is not right that the Government should provide funding to An Taisce. I appreciate the good job that has been done by its members in the past but what An Taisce is doing now is nothing short of a disgrace and it should change its policy immediately.</P>
      <P>Most of the development in County Kildare has taken place in Kildare North and in our development plans we have tried to encourage people to move to the middle and south of the county. That has paid dividends in recent years and the Government's decision to reopen the train station at Monasterevan will make that part of the county much more attractive to people.</P>
      <P>We must not look to the Government to implement every initiative. Local authorities have flexibility and they should introduce initiatives and not look to others to do the job for them. The 20% social and affordable housing provision under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, has been met by Kildare County Council and it is taking up land wherever possible. While there are difficulties in housing, the measures that have been introduced will pay rich dividends in the long term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not losing my mind and if I am allowed to continue without interruption, I will be able to prove that. A combination of Government initiatives to front load the housing programme through local authorities over the past two years has dealt effectively with housing waiting lists in my constituency, similar to most other rural constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the waiting lists only doubled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Waiting lists have been reduced. If the Deputy spent less time criticising the Government and more time encouraging her local authority to front load housing and allocate social housing, she might recognise that decrease. However, if she spends her time coming into the House raising an issue for the sake of it, she will not do much to reduce waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, visited my constituency and commended the initiatives taken by the local authority. I congratulate him and the Government for taking a wide range of measures that have helped to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output, address practical difficulties such as the lack of infrastructural support through water and sewerage grants, etc., create easier access to the market for first time buyers and improve affordability for first time buyers and low income households.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. Government initiatives are working. Last year 13 houses per 1,000 head of population were built, which was the highest rate in the EU. We must be doing something right if Ireland can brag and boast definitively that it has the highest rate of house building in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It had the highest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing output in Ireland is four times that of the UK. Last year house completions reached 50,000 nationally and it was the sixth consecutive year there was record housing output. I do not know what the Opposition Members find so funny because those are the facts and people recognise that.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy has been to ensure that first time house purchasers are prioritised. They account for a large share of the market as the number of applicants for new house grants has increased by 6.3% for the first four months of this year following an increase of 4.8% during the corresponding period in 2000. Opposition Members are not amused but I am quite happy to report that statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant measure taken by the Govern<Col N="132" />ment is the provision of £6 billion in the national development plan for social and affordable housing. The Government has committed a further £1 billion to the initiative and the total provision for social housing in 2001 will be more than £1.1 billion, an increase of one-third on last year.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of the housing industry is that more should be done to encourage local authorities to permit house building in rural areas. The increase in water grants some years ago led to a significant increase in house construction in rural Ireland. I would like the Minister to increase sewerage grants to a similar level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is mighty. I support Deputy Power's comments but do not wish to waste time criticising An Taisce. Water and sewerage grants should be increased so that rural communities can become established and develop. If grants were approved for communal schemes, large numbers of people would be removed from the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will encourage local authorities to become more proactive in the voluntary housing sector.</P>
      <P>Only last week in my constituency 76 units were opened by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. That can be combined with the other initiatives throughout the county in the last four years. The waiting list in my constituency could be halved and that might come as a shock to Deputy Mitchell who seemed to think that I was plucking these figures out of the air. We could reduce that waiting list by half by further encouraging the voluntary sector. The feeling out there unfortunately is that voluntary housing is not successful in rural areas. We have disproved that in four towns in County Laois. As a new Deputy I am very pleased to say that the Government has responded to this urgent need and the next five years in office will clear out any difficulties in the housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I congratulate and commend the Ministers, Deputies Dempsey, Molloy and Wallace, on their stewardship of the Department of the Environment and Local Government since June 1997. I am very confident that they will continue to give that Department good leadership until next June and indeed beyond. This Government has introduced many innovative measures and I congratulate the Ministers concerned. The Government's housing policy is sound, well funded, credible and it is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing output has increased dramatically since 1997. For the first time, local authorities can operate a multi-annual housing strategy and voluntary housing is being provided at the highest level and with the best level of assistance. I compliment and commend the various voluntary groups throughout this country who are doing excellent work and availing of the very substan<Col N="133" />tial and generous grant assistance that is available towards the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>In my own county, voluntary groups in many areas are providing housing in some of the more remote areas where the local authority in the past did not see fit to provide it. One of the most innovative measures for rural Ireland is the small towns and villages water and sewerage schemes. The Minister has approved funding for the provision of sewerage and water facilities in a number of villages in my own county. Those villages now have the level of services that can support housing and a credible land bank can be built up and housing provided at a very affordable price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power voiced his serious concern about the announcement by An Taisce that they would object to all one-off house building planning applications in County Kildare. It is scandalous that any credible organisation would launch such a policy or make such an announcement. That type of objection should be regarded by An Bord Pleanála as vexatious. Nobody can implement a blanket policy of objection to everything.</P>
    <P>I have a serious concern with An Bord Pleanála because it takes far too long for decisions to be made. The Minister has provided increased resources and personnel for An Bord Pleanála. Surely it is not beyond the capability of the board to fast track and prioritise major projects which come before it for decision. I know of an instance in my own county where it took far too long for a decision to be made in relation to a major project. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Another helpful and important initiative particularly in the rural counties is the serviced land initiative. Land is being serviced with water and sewerage and that extra land bank is being made available for affordably priced houses for the people of those areas. Thankfully housing being provided by the local authorities is of a first class standard. The best houses being built in many parts of the country are not being provided by the private sector but by the local authorities. They are sound, good, modern houses, as they should be.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the multi-annual approach was a very important decision. That has allowed housing officers and other officials in the local authorities to make greater use of forward planning. It makes for greater economies of scale. This year 5,000 housing units will be completed and this year will also mark the start of 7,000 other housing units.</P>
    <P>There are now for the first time local authority houses and housing schemes being provided in the smaller towns and villages and indeed in some parishes that do not even have a village status &ndash; parishes that may just consist of a church and a school. Housing is being provided for the older people in society and this enables them to remain in their own parish or village and not have to move to a town perhaps eight or ten miles away. That is very progressive planning on the part of the Department and the Ministers who intro<Col N="134" />duced that are to be commended. Those policies will pay dividends for the future and are paying dividends today.</P>
    <P>Very substantial improvements have been made in the disabled persons grant scheme and the essential repairs grants schemes. All of us who are familiar with rural areas see far too often houses that are derelict or in poor condition. I am pleased that the Minister substantially improved the essential repairs grant scheme and the disabled persons grant scheme. I hope that the Minister will introduce a house improvement grant scheme in order to extend those schemes. I support the work of the Ministers and the Department.</P>

      <P>Very little time is being made available to speak in this debate. This is a serious issue and I am glad to see some of the Government Deputies acknowledging that there is a serious situation in respect of housing. We have never been able to establish the number of people on the current housing lists in the State. The Minister has been asked many times to give us some indication of the numbers but he has refused to do so. It is believed that the number is between 60,000 and 80,000 people. However, he cannot hide the figures about our own constituencies. I have the figures from Wexford County Council, Wexford Corporation, New Ross UDC and Enniscorthy UDC. That is the constituency of Wexford. In 1996 there were 1,200 people on the housing list; there are 1,800 people on the current list in the same area, an increase of 50% and, whether we like it or not, the situation is the same right across the country. Those are the facts. As I said, the Minister has avoided answering questions on this subject several times.</P>
      <P>Indications from the Irish Home Builders' Association are that the supply of houses is falling and the housing crisis is set to intensify. The Government's <i>ad hoc</i> stop-start approach has completely destabilised the market at a time when the demands on the industry are for vastly increased output. The same uncertainty which pervades among builders is also causing banks to be much more cautious when it comes to finance for house building. The result is that the builders are moving to the more certain market of commercial and industrial development. This is bad news for prospective house buyers. Rising prices will push more and more young people into the categories of those who can never hope to own a house. At the same time, the supply of rental accommodation has been completely decimated by the removal of tax deductibility on interest from rental income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" />Any Government should ensure balanced regional development by identifying national growth centres and an adequate supply of houses which will be serviced to accommodate a 20 year target population. Besides basic services, all other facilities required to attract and retain the young population of the growth centres, such as schools, health centres, shopping, public transport, child care, recreational and cultural facilities, should be channelled to those areas. Job creation should be actively encouraged and facilitated through the IDA and the use of strategic development zones. All future land zoning by local authorities should be informed by the targets set in the national spatial strategy. They will then be required to prepare plans to service zoned land, if necessary in conjunction with adjoining local authorities in the region, to ensure that their lands can be brought to market when required.</P>
    <P>To build sustainable communities, all future housing should be planned in a way that facilitates efficient public transport use and provided in clusters close to existing or planned public transport routes. To encourage increased supply of rented accommodation, providers should be allowed to write off mortgage interest against the rental income of the property. To prevent speculative buying, such reliefs should apply only if the property is retained as rental accommodation for at least five years. The recommendations of the commission on the private rented sector should be closely examined to give greater security and certainty to tenants and landlords.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be resourced with planners and the other professional and support staff necessary to ensure the highest quality built environment and to speed up the planning process. Initially, this will require some short-term contracts and possible housing subsidies to attract planners, particularly from abroad. Local authorities should be directed to make greater use of voluntary housing associations to deliver social housing. They have the flexibility and the expertise to manage larger building projects and they have a proven track record of successful estate management and social integration.</P>
    <P>The funding for home improvements for the elderly should be quadrupled to protect the housing stock and also to ensure that older people can remain as long as possible in their own homes. This is a most important point. We have heard the Government bragging about what it has done for older people, but it has done very little for them. Health board programmes are way behind. In my constituency of Wexford, 40 houses are awaiting work but only one a month is being completed. These important areas have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Government has made many promises but the point about the price of houses in every constituency has been well made in the debate. The price of houses is forcing young people on to the housing list. The cheapest three bedroom house in my town of Gorey is £120,000. The repayment <Col N="136" />on that type of borrowing, even with the current low interest rates, is in the region of £650 a month. Young people with a take home wage of £300 or £350 cannot afford that type of mortgage. The level of subsidies is completely inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member of the House is aware of the failure of the Government to ensure that an adequate supply of new homes is available to satisfy the needs of young people. The Government's housing policy has failed in every aspect; it has achieved the opposite of its stated objectives. It has pushed up rents and allowed the cost of houses to move beyond the reach of young working couples. The supply of new houses is far from adequate and the number of new starts is well short of a figure which would ensure that supply outstripped demand.</P>
      <P>The Government has not addressed the issues which challenge the ability of the construction industry, which is under stress, to deliver to young families the houses of their dreams. Something is seriously wrong when nurses, gardaí, mid-ranking civil servants and local government officers cannot afford a door of their own. There has been a baby boom over the past 15 years. Due to the Government's health policy, most of those babies were born in corridors and due to its housing policy, they will be living in corridors for the next 15 years.</P>
      <P>The problem of resources in local authorities and An Bord Pleanála contributes to the delays in the system. The Minister must address the remuneration packages in these bodies and ensure they are adequately staffed with the best professionals. The delays caused by appeals to An Bord Pleanála must be halved. This could happen if resources were put in place. If council planning departments were manned adequately, many planning decisions might not be appealed. The issue of withering planning permissions after two years must be revisited. The uncertainty involved is not beneficial to the long-term development of good community housing and the problem must be tackled now.</P>
      <P>The social and affordable housing requirement has not had a significant effect in terms of putting on the market homes in the required locations for those who most need them. If anything, a lack of commercial confidence exists due to the requirements not only among property developers, but among their selling agents, the investment sector and the purchasers, who are making lifetime investments. These people are unsure of what they are buying into and the measures are causing great uncertainty in the construction sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy in the context of the implementation of the Bacon report has forced up the cost of rental property. The Government is responsible for this price hike and its strategy means people face rents of up to 30% higher than should be the case. It denies young couples the right to own a home of their own. Instead of delivering homes for our people, the miserable measures have caused hardship among the <Col N="137" />nation's Celtic tiger generation. A loss of £1 billion worth of investment property has occurred as the sector moved into other markets. The Government should reintroduce rental property interest reliefs and encourage investors back into the marketplace. It should force rents down and support the construction industry. The Government should help it to maintain the employment level and assist it in producing the housing output that is required to meet the needs of people who are looking for homes. The planning issues being pushed by the Minister and his Department will create social problems in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. The housing issue touches many people and there is widespread concern about it. One of the Government's legacies is the failure of its entire housing policy. When it came into office, it promised to solve all the problems in the housing area and everybody believed that would happen. However, it has totally failed in every area.</P>
      <P>I could mention many aspects but I will refer to some of the smaller schemes that could have been hugely successful. The housing aid for the elderly scheme has the potential to be one of the best schemes, but money is not available for it. If one asks any of the health boards or county councils that are administering it, one will discover that there are insufficient funds for the scheme. In my constituency of South Tipperary, the money for the scheme was exhausted by April. The amount of money available could only meet 30% of the requirement. This scheme could be extremely effective but it is a total failure. It could give a better quality of life to many elderly people who contributed to the State and gave much to their communities. They only need grants of £1,500 or £2,000 to repair their doors and windows, small things that would improve their quality of life, but the Government has not provided sufficient finance to make the scheme work. I agree it could be a great scheme but it needs adequate resources. If money is not provided for it, the scheme will be no good.</P>
      <P>The works in lieu of re-housing scheme involves huge delays and bureaucracy. If somebody applied for assistance under the scheme, he or she would be lucky to have the work done within seven or eight years. The amount of work in lieu carried out in most council areas is very small compared to the need that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is another failure. Huge numbers of people in every council area are waiting for their applications to be considered, but there are not enough people available to administer it in health boards. This is another example of a scheme with the potential to enhance people's quality of life. However, the funding necessary to administer the scheme has not been provided with the result that there are huge backlogs, particularly in my constituency. The Fianna Fáil members on my local authority spoke about this matter only last Monday and <Col N="138" />intend to contact the Department to discuss it further.</P>
    <P>It is now more difficult than ever for young people to acquire their own houses, whether they are building or buying them. They face difficulties at every stage of the process from obtaining planning permission to meeting qualifying income thresholds. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. Coming from a rural constituency, I am aware that councils are discriminating against those who want to build houses in rural Ireland. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government must take a strong lead in addressing this issue. Local planners are citing all manner of technicalities to prevent houses being built in rural areas, houses whose occupants would sustain populations in areas where farming is becoming an increasingly difficult way of life. This issue must be examined if the population levels necessary to sustain rural football clubs, churches and schools are to be maintained.</P>
      <P>One of the Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development recently launched a programme which is completely at variance with the attitude displayed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. While one is trying to attract more people into rural areas, the other is trying to get them out. To add insult to injury, An Taisce seems to be jumping on the bandwagon.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers addressed the difficulties faced by the elderly in local authority and health board areas and these must be dealt with. Two people working in reasonably paid jobs today cannot get a mortgage and this is exerting huge pressure on local authority housing lists. There has been a colossal increase in house prices over the past four and a half years. Single people also face difficulties. A young single woman from a small village in my constituency has spent eight years on a housing list and has no hope of getting a house in the near future. She is not well and cannot even afford a self-contained flat. What hope can the Minister offer this woman? Broken marriages also cause difficulties, particularly for men. Many men who vacate their family homes do not qualify under the current regulations for local authority housing. The criteria must be changed and suitable accommodation must be provided for these people.</P>
      <P>The cost of housing in Dublin has a serious ripple effect on my constituency 80 miles away with students leaving Monaghan and Cavan to attend college in the city. The closure of St. Patrick's College in Monaghan represented an obvious opportunity for the State to develop a third level college in the town but the Government walked away from it. The property will certainly not be used for students. The policies pursued by the Government have resulted in dramatic increases in the cost of rented accommodation in Dublin, causing problems for students and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" />I welcome the commitment given by Deputy Brendan Smith, my constituency colleague, to push for a housing repairs grant. The tremendous scheme introduced by the previous Fine Gael led Government was scrapped by the current Government. The terms of the scheme could, if reintroduced, be improved and I urge the Government to consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Deputies for sharing time. There is no doubt whatsoever that the Government's housing policies have failed miserably. Some 50,000 applicants, representing in the region of 130,000 people in need of accommodation, languish on local authority housing lists. There are at least 5,500 homeless people on our streets. Since 1996, the number of people on local authority waiting lists has risen by 43%. At the root of this crisis is the Government's near total reliance on the private sector and its failure to fully equip local authorities to house our citizens.</P>
      <P>Incredibly, given the massive need we see all around us, only 8% of all houses are being built by local authorities or the voluntary sector. This is by far the lowest share for any period in the past century. The soaring house prices of recent years drove increasing numbers of people on to local authority waiting lists and into private rented accommodation. While house prices have moderated somewhat in 2001, this has clearly done nothing to alleviate the crisis. In the property supplements of today's newspapers, we read that the site of the former Clancy Barracks in this city is still for sale after the Department of Defence refused to countenance the proposal from Sinn Féin and others that it be made available to Dublin Corporation as an ideal location for local authority housing. Instead, the Minister for Defence is holding out for his £20 million asking price, the proceeds to doubtless be used to buy military equipment to meet the requirements of the Rapid Reaction Force and NATO's Partnership for Peace. The Government would rather provide tanks than houses.</P>
      <P>New house starts are down by 20% in 2001 and the slowdown in the private housing sector provides an opportunity for the Government to use the available capacity of the construction industry to attack the housing crisis by increasing resources for public sector housing. Earlier today I launched Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission and our key housing recommendation is for a major renewed State investment in a comprehensive social housing programme with front loading of funding under the national development plan to allow local authorities to house our citizens. We call for the elimination of waiting lists by local authorities with an immediate target of 70% of applicant units to be provided with suitable accommodation within two years of being on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need control of land prices with a statutory ceiling on the price of land zoned for housing to <Col N="140" />stop speculation and reduce house prices. There should be statutory control of rents in the private rented sector, strengthened laws to set standards for accommodation and additional resources to implement those regulations. We also seek a renovation grant of up to £5,000 to assist home owners to improve their properties and a special grant to encourage utilisation of urban and rural derelict sites for new domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>I commend these proposals to the Government and record my opposition to its amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion's underlying motivation is the restoration of confidence in the housing market. Those who heard last night's address by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing will know his comments were totally at variance with the reality on the ground. The Minister of State referred to house prices. Anyone who examines house prices from 1997 to the present will see they have escalated out of control. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his Ministers of State have dismally failed to restore confidence in the housing market, confidence required to allow young people to access housing as they have in the past.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have failed to do anything constructive to make housing more accessible to young people. The Government's spatial strategy will deny young people in rural Ireland the right to build even a single dwelling on a family farm. Is that constructive? Is that encouraging young people to get a house of their own? The answer to my questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This Government has a spatial policy strategy for Dublin, Cork and Limerick. The rest of the country has to comply with the edict regardless of the serious consequences. This Government has ensured that housing lists have increased dramatically. I heard a complaint from a constituent today that a developer in Loughrea has offered 20 houses to Galway County Council under the affordable housing scheme in order to offload property as a result of the decline in the private housing market.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, Deputy Dempsey can sit there and say he is satisfied with the Government's housing initiatives, it is time he looked at himself realistically. The people will say they have had enough of the Government, as it has failed in relation to housing on every count. This Government has failed to take the initiative to tackle An Bord Pleanála, which is out of control. The people outside Dublin and the major cities will suffer until the authority is replaced by regional appeals boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up where Deputy Ulick Burke finished, by condemning the Dublin 4 thinking of An Taisce. The most outrageous statement since the foundation of the State was made by an official of An Taisce who said there will not be any more development in rural Ireland. I condemn such remarks and those who <Col N="141" />make them will be fought every step of the way. We had to fight for our freedom in the past and if we have to do so again in the west, we are happy to do so. We do not accept dictatorship from An Taisce. The Minister should take on another statutory agency, the fisheries board. When county councils grant planning permission, people wonder if it will be An Taisce or the fisheries board that objects. Bord Gáis is now objecting to planning permission in the west, which leads me to wonder if we have gone mad in this country.</P>
      <P>We have a great deal of legislation in relation to Travellers and asylum seekers, but the needs of women need to be similarly addressed, as they have been let down by every Government.</P>

      <P>Landlords do not accept women looking for rented accommodation if they have children, regardless of whether one, two or three children are involved. The abortion debate in this House has shown that everybody wants to help women, but nobody is doing anything for homeless women. A woman with five children contacted me to say that she will have no home from next Friday evening, as her husband has been allowed to stay in their three-bedroom local authority house following their separation. The fact that she is on social welfare and has a health board book means she has to look for rental accommodation. It is time legislation was brought in to deal with the plight of women. The women of this House and of this country have had to put up with too much for too long and it is time they annoyed men. They should stand by one another, rather than allowing men to legislate for them. Women have to look for accommodation, look after children and make requests to the council or to politicians, but they encounter nothing but disrespect.</P>

I will send a letter I received recently from the local authority to the Minister so he can read what it had to say. It did not demonstrate much respect for women. In the next six months, every political party and all the do-gooders, including priests and bishops will say that we should do more for women, but nobody is fighting for them when they are seeking accommodation or looking after their children. It is time our women were protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for sharing its time with me and allowing me to record my support for its motion. The Government amendment asks the House to acknowledge the achievements of the Government in housing. <Col N="142" />In 2001, I wonder if it is an achievement that 50,000 families are on local authority housing lists, which makes a total of about 100,000 individuals. Is it an achievement of which the Government is proud? I suggest it should not be. Is it an achievement that 1,200 applicants, or between 3,500 and 4,000 individuals, are on the local authority housing list in south Tipperary? The numbers on the list in my constituency have increased by 40% since the Government took office. Is it an achievement that the Department of the Environment and Local Government will only allow South Tipperary County Council to build 150 houses each year? It will take eight years to clear the existing waiting list at such a pace.</P>
      <P>Is it an achievement that 500 people are homeless and live on the streets of this country? The figures have increased by more than 100%. It is time the Department of the Environment and Local Government ensured that local authorities are allowed to build houses. It is despicable and disgraceful that only 8% of all houses are built by local authorities. The Minister should allow local authorities to build enough houses to ensure that at least 50% of people on their lists are dealt with within a year and a half or two years. This can be achieved if the Minister shows the political will.</P>
      <P>Millions of pounds are being spent on rent subsidies which go directly into the pockets of developers. One wonders if the Department's policy on the building of local authority houses is unavoidable because of the fact that millions of pounds are being spent on subsidies by health boards and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>All of us should have a problem with that including the Opposition who seem to hunger and yearn for problems everywhere. Problems can only be solved by actions not avoidance. The Rainbow Coalition avoided issues when they had a problem. They avoided the housing issue as they faced the electorate in trepidation in 1997. In 1996 they authorised 3,700 local authority housing starts.</P>

      <P>This Government takes action &ndash; for example, the action taken to balance supply and demand for housing and action which has given us stability in house prices. In taking that action we knew that we must also lay the foundations for a fairer housing system &ndash; a system that would never again see people on reasonable wages priced out of the market. In Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, I took ruthless and radical measures to secure a just housing market which will meet the housing needs of people on low and middle incomes.</P>
      <P>I was supported by the Labour Party on that but not by the party opposite which tabled this motion and tried everything it could to prevent Part 5 from becoming part of legislation. At that time I stepped into the market and told builders that out of every five homes they build one would have to be an affordable home.</P>

      <P>A builder who takes a risk and buys a chunk of land and sees it going up enormously in value because it is rezoned from agricultural use to development use is entitled to make a profit but he should also contribute to the common good. This contribution should not be punitive but he should use 20% of that land for affordable or social housing. That move alone is already making a difference to first time house buyers and to those who need social housing.</P>

      <P>This Government has taken action on housing, knowing one simple fact that the Opposition, in their mad rush to curry favour with speculators and other vested interests, seems to have missed. The fact is that demand may have slowed down in November but it cannot slow in the long term. It cannot slow down because of demographics. There are more people coming into the country, more people staying in the country and more young people coming to the age when they want to settle and have their own home. The need is there and will continue. The demand may take a dip but that is because at this moment nobody is advising people who want their first home to buy. Nobody is telling them to go for it. This is the best time to buy a house and they should not wait. The commission for auctioneers might not be as big but people will at least get a reasonably priced house.</P>

Anyone who wants a State handout, speculators and those looking for unreasonable profit will want to distract from the fact that in a market affected by unprecedented pressures, some very recent and very tragic, this Government has still managed to deliver on its concerns for first time home buyers. The Fine Gael motion and speeches show that party speaks for those with a vested interest.</P>

      <P>I will share time with Deputies Brian Hayes and Olivia Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a serious housing problem in this <Col N="146" />country, but having listened to the Minister I regret to say that the person in charge does not recognise it. Fianna Fáil has been in Government for 12 of the last 14 years but can only harp on the two year period when the Rainbow Coalition was in place. What a pathetic argument. The Minister should consider what is happening in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area. Colleagues should read the stupid amendment to this motion. The Government actually congratulates itself on all it has done for housing, including moderating the rate of house price increases. Is the Minister aware that a local authority house in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area is selling for over £200,000? Does he realise that not one young person or first time buyer in the area can afford a house in the area in which they were born? They have to go to Wicklow. One of my own children had to pay £195,000 for a three bedroomed semi-detached between Bray and Greystones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why Part 5 will be helpful to the Deputy's constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy imagine the trauma facing young people on low incomes with mortgages of £170,000 or can he imagine the fear and trepidation they must face with the downturn in the economy? In the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area there are over 3,000 people on the waiting list and there were only seven houses built for the area. The Minister has a cheek telling us that the Government has done marvels for first time house buyers and for those on the housing list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It just shows how out of date the Minister is in dealing with the job. What else has been done? Let us look at supply and demand. It is a basic principle that if demand increases and supply decreases things get more expensive. The Government has driven investors out of private rented accommodation and sent £1 billion of investors' money to Portugal and Spain. The Minister has not come up with one suggestion as to how private rented accommodation is to be got. The rent for a three bedroom semi-detached house in Wicklow is £1,000 a month. Is the Minister telling us that people who cannot afford to buy a house should pay £250 a week out of taxed income to rent a semi-detached three bedroom house and at the same time try to save to buy a house? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has had four years of a Celtic tiger economy to solve this problem yet people do not have the basic requirement of a decent home. Will the Minister come to my clinics and tell people with three or four children who are living in one room or with their parents that he has done marvellous work for them? Most of these people do not have a chance of getting a <Col N="147" />house in the next five years because of the inability of the Minister and his two Ministers of State to do the job the taxpayers pay them to do and to do it properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are record levels of house building. Last year 50,000 houses were built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to look across at the three amigos. Their appalling record has been rightly pointed out in Deputy Olivia Mitchell's motion.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, people have been forced out of the private rented sector and into homelessness. When the Finance (No. 2) Bill, which my party opposed, was introduced in 1998 and did away with mortgage interest relief on rental property, the rent on a semi-detached house in Ballycullen in my constituency was £700 per month. The rent on a similar property now, since the introduction of that interventionist measure in 1998, is £950. That is an increase of 30% in two years. The measure which the Government introduced to bring down the price of rented property in Dublin has increased rents by between 25% and 30%.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, established a housing commission but he still has not introduced the most basic reforms in the private rented sector to ensure better standards of tenancy for our people. The result of his bungling is a 30% increase in the cost of renting in Dublin. The amount of money the State has had to give in rent subsidy is being forced up and it is now mainly women who are on the homeless list. The only advice I can give my constituents who cannot afford to buy or rent a house or who cannot get a local authority house is to go on to the homeless list. The same advice is being given to people in Dublin and the surrounding counties and the homeless list has increased in the past two years since that measure was introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister lays much claim on the Government's increased investment in social housing. There is more money for social housing but the local authorities are not building these houses. A much more radical approach must be taken, particularly in Dublin, to the building of local authority homes. The four Dublin local authorities do not have the individual capacity to build the massive number of social houses required in the city. Intervention is required by the Government to give one authority in Dublin the task of building houses quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed to deal with the housing issue and it will be remembered for it. If the Government put half as much energy into building homes as it spent on its national stadium we would have had many more homes many <Col N="148" />years ago. That is why this motion is before the House. The Government will be hounded on this issue between now and the election by the thousands of people who have been let down by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night and again tonight we were subjected to further examples of ministerial empty rhetoric from a Government which knows it has squandered the opportunities of the past four years, but is choosing to stick its head in the sand and by denying the reality hopes other people will not realise the extent of the crisis. The rest of the population must live in the real world and deal with the realities this crisis means for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us he has firm evidence that his policies are succeeding. If the Government's intention was to sap all confidence from the industry so that buyers, builders and lenders are leaving the industry in droves it has succeeded, but I do not think that was the Government's intention. It is impossible to believe the Government, with all its advisers, could be so out of touch as not to realise that its prime policies are totally counterproductive and have produced results which are the opposite of what was required. The combination of the Government's policies have been disastrous for everyone concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, to claim credit for this is either to miss the point or to be disingenuous. The houses which were built last year were the result of investment decisions made at least four years prior to that. The Minister is responsible for what is happening now. He is responsible for all of the policy decisions made since the first Bacon report. Fine Gael predicted the results at the time and now we see the painful evidence of the outcome of those measures.</P>
      <P>We now have a Government induced crisis much deeper and more serious than the one with which we started. That was merely a supply shortage. We now have a supply shortage, a reduction in demand which is totally artificial and nobody, neither buyer nor seller, willing to fund the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances Fine Gael undertakes to remove the two year limitation on planning permissions &ndash; a bizarre measure. The Minister should not hide behind legal advice. We will rationalise and reduce stamp duty to a maximum of 6%, applicable to houses up to £500,000.</P>
      <P>The Government has reduced mobility of labour, increased the cost of housing unnecessarily and reduced the optimum use of houses.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael will immediately restore interest deductibility to borrowings for the provision of rented accommodation. Deductibility is available to every other business in the economy and it makes no sense to remove it from the one business to which we want to give an incentive. This has had devastating results. The Minister knows it and he cannot be so intransigent as to ignore it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as putting confidence back into the market, what is required is to make houses affordable again and to give some hope to those who in the past could have aspired to buying a <Col N="150" />house. I made suggestions last night. The Minister would have heard them if he had remained to listen. Even if prices were to fall through the floor &ndash; and this is not desirable from any point of view &ndash; this would not offer hope to those who are in need of housing if confidence is so absent from the market that builders are afraid to build and buyers are afraid to buy. This is the climate the Minister has created and will remain for years to come if the Minister persists with his policies. Even if the Minister changes his policies now it will take years for supply to crank up again.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not care about the social misery caused by the lack of housing, he cannot ignore an industry which last year paid into the State's coffers £1.5 billion, which the Government subsequently squandered, and which employs 70,000 people. These jobs are now being shed from building sites throughout the country and huge layoffs are being predicted for Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to admit it got it wrong, reverse its existing policies and try to retrieve the situation so that the downturn in the housing industry does not become a general trend in the entire economy. If this happens it will be at the Minister's door. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil an tAire sinsear anseo. Bhí sí anseo cúpla nóiméad ó shin.</P>
      <P>Only for good luck and the vigilance of an alert signalman at Rathdrum station we could well be dealing with a major rail tragedy in this House this evening. At 8.15 p.m. on Thursday last two locomotives hitched together de-coupled from their carriages at Arklow station. The locomotives travelled unmanned and presumably unlighted for three miles in the direction of Rathdrum. At the same time the Connolly to Rosslare passenger train was about to depart Rathdum station. Had the passenger train left the station there would have been a head-on train collision involving two locomotives with a combined weight of 160 tonnes and a passenger train. One shudders to think what the outcome would have been. The crash would have happened had the runaway locomotives not reached an incline in the line which brought them to a halt and had the alert signalman at Rathdrum not thrown the switch to divert the oncoming locomotives.</P>
      <P>It is not the first time this type of incident has happened. I understand there was a similar occurrence recently at Heuston Station when a driverless locomotive literally took off, as well as another similar incident on the southern line. I ask the Minister, as the person ultimately responsible for rail transport as well as being a shareholder and owner of the company, why she was not notified about last Thursday's incident. Why was the Minister not in a position when notified to bring the matter into the public domain? Why did Iarnród Éireann not come clean before it was forced to do so yesterday? Why is there such a culture of secrecy within the company which the Minister owns? Who is carrying out the investigation into exactly what went wrong?</P>
      <P>I would like to establish this evening why it has not been possible to find out in the intervening six days how this incident occurred. I understand that Rathdrum station was evacuated. For how long was it evacuated? I understand the passenger train was also evacuated and I would like to know for how long it was evacuated. We are also entitled to know how many passengers were on the passenger train at the time. We must also find out what caused the incident and whether it was a design fault. I would like to find out if the indications at this stage are that this incident was caused by human error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know why the Minister &ndash; she was present a couple of moments ago and I do not know why she has departed the House &ndash; has not yet published, let alone enacted, the long overdue and urgently needed rail safety Bill, which she promised on the day she took office. This is a public safety issue and the travelling public is entitled to have confidence in the public <Col N="153" />rail system. How can the travelling public have confidence in a rail system such as this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a ardú sa Teach anocht agus deis a thabhairt dom freagra cuimsitheach a thabhairt dó.</P>
      <P>Without doubt, the incident in Arklow on Thursday, 8 November 2001 gives rise for concern. A high level formal inquiry is under way by Iarnród Éireann to establish the full cause or causes of the incident.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann provided the following statement to the officials of the Minister for Public Enterprise:</P>
      <P>At 20.30 hours approximately on Thursday 8th November 2001, a pair of locomotives, with no train attached and not under power, rolled away from Arklow railway station and entered the Arklow to Rathdrum single line section without authority or crew. The locomotives had been de-coupled from carriages following a journey from Connolly to Arklow and placed and secured on the loopline platform awaiting authority to return to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The 18.30 hours Connolly to Rosslare Europort service was at Rathdrum at the time. Signalling staff immediately activated safety procedures and prevented that train from departing Rathdrum.</P>
      <P>The locomotives, on meeting an incline, came to a halt approximately three miles on the Dublin side of Arklow. Staff went immediately to the location and secured the locomotives. The locomotives were taken out of traffic for technical examination and an inquiry into the incident has commenced.</P>
      <P>The initial notification of the incident was given by telephone from Iarnród Éireann to the chief railway inspecting officer of the Department of Public Enterprise at approximately 10.20 p.m. on the same evening. This indicated that the locomotives came to a halt approximately one quarter of a mile north of the level crossing at Shelton.</P>
      <P>A railway inspecting officer of the Department visited Arklow station the following morning. The preliminary information available from Iarnród Éireann and from the railway inspecting officer would seem to indicate that the incident gave rise to an unsafe situation which, had safety procedures not been activated, could have resulted in a serious accident. It is possible that under slightly different circumstances, for instance had the locomotives moved away a few minutes later, the potential for an accident may have been increased as it may not have been possible to implement safety procedures in sufficient time. The chief railway inspecting officer is seeking further information from Iarnród Éireann, particularly in relation to the technical and procedural issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has asked <Col N="154" />Iarnród Éireann to complete its inquiry as a matter of urgency and to provide a copy of its findings to the chief railway inspecting officer of her Department. She has also requested Iarnród Éireann to provide the chief railway inspecting officer with an interim report as a matter of urgency indicating the preliminary findings of the inquiry and the immediate actions, if any, that are required to prevent similar occurrences on the rail network in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to advise the House that Iarnród Éireann again contacted the chief railway inspecting officer yesterday morning concerning another unrelated incident which took place on the same stretch of track on Monday evening of this week. This incident occurred at approximately 5.30 p.m. on 12 November when a maintenance train arrived at Shelton for stabling. The crew was unable to operate the points to allow the train into the sidings. It noticed smoke issuing from the location case beside the level crossing barriers. It secured the points on the signalman's instruction and proceeded instead to Arklow. A short distance beyond Shelton the locomotive struck a high tension ESB power cable which appeared to have been lying across the tracks. The cable broke, striking and setting fire to a caravan and a car parked at a house adjacent to the railway line. The emergency services and the ESB were called to the scene. Thankfully, no one was injured in the incident.</P>
    <P>It is understood that a number of homes in the Arklow area suffered a power cut as a result. It appears that a number of track circuit relays were burnt out. The line was closed to traffic that evening. Evening passenger train services were terminated at Wicklow and Arklow, with passengers being bussed between these locations. While the Minister for Public Enterprise understands from Iarnród Éireann that the necessary repair work is being carried out at present, the line has been re-opened and is being managed in accordance with Iarnród Éireann special arrangements for operations during degraded conditions. The Minister has been informed that an inquiry is being set up by Iarnród Éireann to establish the full facts of this incident. She will be seeking a report on the findings of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The safety of our railways remains a priority for the Government, particularly the Minister for Public Enterprise. She published the latest report of the independent auditors commissioned to assess Iarnród Éireann's progress in implementing the Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003 and the recommendations of the auditors in previous reports. The conclusions of the auditors were very positive in relation to the progress made by the company. This does not mean that we are complacent about railway safety. From 1999 to the end of 2001, Iarnród Éireann will have invested almost £290 million of Exchequer funds in improving the safety of its railway network and its safety management systems. Substantial funding for the continuation of <Col N="155" />the safety programme will be available for 2002 and 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition to the safety programme, the Minister is updating the outdated legislation which currently regulates the safety of the railways. A railway safety Bill is currently being drafted to be published before Christmas and enacted as a priority in the spring of 2002. The Bill will establish an independent Railway Safety Authority and provide it with wider powers to investigate incidents of this kind, including the power to act as observer at internal Iarnród Éireann inquiries.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McCormack.</P>
      <P>Since last Friday, the office of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at Hynes Buildings, Galway has cut itself off from all telephone contact with the outside world. I understand this has hit County Galway farmers very hard. I also understand the Department's head office in Dublin and its offices in Castlebar and other locations cannot get through to the office in Galway. This curtailment of service is causing havoc for thousands of farmers and gets worse as each day passes. The cause of the problem appears to be that staff in Hynes Buildings are totally frustrated with the snail's pace of progress in finding suitable office accommodation. They have a <i>bona fide </i>case on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I am very familiar with the office concerned, as is the Minister of State at the Department, and it is absolutely true to say that it does not measure up to present day requirements. The space is insufficient to allow the staff to give the level of efficient service which they would like. Moreover, the Office of Public Works, which has a major responsibility in the matter, has not distinguished itself greatly in this instance. It can hardly be surprised at the reaction to its failure to provide a suitable building in Galway over such a long period.</P>
      <P>My information on the current situation is based mainly on my contact with the farming community, rather than any direct contact with the staff, but it appears that the Minister must intervene tomorrow morning and set a deadline date which the staff have been seeking for many years. It is quite possible to do this. It is most unfair to those farmers who have problems with their file records. The staff are continuing to work on those files which are in order, but where there are problems requiring an input from the farmers concerned they cannot be expected to travel into Galway from Clifden, Ballinasloe and other places &ndash; that is what the telephone is for. If files are not properly updated, payments will be delayed, as the Minister of State well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a problem for a long time, like a time bomb which had to go off eventually. I urge the Minister of State and his senior ministerial <Col N="156" />colleague to intervene tomorrow morning with a view to getting heads together, as between the Department and the Office of Public Works, to sort out this matter once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Having failed in my attempt to raise this matter on the Order of Business, under Standing Order 31, I am glad that Deputy Connaughton succeeded in raising it on the Adjournment. It is a serious matter in County Galway, both in the west and east of the county. A go-slow and failure to answer telephones are worse than a strike. If there is a strike, with everybody out, somebody will intervene to solve it quickly. In the present go-slow it appears work is going on behind closed doors, but there is no contact with the outside world, either through public representatives or the general public.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to take steps to solve this acute problem, of which he is well aware. It is particularly serious for Connemara farmers, in particular, including difficulties with regard to acreage and other matters which have to be resolved through telephone contact with the Galway office. It will have to be solved sooner or later. If it is an accommodation problem, as the staff say it is, that problem must be addressed urgently. The Minister of State should meet the staff and tell them what he proposes to do to resolve the problem in order that normal communications can be restored.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an mbeirt Teachta a shocraigh an ceist seo a thógáil. Tuigim cé chomh tromchúiseach is atá sé. I appreciate, as the Deputies have outlined, how serious an issue this is, both for the staff involved and also for the farming community. I regret the disruption to the farming community which is being caused by the dispute.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in correspondence with the Office of Public Works for several years to provide the additional accommodation, either in the existing Hynes Buildings or elsewhere in Galway city. In County Galway there are approximately 150 staff of my Department located in Hynes Buildings, Murrough, Tuam and Loughrea. The staff in Hynes Buildings, in central Galway city, work in the district veterinary office and the district livestock office administering various schemes, including the area based compensatory allowance scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the ewe premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office accommodation in Hynes Buildings has been barely adequate for some time and the Department received sanction from the Department of Finance in April 2001 to acquire an additional 12,000 square feet of office space. Detailed accommodation briefs had been supplied to the Office of Public Works, the office charged with responsibility for acquiring or leasing office space for Government Departments and Offices. At the time it was understood that an existing tenant in Hynes Buildings was vacating the premises and the intention was that this <Col N="157" />space would be acquired by the Office of Public Works. This was an ideal solution, as it would retain the integrity of services being provided at the local office. However, by late summer, it transpired that this space was not being vacated and the Office of Public Works had to seek alternative accommodation on the open market.</P>
    <P>On 1 November the Department was notified by the Civil and Public Service Union, CPSU, the trade union representing clerical staff, that they were commencing limited industrial action from 8 November, in the light of the failure to improve staff accommodation in the Galway office. The industrial action began with a ban on the use of telephones and fax by staff. The CPSU has warned that the action may escalate to include closure of the public office, strict application of clerical office duties, refusal to do work of other grades and refusal to cover the work of staff who have left the office for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the present industrial action will cause inconvenience to some farmers who wish to telephone or fax the local office, I am satisfied that processing of all outstanding applications under the various schemes can be completed within the timeframe set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. The position in so far as payments under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme, the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme and the 2001 ewe premium scheme are concerned is that almost £31 million has already been paid to farmers in County Galway under these schemes. This represents 92%, 61% and 94% of applicants respectively under these schemes and compares very favourably with the payment position in other counties.</P>
    <P>A meeting will take place early next week involving officials from the Office of Public Works, the Department and staff representatives to agree both a short-term and long-term solution to the accommodation situation. The Deputies can be absolutely assured that I will do all in my power to see that this matter is brought to finality, to the satisfaction of all concerned, as speedily as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I originally wanted to raise the issue of safety of cyclists, but that was unfortunately disallowed. However, my concern is chiefly for the cyclists in this city. As we know, there was a fatal accident recently and we are simply not investing enough money into safe cycling facilities in this city and other cities. Yesterday I received a reply from the Minister in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has put together a manual entitled: &ldquo;Provision of Cycle Facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas&rdquo;, which was circulated to all local authorities in March 1998. The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of <Col N="158" />cyclists was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK. The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points.</P>
    <P>Any cyclist here knows this is theoretical. If the Minister was to get on his bicycle and go through this city he would find that this has not been properly addressed. There are some cycle ways, but on arrival in the city centre, particularly on the quays, it becomes extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>The following statistics highlight the problem. During the period 1996 to 2001, 75% of cycle fatalities, that is 15 out of the 20, inside the Dublin Corporation administrative area involved heavy goods vehicles. While the ultimate solution to this problem is to ban heavy goods vehicles in the city centre through the completion of the port tunnel, clearly we cannot wait that long. We have a very serious and dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>We should make the following investments which would not cost much. We should have restrictions on the times of day that heavy goods vehicles can pass along the quays i.e. outside the rush hours of 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Most cyclists commute during these hours so fewer conflicts will arise. This may cause inconvenience to deliveries, but inconvenience is far preferable to further deaths of cyclists.</P>
    <P>There should be restrictions on certain routes and manoeuvres. For example we should ban the left turn from Westmoreland Street to Aston Quay. We need a speed restriction of 20 miles per hour along the quays. It is disgraceful that the Department of the Environment and Local Government still has not brought in the required legislation to allow for 20 mile per hour zones. This needs to be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We need rigorous enforcement of existing traffic laws and the introduction of speed and red light cameras along the quays. We need technical measures including closed side protection along the side of heavy goods vehicles to prevent cyclists being sucked in under those vehicles. We know this has happened and has been the cause of many accidents. We need a continuous bus and cycle route from the city centre to Heuston Station and speedy implementation of the planned city centre network.</P>
    <P>All of these things can and should be done. The Minister has done a great deal of talking but has not taken action. The United Kingdom has the best overall safety record. However, when compared to Holland, for cyclists killed per 1 million kms cycled the UK is four times worse than Hol<Col N="159" />land. The key to Holland's cycling safety record is the critical mass of cyclists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised huge national random breath testing. This did not happen. He has promised a penalty points system. This has still not happened. We have only 20 speed cameras in place; the UK has about 4,500. All of these things have been promised but nothing has been done. It is getting more dangerous to cycle in this country. I ask the Minister to invest the money and answer some of the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for raising this matter. The achievement of higher levels of road safety has been and remains a high priority of this Government. Shortly after taking office work commenced on the first ever road safety strategy to be prepared by an Irish Government. The strategy, which was published in 1998, set quantified and clearly stated objectives for road safety. It also provides for a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It established quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principle of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety whose third progress report was published in July. This shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of road deaths reduced by 12.1% between 1997 and 2000. Serious injuries decreased in the 1997 to 2000 period by almost 25%; this well exceeds the target of 20% for these injuries fixed for achievement by end 2002. These reductions should be considered in the context of the heavy increases in traffic volumes and vehicle numbers over the past four to five years. Provisional returns for this year show that in relation to the reduction in the number killed on our roads, the relatively positive trends over that period is being maintained.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network with 268 schemes completed by end 2000. There has been intensified Garda enforcement activity including 224,000 on the spot fine notices for speeding to end 2000, 59,000 on the spot fines for not wearing seat belts to end 2000 and 10,433 instances of detection for drink driving to end 2000. Fixed speed cameras and mobile speed detection units have been introduced. A comprehensive public awareness and education campaign has been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" />Much has been achieved and is reflected in the lower road death and injury statistics. However, there is no such thing as an acceptable level of road fatalities and injuries. The road safety agencies and road users must continue to strive for a reduced level both of fatalities and serious injuries.</P>
    <P>The priority accorded by this Government to road safety is also seen from the increased level of funding that has been provided to the road safety agencies.</P>
    <P>In July of this year, the Minister made additional funding available to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the National Safety Council. Some £400,000 was made available to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety bringing Exchequer funding to the MBRS for 2001 to £1,395,000 &ndash; an increase of 13% on funding for 2000.</P>
    <P>An additional £350,000 was made available to the National Safety Council for public awareness activities in the road and fire safety areas. This funding together with the additional £500,000 allocated in March of 2001 brought the total Exchequer allocation to the NSC for 2001 to £1,942,000 &ndash; an increase of 105% on the 2000 allocation.</P>
    <P>In addition to Exchequer funding, the Irish Insurance Federation contributes to the National Safety Council's budget and funding is also received from sponsorship sources.</P>
    <P>When the estimated expenditure by the National Roads Authority on road safety matters is taken into account &ndash; more than £14 million &ndash; the total amount of expenditure by the Exchequer on road safety agencies under the aegis of my Department is £17.8 million in 2001. This excludes expenditure by the Garda on the enforcement of road traffic law. Such expenditure is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it is clear that progress is being made towards the achievement of strategy goals, that all agencies are fully committed to the achievement of those goals and that adequate resources are being made available to support that progress.</P>

      <P>EPI, or Europlast as it was originally, has operated in Gweedore industrial estate since 1972. The original company was taken over in 1998 by an Italian company based in Milan and since then operates as EPI, Earraí Pacallaí Idirnáisiúnta Teoranta, engaged in the manufacture of low density patch handle bags and its custom base is almost exclusively the high street retailer, such as Brown Thomas, Kilkenny Woollen Mills and Aer Rianta. It produces 70 million bags per annum which is less than 6% of the annual usage of 1.2 billion bags in this country as estimated by <Col N="161" />the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The present crisis in the company results from the Government's proposal to put a levy of 15 cent on each bag from 4 February 2002. I favour protecting the environment and we all know the devastation that can be inflicted by the discarding of cheap, low standard plastic bags throughout the country. When the Bill went through the Dáil, I spoke in support with the provision that high quality bags should be exempt.</P>
      <P>EPI employs 23 people and is considered one of the best employers in terms of pay and conditions on the Údarás na Gaeltachta estate in Bunbeg. Many workers have been there since 1972 and will find it difficult, if not impossible, to find alternative employment, particularly in Donegal where the employment rates are consistently so high. If the factory closes, many of them may spend the rest of their working lives on the unemployed register. Many are the sole bread winners of their families and have financial, mortgage and educational responsibilities that will be impossible to meet if made redundant.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of EPI's customers have already ceased to purchase its bags as they switch over to alternative paper bags. EPI, a manufacturer of high quality, reusable and 100% recyclable carrier bags, has received the last orders from its Irish customers and some of the workforce have been made redundant. The solution is to exempt these high quality bags from the levy. There is a precedent as high density, low quality carrier bags used by food stores are exempt. All major food retailers are currently ordering the new size carrier bag and as a consequence, one might say, the proposed levy will actually increase the use of the cheap, high density bag. This is the type that usually litters our countryside and probably the main reason for the introduction of the levy in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the management, union and employees of EPI and knows at first hand the drastic consequences of closure. I urge him to adopt a sympathetic response to their plight. If an exemption is granted, there is no reason this Donegal Gaeltacht industry should not continue to prosper and increase its workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of setting out the position on this matter. I am aware of the concerns expressed by EPI Teoranta in relation to the levy on plastic shopping bags, which is to be introduced in February, and its impact on the business of EPl's factory in Gweedore. The Minister met with a delegation from EPI Teoranta in Donegal on 11 October and a delegation also had detailed discussions with officials of my Department on 22 October. EPI seeks an exemption from the regulations for the low density plastic bags they manufacture.</P>
      <P>The regulations introducing the 15 cent levy on plastic shopping bags, from 4 February next, were published in draft form on 18 September. A two month consultation period was provided to give interested parties an opportunity to make comments or observations in relation to the draft regulations. This consultation period is now coming to an end and the Department is currently examining the submissions that have been made, including the case presented by EPI, to see if the draft regulations need to be adjusted before they are finalised.</P>
      <P>A number of interested parties sought changes to, or exemptions from, the regulations. For this reason it is neither desirable nor appropriate for me to address any specific submission in advance of final decisions in relation to the total consultation which has been conducted. The plastic bags levy has been the subject of substantial study and consultation so far and detailed design considerations have already been addressed arising from previous consultation. Submissions in relation to this final phase of consultation are now being evaluated and the final regulations will be made within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>This levy is being introduced because, as a society, in marked contrast to many other countries, we make profligate use of plastic bags without having any regard to the consequences. It is conservatively estimated that 1.2 billion plastic shopping bags are provided free of charge to consumers at retail outlets annually. This equates to roughly 325 plastic bags per person per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plastic bags are a visible and persistent component of litter pollution throughout the country. They impact on ecosystems, habitats and wildlife. Their prevalence suggests that we are careless about our environment and our environmental image. However, the promotion of reusable &ldquo;bags for life&rdquo; by major retail multiples in advance of the levy is a very welcome development, and one which shows that there is public demand and support for alternatives to dispos<Col N="163" />able plastic bags. Finally, while the levy will generate revenue for beneficial environmental purposes, I wish to emphasise that the primary goal in introducing it is to change consumer behaviour. <Col N="164" />I am satisfied that the public will welcome this measure and respond to it in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has provided more funding towards the provision of sporting and recreational facilities than any other in the history of the State. In addition, the Government has promoted a policy of social inclusion and prioritisation of disadvantaged areas in the schemes through which this funding is provided.</P>
      <P>Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants are allocated towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities for voluntary and community organisations throughout the country. A comprehensive review of the programme was completed by my Department in December 1998 following which a new programme was launched in 1999.</P>
      <P>In the three programmes completed since the review, i.e. 1999, 2000 and 2001, I have allocated over £100 million or &euro;127 million to 1,800 projects throughout the country. In the three year period under the previous Government, 1995-97, an overall total of less than £19.4 million or &euro;24.6 million was allocated by comparison.</P>
      <P>Resulting from the review of the programme, clearly defined objectives and assessment criteria were drawn up for its operation, which identified the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities as a major priority.</P>
      <P>Over £28.3 million or &euro;35.9 million has been allocated to projects in the city and county of Dublin in the period since the review of the programme, i.e., 1999-2001, compared with less than £4.4 million or &euro;5.6 million in the 1995-97 period.</P>
      <P>By any measurement, the northside of Dublin city has benefited enormously from sports capital funding, especially in targeted disadvantaged areas. In 2001, a total of £11 million or &euro;14 million has been allocated in sports capital funding to the city and county of Dublin to 103 projects. Of that amount, almost £6.7 million or &euro;8.5 million was allocated to 61 projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001, a total of almost £4.3 million or &euro;5.5 <Col N="166" />million was allocated in sports capital funding to 33 projects in the Dublin postal districts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 on the northside of the city.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 will be advertised shortly and it will be open to organisations in the areas in question to apply for funding under the programme.</P>
    <P>The funding of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, YPFSF, is under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science. This scheme is designed to assist in the development of strategies and initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund are 10-21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage and involvement in crime and/or drugs.</P>
    <P>Approximately £102 million or &euro;129.5 million in funding this scheme is available over the life of the national development plan, of which approximately £26 million or &euro;33 million has been allocated to date for the provision of youth orientated facilities. The type of projects and initiatives approved as part of the plans and strategies submitted to date include capital projects such as building, renovating or fitting out community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs so as to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in an area; and a number of purpose-built youth centres which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly areas such as in north Dublin city, the north inner city, Ballymun, Finglas-Cabra and Dublin north east.</P>
    <P>I feel that the details I have given clearly demonstrate the commitment of the Government to the provision of sport and recreation facilities, particularly for young people and the very considerable allocation of funding in place to ensure the availability of good quality facilities on the northside of Dublin city and in the country generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 101, 126 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>Tourism Ireland Limited &ndash; the new all island company established under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to market Ireland internationally as a tourism destination from 2002 onwards &ndash; will, in future, be responsible for international marketing, including functions previously carried out by Bord Fáilte such as Brand Ireland advertising programmes, market planning and research and the entire overseas office network.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 2001 the company launched details of the first all-island integrated marketing programme for the overseas market. In launching the programme, the chief executive stated that Tourism Ireland's immediate task in 2002 is to help the tourism industry regain the ground lost this year and position it for future growth when it happens. Key to the company's programme strategy for 2002 will be flexibility and responsiveness to markets as they change.</P>
      <P>The chief executive explained that there will be a strong emphasis on tactical marketing, with precise timing and well-directed messages. Emphasis will be placed on near source markets, both traditional segments and those seeking an alternative destination. Co-operative programmes with the industry overseas, in Northern Ireland and the South will help maximise business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Tourism Ireland also used the 7 November event to formally launch the new Tourism Brand Ireland identity, designed to reflect its new all island structure, as well as launching a new suite of marketing materials including a dynamic new television, print and tactical advertising campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the next challenge is to ensure that delivery arrangements for those tourism functions remaining with Bord Fáilte and CERT, are the most effective in helping Irish industry to achieve the optimum position for itself in the international marketplace, and so derive maximum economic benefit from the work of Tourism Ireland Limited. For this reason, the Government, on my initiative, asked the board of <Col N="168" />Bord Fáilte and the council of CERT to examine the feasibility of bringing the two bodies together to create a new national agency for the development of tourism and hospitality in Ireland and on 5 September 2001 they announced their intention to take up this invitation by Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to its product and regional marketing role, Bord Fáilte will retain responsibility for helping the Irish tourism industry to develop. This includes responsibility for tourism product investment, statutory functions for the registration and grading of certain tourist accommodation and regional tourism development through the regional tourism authorities.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte also dealt with tourism training until 1963 when the board established a dedicated agency, CERT, as a company limited by guarantee, to act as the State tourism education, recruitment and training agency. CERT has broadened its original role of training workers for the hotel sector to include all tourism and hospitality employment. More recently, in its new statement of strategy, CERT has begun moving in the direction of helping to build industry capability, focusing on human resources management and improving cost competitiveness through encouraging the adoption of best practice in all areas of operation.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the matter I consider that one agency, capable of delivering more integrated, streamlined programmes and services, might provide the best delivery model for supporting the future development of the industry in line with Government objectives.</P>
    <P>The Council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte have now considered the proposal to bring the two bodies together to create a new national agency for tourism development and the chairmen have formally reported back to me. I am pleased to report that both bodies generally support the merit of the proposal while putting forward a number of detailed views and issues for my consideration. I have considered these issues and I am currently finalising consultation with the various Departments directly affected by the proposed merger. It is my intention to report back to the Government and seek a formal decision on the way forward for implementing the proposal during the month of November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>At present, there are seven tourism regions, six of which are served by regional tourism authorities, RTAs, established by Bord Fáilte and the seventh, the mid-west, by Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>The allocation of funding to the regional tourism authorities is a matter for Bord Fáilte and I understand that details of the subvention are contained in Bord Fáilte's annual reports and accounts.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that a review of the RTAs was carried out in 1999. One of the key features to emerge from the review process was the introduction of a formal contract which would provide clarity for RTAs on critical issues such as Bord Fáilte funding, visitor servicing requirements, marketing and promotion programmes, tourism development strategy, and the co-ordination role of the RTAs. These contracts were intended to set out the role and what is expected by Bord Fáilte of the RTAs, including performance indicators. I am confident that the new contractual framework, which marks a major advance in the regional administrative structure, will give increased clarity and focus to the work of the RTAs enabling them to maximise their contribution to regional and national tourism performance.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has a regular series of meetings with the RTA managers which allow the RTA perspective an opportunity to inform BFE policy and, indeed, its ongoing briefing both of myself and my Department. Following the tragic events in the United States on 11 September, both myself and officials from my Department have met regularly with senior management from both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island marketing company, and with a high level delegation from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, which represents all strands of the industry, to take stock of the situation and to ensure an appropriate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited, I announced that I was considering the best way to utilise the resources and functions remaining with Bord Fáilte and those of the State tourism training agency, CERT. I believe that by bringing the two bodies together to create a new national agency for tourism development, Ireland will be very well placed to achieve the optimum position for itself in the international marketplace, and so derive maximum economic benefit from the work of Tourism Ireland Limited. Any arrangements emerging from this process will of course have to take account of the role and functions of the RTAs and how they can most effectively be delivered within any new <Col N="170" />framework for the delivery of national tourism policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Despite the recent slowdown in economic activity, the Government is committed to ensuring that adequate funding is available for social inclusion measures, as envisaged in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the RAPID programme fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to identify the 25 most disadvantaged areas in the country and develop a focus across the social inclusion measures in the NDP. RAPID will ensure that priority attention is given to these areas by Departments, local authorities and State agencies through frontloading funding which is available to them for these areas under the NDP. By targeting investment under the NDP at the 25 identified areas, it is intended that this initiative will benefit 165,000 people.</P>
      <P>An area implementation team with the support of a local co-ordinator has been appointed to each of the 25 areas and they are working towards the completion of area action plans before the end of the year. These plans will be the blueprint for prioritisation within these areas for the NDP during 2002 and 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area implementation teams include representatives from all relevant Departments and State agencies as well as representatives <Col N="171" />from the voluntary and community sector and local residents. The representatives from Departments and State agencies will ensure that their agency's input into the programme is effectively managed and resourced and that negotiations take place with other Departments or agencies on issues of service co-ordination and integration. The teams will also ensure that local community representatives are consulted in relation to service delivery and agency specific responses are developed in response to issues identified as a priority.</P>
    <P>A national monitoring committee is also being established to monitor the implementation of the programme at national level and to report on progress to Government through the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The committee, which will be chaired by Maureen Gaffney, will begin its work in January and will include representatives from all relevant Departments, State agencies, the voluntary and community sector and the social partners.</P>
    <P>In so far as the work of the area partnership companies are concerned, there is no change from the provision of £220 million included under the local development measure of the two regional operational programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>Firstly, Bord Fáilte has not requested a meeting with me with a view to rearranging the grants scheme. The tourism product investment scheme is to be funded under the local enterprise development priority of the BMW and the S&amp;E regional operational programmes. It will be implemented by Bord Fáilte Éireann. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product, in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas, and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>It is very clear that the tourism sector is currently facing severe difficulties that could never have been imagined last year, when the scheme was notified to Brussels. However, I am convinced that the underlying strategy in relation to support for investment in tourism product development is still relevant and valid.</P>
      <P>This is the &ldquo;third round&rdquo; of European Regional Development Fund supported capital investment in the tourism sector. However, it has been the first occasion on which formal notification under the state aids rules and clearance by the Competition Directorate of the European Commission has been required for each individual measure before the scheme could be launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was formally notified, as required by the relevant regulations, in October last year. Over the past 12 months, negotiations between my Department and the Competition Directorate have been long and unexpectedly difficult. In line with my firm commitment to support and facilitate the development of balanced and sustainable tourism, officials negotiated with the Commission to ensure that there was a very real appreciation of the contribution of the tourism sector to the Irish economy and of the importance of the <Col N="173" />scheme for simulating regional development. I am pleased to report that the Commission has finally approved the scheme as compatible with the treaty.</P>
    <P>The current position is that Bord Fáilte, in consultation with my Department, is re-examining its draft guidelines for project promoters, in the light of the very detailed conditions laid down in the Commission's formal decision. I hope to formally launch the scheme, as cleared by the European Commission, in the near future.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in a written reply on 6 November last, a contract to provide executive services has been completed by CSID with Magahy and Company. The contract is for a five year period, but it contains a provision for earlier termination in certain circumstances, with a provision for compensation. Approval has also been given for a number of smaller contracts for technical surveys relating to services and preparatory work on the site. Much of the survey work has already been completed at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Government has given approval to proceed with the development of an aquatic and leisure Centre at the site in Abbotstown. In July 2000, the project went to tender, offering a contract for the design, build, operation, maintaining and financing of the centre. Heads of agreement have been signed by CSID and terms of agreement are currently at the stage of final negotiations. Meanwhile, as the aim is to have the pool at Abbotstown completed in time for the Special Olympics in 2003 work has begun on the site under a letter of intent which includes provision for termination.</P>
      <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited has sought tenders for the provision of a stadium and other sporting facilities for the Sports Campus Ireland project, under EU procurement directives on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. However, this tendering process is still under way and contract terms, including any exit provisions, will not arise until a preferred bidder has been selected and the final contract negotiation process commences.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the overview of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project has been completed by consultants High-Point Rendel. This report has been presented to the steering group of senior officials appointed by Government to oversee the work. As soon as I receive a final report from the steering group I intend submitting it to Government for consideration and in the meantime no further statement will be made.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, presented their report entitled, Maximising Ireland's Potential in the International Conference Market, to Bord Fáilte Éireann in late August. I received Bord Fáilte Éireann's formal response to the report on 24 October. The report is now being considered by relevant Departments in the context of future policy in relation to the development of international conference business into Ireland. Decisions as to publication will be made once those deliberations are completed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that the report was specifically commissioned to facilitate consideration of the general issue of optimising Ireland's share of the international conference market of which physical conference infrastructure is but one component.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 111 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I have advised the House previously that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, estimate the cost of Sports Campus Ireland, including estimates in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, A Stadium for the New Century, to be £550 million, of which some £350 million would be provided by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions, the independent consultants, High-Point Rendel, have completed the overview of the cost of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project, and their report has been presented to the steering group of senior officials appointed by Government to oversee the work. As soon as I receive the final report from the steering group with their advice, I intend submitting it to Government for its consideration. I have already indicated to the House that until the report has been considered by Government, I do not intend to make any statement on its contents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as I indicated in reply to another question today, terms of agreement for the pool at Abbotstown are currently at the stage of final negotiations while work has already begun on site under a letter of intent in order to have the pool completed in time for the Special Olympics in 2003. I am informed by CSID that the pool is currently on target for completion by end 2002.</P>
      <P>The closing date for the receipt of outline bids for the stadium and other sporting facilities at Sports Campus Ireland was 21 June last. According to an announcement by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, five bidders have indicated that they will be participants in the bidding process for the construction of these facilities. The outline bid phase is still under way. In any event, no decision will be made on any of these bids until the Government has considered the report of the consultants on the cost overview.</P>

      <P>My Department, as published in its statement of strategy, has responsibility for formulation, development and evaluation of policy for the tourism sector as regards training, <Col N="176" />human resource policy, tourism marketing and promotion, tourism structures, tourism product development and North-South co-operation in tourism matters. Implementation of these policies is, however, a matter for the tourism agencies under the aegis of the Department &ndash; Bord Fáilte, CERT, Shannon Development and Tourism Ireland Limited.</P>
      <P>The Department's strategy for tourist product development is clearly set out in the national development plan and in the tourism measure within the regional operational programme complements. It is based on a longer term strategy where the focus for future capital grant investment will be on giving some of the less developed tourism areas their opportunity to produce new proposals that will allow them evolve into new tourism growth centres.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for operational, day-to-day matters in relation to tourism product, including the heritage town programme, is a matter for Bord Fáilte Éireann. I should add that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands also has responsibilities in relation to preservation and presentation of heritage generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants are allocated towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities for voluntary and community organisations throughout the country. A comprehensive review of the programme was completed by my Department in December 1998 following which a new programme was launched in 1999.</P>
      <P>Under this programme detailed assessment criteria were introduced to improve the selection process and a huge increase in funding has been provided by the Government, as indicated by the fact that total funding under the programme has increased by 640% between 1998 and 2001, from £6 million or &euro;7.6 million to over £44.2 million or &euro;56.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed on an individual basis by officials in the sports division of my Department in accordance with the detailed assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme, which are available on hard copy and on the Department's website at www.tourism-sport.irlgov.ie. Among the factors covered by the criteria are the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the extent to <Col N="177" />which the project will increase participation in such areas; current and planned levels of sport and/or recreational sport facilities in the area and the priority of proposed improvements or facilities in relation to existing facilities; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds both geographically, having regard to existing facilities, and among different sports and community groups; the extent to which the project will increase the levels of active participation in sport and/or recreational sport; the financial viability of the project, the level of own funding available by the applicant towards the project and the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Following the assessment process each application receives a score, which decides its order of priority within its own county. Regard is had to the population levels in each county and to providing a <i>pro rata</i> level of funding on that basis. Up to 2000, using this <i>pro rata</i> process, the number of projects funded in some counties and the level of grant awarded were unlikely to make a significant impact of the provision of facilities in that county. Therefore, for the 2000 programme, I decided to introduce a guaranteed minimum allocation of £200,000 or &euro;253,948 per county.</P>
    <P>However, the assessment process must also take into account existing levels of facilities in an area and also the strategic positioning of major facilities which may be required and the quality of applications received for such projects. Applications under the programme are received from organisations for local, regional and national facilities. Each year a number of major regional and national projects are allocated funding, following consultations with the Irish Sports Council, other Departments and the relevant national governing bodies of sport and local authorities, as applicable, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. The level of this funding may distort the total allocations to the counties in which they are located.</P>
    <P>Recommendations, based on the conclusions from the assessment process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, are made by the sports division to me as Minister, and I make the final decision on projects and grants to be allocated under the programme.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that all counties have benefited tremendously from the increased funding I have secured for the sports capital programme and all have received substantially greater funding from 1998 to 2001 than in preceding years. In 2000 and 2001 alone, I allocated a total of over £80 million or &euro;102 million in sports capital funding for the provision of facilities for the parishes, towns and cities of Ireland. I have allocated over £106 million or &euro;135 million since this Government took office, compared with a total of less than £19.4 million or &euro;24.6 million allocated in the preceding three years, 1995-97, under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" />I am quite happy that this massive investment in the sporting facilities of the country has been allocated in the fairest and most equitable manner possible.</P>

To date this year, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, the company set up to oversee the development of the Sports Campus Ireland project, has received a total of almost £15 million from that subhead and prior to that a total of just under £2.5 million was paid out by the Department of the Taoiseach during 2000, when that Department had responsibility for the project. CSID awarded a contract for the provision of executive services to a team headed by Magahy and Company Limited. Under the contract the cost of the executive services team has been capped at 1.8% of development costs and payments to the company are made by CSID.</P>

      <P>The feasibility study, A Stadium for the New Century, which is available in the Library of the House and on the Web, includes a section, &ldquo;Economic Impact Assessment&rdquo;, which deals with the social and economic impact, including job creation, of the proposed stadium. It was estimated that during the construction phase of the project a total of 7,506 full time jobs could be created while 23 permanent and 560 event related operating jobs would be created following completion of the construction phase.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the independent overview of the cost of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project stated that the consultants should also &ldquo;ascertain the direct and indirect benefits&rdquo; of the project. This would include estimates for the potential for job creation from the project. The terms of reference did not require either set of consultants to comment on the possible use of Sports Campus Ireland as a home venue for a soccer team in a new European league as no such proposal has been put forward for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council is currently piloting the new concept of local sports partnerships &ndash; LSPs. Eight LSPs were selected, after open competition, for the pilot scheme and these are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North. They receive an annual allocation of £90,000 or &euro;114,276 from the Sports Council. Four other areas &ndash; Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford &ndash; are currently involved in an extensive development process with a view to joining the pilot programme in 2002. It is intended to have completed an evaluation of the pilot by mid 2003 and the proven effectiveness of the concept will determine the final shape and structure of the concept for extension to other areas from end 2003. The aims of this partnership initiative, which is new to Irish sport and untested, are to create greater opportunities for participation by all in sport and to ensure that resources are co-ordinated and used to their best efforts at a local level.</P>

Team Ireland Golf is a programme, part funded by the Irish Sports Council and Bord Fáilte and part funded by commercial sponsors, which financially supports professional golfers at the start of their careers on the various professional golf tours. The administration of Team Ireland Golf is the responsibility of the Irish Sports Council and, like the carding scheme, grants are awarded on the basis of performance record, coaching, training and competitive programme, proposals for progression in the sport and financial requirements. The Irish Sports Council also provides funding to the Golfing Union of Ireland and the Irish Ladies Golfing Union to assist with the participation of top amateur golfers in high level international competitions.</P>

      <P>The new national drugs strategy was launched in May last. The overall cost of implementing the various actions outlined in the strategy is not readily available as the recommendations contained in the strategy come within the area of responsibility of a number of Government Departments and State agencies. The necessary funding for individual Departments and agencies to implement these recommendations will be dealt with in the context of the annual Estimates process both this year and in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" />With regard to the amount of illegal drugs consumed here in 1990 and 2000, the Deputy will appreciate that, given the illegal nature of the activity, there is no authoritative information available on this subject. However, according to the annual reports of the Garda Síochána the number of drugs possession offences in 1990 was 2,071 while the figure for 1999 was 7,136. The quantity of Garda seizures for selected drugs in the years 1990 and 1999 are set out in the tabular statement which I propose to ask An Ceann Comhairle to circulate with the Official Report. The figures for 2000 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>As regards the numbers receiving methadone treatment, the central methadone treatment list was established in 1993 and the earliest complete figures that are available are for 1994. The number of places available for methadone treatment at the end of 1994 was 1,377 and the comparable figure for end 2000 was 5,032. In this context, the Deputy should note that there is a commitment under the national drugs strategy to having 6,000 methadone treatment places by end 2001 and 6,500 by end 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 113, 121, 236 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>I asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of Ireland's preparation for and participation in the Sydney Olympics, including the supports, programmes and schemes which were put in place leading up to the Games. The report of the review, including recommendations for the Athens 2004 Olympics, was published on 6 February 2001. The report outlined 29 recommendations for the key agencies involved in order to bring about the radical change that is required for success in 2004 and beyond. The review steering group identified the Irish Sports Council as the body best placed to oversee implementation of these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Sports Council has met the key agencies, including the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI), National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) and the National Coaching and Training Centre (NCTC) and all parties have committed themselves to the recommendations and to the spirit of co-operation required in the lead up to Athens 2004 and beyond.</P>
      <P>The council also established a high performance committee to assist and advise the council in the development of a high performance strategy for Irish sport, which has recently been completed and which is currently being considered by my Department. A wide range of interests were represented on the committee including the athletes, NGBs, the NCTC, the OCI, the Paralympic Council of Ireland, Sports Campus Ireland, my Department and the Sports Council Northern Ireland. A review of the future role and structure of the NCTC is currently under way and a new board of management as well as a new memorandum of agreement and terms of reference for the centre's operation are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commenting on the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Sydney review group it is important to highlight the process and the role played by the national governing bodies of sport in the preparation of our elite athletes and teams for international competition. With the aid of financial support and advice from the Irish Sports Council, the NGBs train and employ coaches, organise training camps and prepare teams to compete in major international events such as the Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships and home internationals. The work of the other <Col N="184" />bodies such as the NCTC, OCI and Paralympic Council should all be seen in the context of supporting and underpinning the work of the NGBs on behalf of their athletes.</P>
    <P>With that important role in mind, the Sports Council has worked very closely with the NGBs to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, and the need for strategic planning; the achievement of value for money and the introduction of measurement criteria.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies of Olympic sports have already commenced the development of performance plans for their sports and a liaison group has been established between the Sports Council and the OCI to help maintain liaison and co-operation between them and, very importantly, to drive and monitor the implementation of the Sydney review recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any study, which compares the range of coaching, training and management facilities available here and the various other supports which exist for our elite sports persons with those in other EU countries. I am satisfied that the preparations for future Olympic success are well under way and that satisfactory co-operation is being achieved thus far in the process from all concerned. Under the terms of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, funding for national governing bodies is an operational matter for the council.</P>

      <P>The new national drugs strategy, launched in May last, aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. These actions will be implemented by a range of different Departments and agencies which will drive the strategy forward.</P>
      <P>I chair the interdepartmental group on drugs (IDG), which meets monthly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set out in the strategy. Any obstacle to the implementation of any of the actions can be brought to the attention of the IDG at these meetings. A progress report on the implementation of the strategy will be presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion every six months. The first progress report is due next month. In addition, all Government Departments and agencies involved in the strategy must prepare critical implementation paths. These will set out the steps they propose to take to ensure that the actions set for them in the strategy are met. These plans are due by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Amongst the actions recommended in the strategy is that regional drugs task forces be established throughout the country. These task forces are due to be set up in every health board area by the end of the year, including the three area health boards that comprise the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The new task forces will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors and the secretariat will be provided by the relevant health board. They will be responsible for putting in place a strategy to tackle drug misuse specifically for their regions.</P>
      <P>A series of 10 regional seminars were held by my Department and the national drugs strategy team (NDST) to provide information on the strategy and to lay the foundations for the setting up of the regional drugs task forces. In this context, it should be noted that the NDST are currently drafting guidelines for the new task forces. Representatives of the area based partnerships will be invited to sit on the regional drugs task forces and I expect them to play an important part in their ongoing work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the speech to which the Deputy refers, I referred to the Government's promotion of social inclusion policies and the vital role that sport plays in this regard. I went on to state my belief that if sport is to develop within Ireland, it must be fostered at local level within all communities and I praised the role of the thousands of volunteers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has already established a number of ways in which sport promotes social inclusion. Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, grants are provided to sports clubs <Col N="187" />and voluntary community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities. Some of the aims and objectives of the programme are: to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are treated on their merits with the highest priority being afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. In 2001 grants totalling £44.2 million or &euro;56.2 million were allocated to 703 projects under the programme. Out of this total almost £25.5 million or &euro;32.3 million was allocated to 382 projects in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund was established in 1998, in the context of the Government's national drugs strategy, to assist in the development of preventative strategies and initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund are ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and/or drugs.</P>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of over £26 million or &euro;33 million has been allocated to date for the provision of youth orientated facilities. The type of projects and initiatives approved as part of the plans and strategies submitted to date include the following: capital projects such as building, renovating or fitting out community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs so as to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most at risk young people in an area; and a number of purpose built youth centres which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly those areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, where there is a dearth of dedicated youth facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the designated areas scheme is designed to help combat the problems of drug abuse, crime and social exclusion, particularly among young people in areas of social and econ<Col N="188" />omic disadvantage. The Sports Council allocated a budget of almost £813,000 or &euro;1,032,297 for selected national governing bodies of sport for a three year period to help the selected governing bodies to set up programmes aimed at helping young people at risk to overcome the isolating effects of social exclusion in designated areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the speech referred to by the Deputy I specifically mentioned the local sports partnerships initiative which the Irish Sports Council is currently piloting. Eight were selected, after open competition, for the pilot scheme and these are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo and north Tipperary. They receive an annual allocation of £90,000 or &euro;114,276 from the Sports Council. Four other areas &ndash; Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford &ndash; are currently involved in an extensive development process with a view to joining the pilot programme in 2002. It is intended to have completed an evaluation of the pilot by mid-2003 and the proven effectiveness of the concept will determine the final shape and structure of the concept for extension to other areas from the end of 2003. The aims of this partnership initiative, which is new to Irish sport and untested, are to create greater opportunities for participation by all in sport and to ensure that resources are co-ordinated and used to their best efforts at a local level.</P>

      <P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy, the CREST retail network, is one of a number of networks supported by the training networks programme. The programme, which is operated by Skillnets Ltd, was initiated by the social partners with funding from my Department and the European Social Fund. It is a pilot programme which is designed to examine the potential of networking as a model for enterprise-led training.</P>
      <P>The programme commenced in 1999 and is scheduled to complete its operations at the end of March 2002. Sixty networks have contracted with Skillnets to carry out specified training programmes within the overall timeframe and budgetary envelope of the pilot programme.</P>
      <P>The initiative is currently the subject of a major external evaluation commissioned by my Department. The evaluation will be concluded shortly and I will be considering whether further State support should be provided for the programme in the future, taking into account the evaluator's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of the programme being con<Col N="196" />tinued, decisions on the allocation of further funding to individual networks will remain a matter for the board of Skillnets.</P>

      <P>The &lsquo;European Competitiveness Report 2001', which has just been prepared by the European Commission, shows Ireland in an extremely favourable light in comparison with other member states of the European Union. Ireland is one of just three states cited as recording high rates of GDP growth, while scoring very high both in terms of employment growth and labour productivity growth. In terms of GDP per capita in EU member states Ireland is ranked second after Luxembourg for 2001 and we are, in fact, in first place as regards growth of real GDP in member states ranked according to performance over the period 1995 to 2001.</P>
      <P>We are also in first place as regards both employment growth and labour productivity in member states, as shown by the average annual growth of GDP employed persons in per cent, ranked according to performance over the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition to these macro indicators, the report also points out that Ireland &ndash; in common with some of the Nordic countries &ndash; is approaching US levels of business investment in ICT as a percentage of GDP. I am satisfied that, with a continuation of our successful policies, adjusted to take account of changing economic conditions, we will be in a position to maintain our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis </i>the other member states of the EU for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is an active labour market programme for persons unemployed for five years or longer and over 35 years of age. There were 2,736 persons participating on JI at the start of November 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1996-1997 with 1,000 places available in phase 1. The maximum number of places available on <Col N="197" />the programme has remained constant since 1999 at 2,875 per annum and will remain at this level for the foreseeable future. The primary objective of JI is to assist long-term unemployed persons to prepare for work opportunities available in the open labour market.</P>
    <P>As provided under the programme for prosperity and fairness, an overall review of active labour market programmes is to be undertaken and discussions in this regard have recently commenced with the social partners represented on the Standing Committee on the Labour Market. The future policy direction of programmes such as JI will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <P>The Government has expressed its deep concern on a number of occasions at the horrendous loss of life and the human suffering caused by the civil conflict in Algeria.</P>
      <P>Efforts on the part of the Algerian authorities and of a number of opposition groups aimed at ending the ten years of civil conflict continue. However, there is continued opposition by some forces in Algeria to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. The security situation has seriously deteriorated in recent months after an improvement following the implementation of the general amnesty announced by President Bouteflika last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and our partners in the European Union continue to encourage and support efforts to achieve a process of genuine political dialogue in Algeria designed to end the current violence. The EU supports economic and social reforms in Algeria which would respond to the needs of the <Col N="199" />general population and tackle the underlying poverty, deprivation and sense of exclusion which perpetuate the violence. To this end, the EU is working with Algeria through the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Barcelona Declaration.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights, the EU continues to urge Algeria to implement the commitments it accepted in the Barcelona Declaration for the development of democracy and the rule of law, and to respect and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. These are priority areas for the EU in the negotiations with Algeria of a draft association agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Ireland would like to see an agreement in which closer economic co-operation is linked to the process of political reform in Algeria and respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland attaches particular importance to human rights issues in our bilateral relations with Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will hopefully lead to an ending of the conflict, and to establish independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and to bring those responsible to justice. We would like Algeria to respond positively to the requests for visits by the UN special human rights rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial executions.</P>
    <P>The Government has noted the constructive action taken by the Algerian authorities in response to the recent critical report and recommendations of an independent inquiry established by President Bouteflika into the causes of the unrest in the Berber region of Kabylie. The Government hopes that there will be further follow-up action to those recommendations. We hope the Algerian authorities will now go on to establish similar, independent mechanisms to investigate allegations of human rights abuses arising from the wider civil conflict in the country.</P>

      <P>The first Luas line from Tallaght to Connolly Station, crossing the Liffey at Heuston Station, is on target for completion and commencement of passenger services by the end of 2003. I will bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks for the development of the metro. In terms of services to the north side of the city, it is likely that the first phase of the system will involve construction of a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the city centre. I hope that the procurement process for this line can begin shortly thereafter. The line will be procured as a public-private partnership and, therefore, the precise route alignment, cost and timescale will be negotiated as part of this process. Information available to me suggests that the construction of this line could be completed by 2006-07.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has also proposed an extension of the Luas network covering various parts of northside Dublin. While initial planning and preliminary public consultation work on these lines has commenced, no formal dates for commencement of construction have yet been determined.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new area based compensatory allowance <Col N="204" />scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland, £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland, £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares and mountain-type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The person named was paid £782.55 on 25 September 2001 in respect of 17.39 hectares of mountain-type land at £45 per hectare, together with an additional sum of £428.45 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount paid under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

A valid application is a fully completed application accompanied by all the necessary supporting documentation indicating the conditions for payment have been met.</P>
      <P>In this case, the application was not deemed valid because section 12 consents in respect of her farming transferee's enlargement land were not received until July 2000, seven months after the closing date for receipt of valid applications.

      <P>When my Department notified the person named that her application had been rejected, she was also advised that she appeared to be eligible to apply for the new early retirement scheme introduced in November 2000.

      <P>The Control of Horses Act, 1996, was introduced to address the problem of wandering horses, mainly in urban areas. The Act assigns to local authorities the primary role for dealing with wandering horses and provides for the designation, by local authority by-laws, of control areas in which horses cannot be kept without a licence.</P>
      <P>The Act has also resulted in the establishment of equine projects for horse owners, where the relevant local authority has considered that its support for such a project is consistent with the implementation of the Act. My Department is empowered by the Act to make grants available to local authorities towards expenses they incur in implementing the Act. Any grant assistance where horse projects are involved is and can only be provided to the relevant local authority, which must have an actual involvement in the project.</P>
      <P>To date, three horse projects have been assisted under the Act. These were Fettercairn, Cherry Orchard and Quarryvale in Dublin. The amounts involved were £391,914, £1,425,296 and £3,872, respectively, totalling £1,821,083. Subject to resource constraints, my Department will continue to support projects of this kind provided they are advocated and supported by the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>The production of sugar in all member states of the European Union, including Ireland, is regulated by the EU sugar regime, which has been in operation since 1968. The EU regulation specifies a sugar quota for each member state and provides that the quota be allocated to the sugar manufacturing enterprises on the member state's territory. In Ireland's case the quota is allocated to Irish Sugar plc, the only manufacturer of sugar in the country. It is a matter for the sugar manufacturer to place contracts with farmers to deliver sugar beet sufficient to allow for the production of the sugar quota. The EU regulation also specifies that the manufacturer must pay to the grower at least the minimum price for sugar beet of standard quality and sugar content. Any additional amount is a matter for negotiation between the two parties.</P>
      <P>The present regime will apply until the end of the 2005-06 marketing year and I am satisfied that the regime operates very well in ensuring a reasonable and secure standard of living and income for Community growers of sugar beet and cane a constant supply of sugar beet and sugar cane to the sugar manufacturing industry and a continued supply of high quality sugar at reasonable prices to consumers both industry and domestic.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the present dispute between the sugar beet growers and Irish Sugar plc, and I am very anxious that the matter be resolved quickly to the satisfaction of both sides. I urge the two sides to do everything possible to find an acceptable solution. In this context, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is meeting both sides today in an effort to seek to resolve the matter.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works act as agent on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in the acquisition of sites for new school facilities. Site proposals to meet the requirements for a new Gaelscoil facility in Westport were sought by public advertisement in May 2001 and several site options are under consideration at present. Preliminary consultations with the owners of these sites have taken place. The Office of Public Works is also engaged in a pre-planning consultation with the local authority regarding the siting of a new school facility. It is expected to complete the initial assessment of site options by the end of the year at which time Office of Public Works will forward its recommendations to the Department of Education and Science for consideration.</P>

      <P>I did not receive any communication on this matter from the company mentioned in the details supplied by the Deputy or any individual associated with it.</P>
      <P>The actual position is that the taxation advisers to the relevant employee share ownership trust &ndash; ESOT &ndash; sought clarification about how the existing legislation governing the tax treatment of ESOTs would apply in the event of a takeover of the relevant company being successful. The advice which I received from the Revenue Commissioners and my Department was that if a particular bid were successful, an amendment to the ESOT legislation would be required if the tax benefits currently provided to members of the ESOT were to be maintained. Having considered the matter, I indicated that I was prepared to propose an amendment to the relevant legislation in the context of the Finance Bill, 2002. The changes that I intend to bring forward will be designed to maintain the existing tax benefits that can accrue to the relevant ESOT. It will not provide any additional tax benefits. I should mention that such changes will also apply to any other ESOT that is in a similar unforeseen situation and will not change the essential principles of the scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, as a result of representations from trades unions and others, I have made amendments to the tax legislation governing ESOTs on a number of occasions to facilitate ESOTs in changing circumstances to ensure they retain the tax benefits available to them.</P>
      <P>My Department has received a number of requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, on this matter. I understand that the deciding officer decided that all of the relevant documents should be released apart from those which are still part of the deliberative process. However, this decision is now the subject of an appeal by an interested party to the Information Commissioner and no documents can be released until the appeal has been finalised.</P>

      <P>I set out in my budget speech the background to the abolition of the PRSI contribution ceiling for employers. As I said at the time, the initiative had to be seen in the context of the substantial reductions in business taxes in the 2001 and previous budgets. In addition, I also announced in the budget a significant change in the capital allowances regime for plant and machinery which substantially benefited a wide range of enterprises.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the ceiling affected only employers where their employee's annual salary was greater than £36,600 &ndash;&euro;46,472. In addition, the measure had little impact in 2001 due to the short tax year. Our Employer PRSI system continues to compare very favourably with the EU norm. Moreover, I am not aware the abolition has had any effect on employment from the data I have seen.</P>
      <P>I recently met with the representatives of the main employers' organisations as part of the pre-budget process and I noted all their concerns and suggestions, which I will bear in mind when framing my budget. They are also fully aware of my intention to continue to reform and simplify the PRSI system which has been very complex and cumbersome from an operational perspective over many years.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the case is as follows. The person concerned tested positive for hepatitis C in October 1997 while she and her family were resident in the State. Subsequently, she claimed travelling and subsistence expenses from the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme operated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>ex gratia</i> scheme was introduced in 1994 to ensure that persons who had contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products made available by the BTSB did not undergo any undue hardship in availing of medical treatment for their condition. The <i>ex gratia</i> payments are made on an interim basis, pending the award of compensation by the hepatitis C compensation tribunal or by the <Col N="213" />courts and are not contingent on continued residence within the State.</P>
    <P>The BTSB made <i>ex gratia</i> payments totalling £2,061 to the person concerned between November 1997 and April 1998. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments are usually made on production of receipts. However, following representations from Positive Action in December 1997, arrangements were made to pay the person in advance. In order to continue making payments the BTSB required medical evidence that anti-D had in fact been administered to her. It wrote to the person on 5 June, 15 June and 7 July 1998 requesting this confirmation. No such confirmation has been provided to the BTSB to date. The BTSB ceased making <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the person in April 1998.</P>
    <P>A serious dispute has emerged in this case between the person and the Western Health Board regarding the source of her hepatitis C infection. The person believes that the source was infected anti-D administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar hospital in March 1993. She alleges that a medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. The board stated that its medical records show that anti-D was not administered to the person while she was under its care in March 1993.</P>
    <P>The person's family requested the Garda to investigate whether anti-D was administered to her in Castlebar hospital and whether her hospital records had been materially altered. Gardaí visited the hospital on 28 October and 16 November 1998 regarding this investigation, and, at the request of the hospital, took a number of records away for forensic examination. Neither I nor the Western Health Board have been informed of the results of that examination.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to seek such information from the Garda authorities. However, I should say that the Western Health Board accepts that the person's record was amended, but is fully satisfied that the amended record reflects the accurate position which is that the person never received anti-D. The board does not accept that the record had been inappropriately changed and the medical consultant in charge of the person's care while in Castlebar hospital is adamant that the person never received the anti-D product.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has had a sequencing test carried out on a blood sample from the person concerned. Tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the department of medical microbiology, University of Edinburgh, indicated that the source of the person's hepatitis C infection was not the anti-D product manufactured by the BTSB. The laboratory's findings are disputed by the person concerned.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, indicated on numerous occasions to the person concerned and her family that he considered that the hepatitis C compensation tribunal was the most appropriate forum in which to have this matter resolved. The <Col N="214" />tribunal has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities. On 30 June 1998 an offer was made to the person to arrange an early hearing on the causation issue alone, independent of considerations of compensation. In addition, as the person is now living abroad, my Department offered as an exceptional measure to arrange financial assistance for herself and her family to facilitate their attendance at the compensation tribunal. It was also explained to the person that while the tribunal does not normally compensate persons in respect of health care requirements, claimants to the tribunal who are ordinarily resident outside the State may apply to the tribunal for health care costs.</P>
    <P>During 2000 the person's legal representatives informed my Department that their client would be attending the hepatitis C compensation tribunal and the necessary arrangements were made by my Department to cover the expenses which she would incur in attending the tribunal. As the hepatitis C compensation tribunal is independent in its operation of both myself and my Department, I am not in a position to confirm the outcome of the hearing. I understand from representations made on the person's behalf, however, that she withdrew her case from the compensation tribunal before any determination had been made, with the intention of pursuing the case directly through the High Court and I have been informed by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor that High Court proceedings have been initiated by her.</P>
    <P>However, I remain of the view that the most expeditious way to resolve the matter is for the person to apply to return to the compensation tribunal as soon as possible. The tribunal has the confidence of the four support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration of infected blood and blood products, and over 1,400 individuals have had their claims determined by the tribunal to date.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law does not lay down upper age limits for adopting parents, but adoption agencies generally apply their own age limits for domestic adoption. There are a number of reasons the agencies apply age limits as follows: the birth mothers are involved in the choice of adopters and have a preference for younger parents; the decline in the number of children being placed for adoption means that adopters have to wait a substantial period following the assessment before a child may be placed by which time they would be a few years older and the expectation that a child would be placed with a family where it is likely that the parents would be in a position to care for them appropriately until they reach adulthood.</P>
      <P>At present there is no specific age limit which would exclude a couple from being assessed for intercountry adoption, however, age is a factor which would be taken into account in assessing capacity. As with domestic adoption this requires that the assessing social worker is satisfied that the child is likely to have parents who are in a position to care for them appropriately until they reach adulthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is considered that the adoptive <Col N="216" />child should not be exposed to a special situation to any greater extent than the adoption itself involves by being placed in a family which deviates in terms of age from that of other children in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which will be dealt with in the context of the proposed legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption is age limits for people wishing to adopt domestically or intercountry. When making decisions in this matter I will take into account the views expressed by the Adoption Board, the various stakeholders during the consultative process on the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention and the recommendation contained in the report entitled Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures. I will be submitting the heads of the Bill to Government shortly. I can confirm that any age limit would apply at the time of application for assessment with transitional arrangements for those already on the waiting list for adoption.</P>

      <P>The statutory responsibility for the delivery of occupational therapy services in County Roscommon rests with the Western Health Board. I have been advised by that board that the filling of the vacancy for the post of occupational therapist in County Roscommon which arose on the 13 November 2001 will be advertised within the coming weeks. The board has also advised me that the person who held the post was responsible for covering services throughout the county and not just in the south of Roscommon.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of occupational therapy services generally in this area, the board has indicated that the Irish Wheelchair Association has a lead role for providing such services and receives funding from the board for such provision. I understand that the Western Health Board has been in contact with the Deputy in connection with this matter.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991 everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services, subject only to modest statutory charges from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £26 per night, subject to a maximum of £260 in any 12 month period, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or <Col N="218" />not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services in individual cases is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. In this instance, the chief executive officer of the then Eastern Health Board considered this particular case and following a clinical review by a health board consultant cardiologist decided there were no grounds on which to allow the request for payment of the private hospital bill by the health board. The person involved has been advised of the outcome of the review.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 360 of 13 November 2001. I have already indicated my willingness to extend the consultation period for a number of weeks to help the solid fuel trade and other interested parties to engage constructively with my Department and finalise their views. However, while a reasonable extension of time is possible, it will need to be limited to minimise uncertainty in the solid fuel industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation paper considers, <i>inter alia</i>, the economic impacts of a national coal ban including trade and employment impacts. I have some preliminary views from the solid fuel industry on these issues and the potential impacts on the distribution of fuel, including in rural areas. I would welcome the considered views of the industry and <Col N="220" />others on all these aspects in the light of the points raised in the consultation paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5, (&euro;6.35) per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3, (&euro;3.81) per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8, (&euro;10.16) per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3, (&euro;3.81) per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>As announced in last year's budget, the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season was extended by two weeks in April and now also commences one week earlier in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, the increases in primary payments that I introduced in the three budgets since the scheme was reviewed have provided for a substantial real increase after fully <Col N="226" />compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation. The increases in primary payments of £8, (&euro;10.16) to £10, (&euro;12.70) per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. Any further changes in the scheme would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, usage of the Irish language varies throughout the Gaeltacht areas being strong and weak in varying degrees. Substantial and wide ranging information has been collated and published by the Central Statistics Office on the usage of the Irish language in the State in general and also in the Gaeltacht areas. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the Irish language section of the principal socio-<Col N="227" />economic results of the 1996 Census of Population, which was published by the CSO in April 1998.</P>
      <P>The Government established An Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht in April 2000. Its terms of reference include establishing and analysing from available data &ndash; including the Census of Population returns and statistics from Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge administered by my Department &ndash; the extent to which Irish is the spoken vernacular in the various Gaeltacht areas. The report of this commission is expected by the end of the year and I look forward to its analysis of the matter and its recommendations arising therefrom.</P>
      <P>I also refer the Deputy to the reply to a somewhat similar question of 14 December last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 204, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that when the Gaeltacht allowance was introduced in 1934, it was decided that it would only be paid in areas where Irish was the general medium of speech and where all the members of the force were proficient in and required to perform their duties in Irish. The areas where the allowance was to be paid were determined on the basis of districts. These are Garda administrative areas, each comprising of a number of Garda stations, under the supervision of a superintendent. It was not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any particular station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish was not also in use at the district headquarters.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that Garda districts in the Galway West Division were approved by the Government for payment of the Gaeltacht allowance in 1934. Garda districts in the Donegal and Kerry Divisions were approved by the Government for payment of the Gaeltacht allowance in 1935. Since then, changes in those district boundaries would have had implications in the context of members qualifying for the Gaeltacht allowance. A full list of the districts concerned were supplied to the Deputy in my reply to Questions Nos. 900 to 906 of 3 October 2001.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's question about an examination carried out by the independent assessment group in respect of competency of gardaí to perform a service in Irish, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they do not have any information in this matter. If it is the case that the Deputy is seeking information on the examination normally carried out in relation to the allowance I will have inquiries made in this respect should the Deputy wish.</P>

      <P>It is envisaged that the Midleton-Cobh GYDP will have available to it one full-time youth worker employed by a youth organisation.

      <P>The project is funded under the national development plan 2000-2006, and I anticipate that adequate funding will be made available next year to ensure that this and all the other GYDPs continue their operations in 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The Special Olympics World Summer Games will be held in Ireland in June 2003 when Ireland will play host to an estimated 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and delegates along with 25,000 relatives and friends. This will be the first time the games will be held outside the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Games Organising Committee, GOC, <Col N="231" />under the chairmanship of Mr. Denis O'Brien, has overall responsibility for the planning, organising and financing of the games. The GOC has formed a number of sub-committees to address specific tasks and functions associated with delivering a successful games.</P>
    <P>The cost of staging what will be the largest sporting event anywhere in the world in 2003 will be £24 million, &euro;30.47 million, with a further IR£8 million, &euro;10.15 million, in in-kind support anticipated. The Government has approved the provision of up to £8 million, &euro;10.15 million, in grant support towards the total cost of the Games, the EU has committed IR£5 million, &euro;6.34 million, sponsorship commitments represent IR£12 million, &euro;15.23 million, and the remaining IR£7 million, &euro;8.88 million, will be raised through a variety of fundraising and marketing initiatives.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of sporting facilities and accommodation, the GOC inform me that they are making good progress. Twenty-one venues will be needed for the games and all the venues, which are in the general Dublin region, have been confirmed. The organisers intend to use the Aquatic and Leisure Centre at Abbotstown, as the location for the water based events which Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited plan to have ready for the games in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Games Organising Committee will shortly be providing information about a number of programmes associated with the games, such as the host town programme, the volunteers programme and other programmes in which communities countrywide may participate. On Sunday, 18 November, an event will take place in the RDS to announce the towns, villages and cities who will host the 160 teams through the host town programme.</P>

      <P>The culture, recreation and sports measure of the south and east regional operational programme &ndash; local infrastructure sub-programme &ndash; will support the balanced regional development and social inclusion priorities of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The specific objectives of the initiative as outlined in the programme complement are to promote and facilitate the pursuit of healthy, productive leisure activities and lifestyles, to address critical gaps identified in relation to the quality and supply of sporting and recreational infrastructure, and to enhance quality of life and support local development especially through the creation of a strong sense of local identity and community involvement in leisure activities.</P>
      <P>The commencement of this sub-measure is dependent on the completion of the national spatial strategy. The intention is that these facilities will be located so as to meet the needs of population centres which are spatially well dispersed and in which significant growth is expected in the medium term. A national spatial strategy will be submitted to Government shortly by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Once the hub areas have been identified I will begin the process of consultation with local authorities and voluntary groups aimed at putting an appropriate sports and recreational facilities investment programme in place.</P>

      <P>The social inclusion measures of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan, provided for in the vote of my Department are administered through Area Development <Col N="234" />Management Limited &ndash; ADM &ndash; and the local drugs task forces.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of October, an amount of £30 million approximately has been transferred to ADM for expenditure on these measures. The funding is expended by ADM to resource the activities of 38 area partnership companies and 33 community groups in areas that have been designated as disadvantaged. The funds are allocated on the basis of detailed action plans prepared by the partnerships and community groups, which concentrate on three key action areas &ndash; services to the unemployed, community development and community based youth initiatives.</P>
      <P>Since January 2001, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion has approved funding for the updated action plans of 12 of the 14 local drugs task forces. This funding has been allocated to task force projects covering a wide variety of initiatives in the areas of treatment, rehabilitation, prevention and awareness. In addition, over £5 million has been approved for 26 projects under the premises initiative for task force areas to meet their accommodation needs.</P>

      <P>The recreation element of my Department's work is addressed in a variety of ways mainly through various sports related programmes under which an integrated approach to policy development and implementation means that facilities, opportunities and supports for recreational, socialisation and leisure activities are delivered in different ways, incorporating the sport and local development areas of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department provides funding towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The main aims and objectives of the programme are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities, assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation and prioritise the needs of <Col N="235" />disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. The local authority swimming pool programme provides substantial funding towards the provision of these facilities, which provide the opportunity for people of all ages to take part in healthy, enjoyable activity and recreation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the young people's facilities and services funds assists in the development of preventative strategies and initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the Irish Sports Council supports a number of organisations and projects aimed at providing opportunities and at increasing participation among people of all ages in recreational and fun sport throughout the country.</P>

    <P>Average of arriving/departing overseas visitors including same-day visits. Europe includes Britain. (Source: CSO Country of Residence Survey).</P>
    <P>However, all figures for the number of people travelling by individual carriers, including Aer Lingus, to Ireland for the periods in question are provided to Bord Fáilte on a strictly confidential basis and for commercial reasons it is not possible for Bord Fáilte to release them.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the critical role that air carriers, including Aer Lingus, play in driving tourism growth and of the importance of encouraging the widest possible range of reliable, regular and commercial air services for Irish tourism. The Government has been working closely with the Irish aviation sector to help resolve recent difficulties and to help preserve the greatest number of international gateways. The Government moved quickly, in the wake of the September 11 crisis, to help resolve insurance difficulties which could have grounded aircraft and a high level group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and including representatives of my Department, is currently looking at the interaction between access transport, particularly by air, and tourism with a view to identifying possibilities for increasing the flow of visitors to Ireland. My Department has also been keeping in close touch with the Department of Public Enterprise on air access issues generally. In this context I welcome the recent decisions by Aer Rianta to extend their discount scheme for new routes to Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. Under this scheme there will be zero charges at Dublin for new routes for three years, and for four years at the other two airports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" />The Government continues to review developments in Aer Lingus and is deeply concerned at the difficulties it faces at this time. I and my colleagues in Government are very much aware of the key role played by Aer Lingus in relation to air access, particularly on the vitally important North American routes, and of the enormous contribution it has made as a service provider, and as an engine for the economic growth and development of Ireland and to Irish society generally. I am confident that every effort will be made to ensure that the vital role that Aer Lingus plays both with respect to tourism and generally, is given full recognition as the measures necessary to ensuring the continuing viability of the company in the longer term are developed and put in place.</P>

The Ireland-Wales INTERREG III operational programme, 2000-2006, was agreed between officials of that Department and their Welsh colleagues and deemed admissible by the Commission earlier this year. Discussions are currently taking place between both authorities on the content of the programme complement. Following agreement on the programme complement and the final approval of the Commission, it is hoped to launch details of the Ireland-Wales INTERREG III operational programme early next year.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry continues to be of increasing importance to the economy of both Ireland and Wales. This is recognised by the inclusion of a dedicated measure on tourism, heritage and culture, and will be used to generate additional economic benefits for the whole INTERREG region. The measure aims to financially support joint advertising, promotion and marketing strategies aimed at stimulating growth in visitor traffic to the maritime border region from both domestic and international markets. It will also support the development of joint heritage and tourism projects and the promotion of Welsh and Irish language initiatives, including those related to the arts. Any further enquiries should be directed to the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235, 237, 238, 242 and 244 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hugely increased investment in sport by the Government resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. Under the sports capital programme <Col N="240" />administered by my Department, funding is provided for indoor and outdoor facilities, local community projects and major regional and national sporting facilities. Grants under the programme totalling more than £106 million &euro;135million have been allocated to 2,044 projects in villages, parishes, towns and cities throughout Ireland since this Government took office. This funding represents a substantial increase over the amount of less than £19.4 million &euro;24.6million provided under the programme by the previous Government over the three years 1995 to 1997. In 2001 alone, more than £44.2 million or about &euro;56.2 million was allocated to 703 projects, representing an increase in funding of 640% on the allocation of less than £6 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed on an individual basis by officials in the sports division of my Department in accordance with the detailed assessment criteria specified in the programme's guidelines, terms and conditions, which are available on hard copy and on the Department's website at www.tourism-sport.irlgov.ie.</P>
    <P>The assessment process must take into account existing levels of facilities in an area, the strategic positioning of major facilities which may be required, and the quality of applications received for such projects. Each year a number of major regional and national projects are allocated funding, following consultations with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and the relevant national governing bodies of sport and local authorities, as applicable, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the 2001 sports capital programme, a total of over £1.7 million &euro;2.2 million was allocated to 18 athletics projects. This funding ranged from the provision of basic equipment for athletics clubs to the provision of major regional athletics facilities such as at Sligo IT £500,000 or &euro;634,869, Crusaders AC in Ringsend £250,000 or &euro;317,435 and £750,000 or &euro;952,304 altogether in the last two years, Dundrum, south Dublin, <Col N="241" />£200,000 or &euro;253,948 and An Ríocht in Castleisland £250,000 or &euro;317,435 in 2001 and a total of £615,000 or &euro;780,889 to this project since 1999. These grants increase the number and quality of regional athletics facilities which I have funded in recent years, which also include NUI Galway, Finn Valley in Donegal, Tullamore Harriers and Claremont Stadium in Navan.</P>
    <P>In addition to projects specifically classified as athletics, a further £14 million &euro;17.8 million was allocated in 2001 to 160 projects which were classified as community or mixed sport, many of which would provide some athletics facilities. In 2000, I also provided funding of £4.8 million &euro;6.1 million under the sports capital programme for the provision of the national indoor athletics centre and headquarters for the Athletics Association of Ireland at Morton Stadium in Santry. I propose to announce details of the 2002 sports capital programme within the next few weeks and it will then be open to all sporting and community organisations to make application for funding for their projects at that time.</P>
    <P>The local authority swimming pool programme is also administered by my Department and provides a sum of £45 million for the period 2000-2002 under an increase in the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million per annum over these years. Under the programme, grants of up to £3 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's overall sports policy, my Department committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick, which is expected to be completed soon. A total of £4.9 million &euro;6.2 million was provided for this item in my Department's Estimates for 2001.</P>
    <P>An amount of £85 million has been earmarked for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan 2000-2006. The facilities will be located at locations to be identified in the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>I understand from Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, the company established to drive the development of Sports Campus Ireland, that the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown, which is required to be completed for the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003 is currently being built on target.</P>
    <P>My Department's estimates for 2002, when they are finalised, will reflect the estimated level of funding for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities required next year. The massive and ongoing investment in sport provided by this Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres, and enables me to continue the work of providing a network of high quality, appropriate and sustainable sport and recreation facilities countrywide.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which moneys allocated from the proceeds of the national lottery or other sources to various sporting and recreational bodies here have been drawn down as at 31 October 2001; if some such approvals are unlikely to be drawn down in the short-term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants funded from the proceeds of the national lottery are allocated on an annual basis. The 416 organisations, which were allocated grants under the 1999 sports capital programme had until 30 September 2000, to confirm that work was under way and submit the necessary documentation to the Department so that the grants could be paid out. A substantial number of these projects have been completed while a small number are still in the course of construction. My Department has been in contact with the organisations whose projects have not yet commenced or who have not yet submitted any of the required documentation and has advised them that the grants are being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>In the case of allocations under the 2000 sports capital programme, the 679 organisations, which were grant aided, had until 28 September 2001, to submit the necessary documentation and evidence that construction work had begun on their project. The vast majority of the grantees submitted most of the necessary documentation by the due date and the processing of the documentation is ongoing in my Department. In the case of grantees which have not submitted the necessary documentation my Department is in the process of advising them that the grants are being withdrawn. It should be noted that an amount of 5% of each grant is retained pending the consultant's or architect's certificate that the project has been satisfactorily completed.</P>
      <P>During the course of the years 1999 and 2000, grants amounting to almost £1.3 million were withdrawn from 183 projects, which did not commence on time or which failed to submit the necessary documentation to my Department by the due dates. A total of £17 million has been drawn down so far this year under the programme.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, a total of 58 applications were received in 2001 in respect of projects in County Kildare. Following assessments of these applications, grants totalling £3,035,000 were allocated to 38 projects. The 2001 programme has now been completed and consequently there are no other requests from Kildare currently on hand under the sports capital programme. The 2002 programme will be advertised within the next few weeks and applications for funding will be invited at that time.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. In order of progression, these are: preliminary report; contract document; tender and construction. The Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project, unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grants are not allocated until such time as tenders for a project have been received. Two proposals were submitted by Kildare County Council prior to the programme's closing date of 31 July 2000 in respect of replacement of the pools in Naas and Athy. Preliminary reports for these proposals are at present being assessed by Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 to 247, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs-organisations have to be made on an individual basis. All applications received are assessed in accordance with a detailed set of criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
      <P>Through these criteria, every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories, having regard to the existing range of facilities in each county while also affording priority to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people.</P>
      <P>Where appropriate, my Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and with local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. A list of the grants allocated to the towns in question since 1999 follows. I am satisfied the assessment criteria now being used to take account of the amenity and recreational needs of all parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The 2002 programme will be advertised within the next few weeks and it will be open to organisations from the areas referred to in County Kildare to make applications for funding at that time.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to encourage the implementation of environmental measures in hotels and other establishments providing holiday accommodation. In 1997, I launched a special pilot tourism and the environment initiative because of the importance to our tourism industry of promoting good environmental practice.</P>
      <P>One project, promoted by the Institute of Technology in Tralee, assessed the impact of hotels and guesthouses on the environment with a view to developing best practice models. When this project was completed last year, I was very happy to launch A Natural Shade of Green &ndash; An Environmental Guide for Hotels. The guide addresses issues such as, energy efficiency, waste elimination and reduction, reducing water usage, minimising effluents and developing an environmental purchasing policy. A similar guide has been issued for use by guesthouses.</P>
      <P>I believe that these guide books, if used by hotels and other establishments, have the capacity to serve as blueprints for the wider implementation of environmental best practice for accommodation providers throughout the tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides grants to organisations for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. Among the objectives of the programme are: to assist volun<Col N="246" />tary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. Voluntary and community organisations can apply for assistance under the programme. Projects must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities.</P>
      <P>In 2001, I allocated a total of over £44.2 million &ndash;&euro;56.2 million &ndash; through the sports capital programme to 703 projects around the country, of which over £14m &ndash;&euro;17.9 million was allocated to 160 projects which were classified as community or mixed sport. In all, since this Government took office I have allocated over £106m &ndash;&euro;135 million to 2,044 projects, compared with a total of less than £19.4m &ndash;&euro;24.6 million by the previous Government through 1995-1997.</P>
      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund  &ndash; YPFSF &ndash; was established in 1998, in the context of the Government's national drugs strategy, to assist in the development of preventative strategies and initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the YPFSF is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund is 10-21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and-or drugs etc.</P>
      <P>An Exchequer contribution of over £26 million &ndash;&euro;33 million &ndash; has been allocated to date for the provision of youth orientated facilities. The type of projects and initiatives approved as part of the plans and strategies submitted to date include: capital projects such as building, renovating or fitting out community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs so as to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in an area. Access for the target group is an essential condition of funding for capital projects. A number of purpose-built youth centres which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly those areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, where there is a dearth of dedicated youth facilities.</P>
      <P>Through the schemes outlined above, the funding allocated towards the provision of sport and recreational sport facilities at a community level is unprecedented.</P>

The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million (&euro;470.4 million). This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>

      <P>At present, the courses run in the State which allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the Bachelor of Education degree and the 18 month postgraduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education which specialise in the training of primary teachers. In the 2000-01 <Col N="251" />academic year 3,300 students were enrolled and pursuing various stages of these programmes.</P>
      <P>The 18 month course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers. The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then. My Department is currently in consultation with the colleges of education about arrangements for another course. The timing and details will be announced when the consultation process is complete. There are currently no plans to provide a postgraduate diploma course in primary teaching in University College Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>French and German have traditionally been the most common foreign languages taught in schools in Ireland. At present 98% of post primary schools offer French and 65% offer German. I recognise, however, that there is a need to encourage pupils to take up other languages and to increase the range of languages available in schools.</P>
      <P>Last year I established the post primary languages initiative with a view to diversifying, enhancing and expanding the teaching of languages in second level schools. This is a follow on to the successful modern languages, primary project which has been in operation since 1998 and which is currently operating in a number of primary schools. French is currently being taught at fifth and sixth class levels in 171 primary schools, German in 76, Spanish in 58 and Italian in 19 schools. A national co-ordinator directs the initiative and a team of project leaders is in place to assist and provide support to the schools participating in the project.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot scheme is being conducted by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, ITÉ, and I look forward to receiving the evaluation report in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major difficulty in relation to the teaching of modern continental languages at primary level has been the availability of appropriately trained teachers. I had asked officials of my Department to discuss this issue with some of the institutes of technology. A group of the institutes of tecnhology has now put in place 11 graduate diploma courses in German, ten graduate diploma courses in French and a number of certificate courses in Spanish and Italian. These courses are designed <Col N="254" />for qualified primary teachers and I understand that there is a very high level of interest in them.</P>
    <P>Under the post primary languages initiative, Italian, Japanese and Spanish were selected as the initial target languages: Spanish as it is one of the three most widely spoken languages in the world; Italian for its accessibility and the cultural and business opportunities which it affords; and Japanese as a gateway to Asian language, culture and business.</P>
    <P>To date, approximately 160 schools have responded to the invitation to participate in the initiative and have been given grants by my Department for the purchase of materials and as payment for supplementary teaching hours. Under the direction of a national coordinator, the initiative is also engaged in research on teaching materials, the planning and delivery of inservice training for teachers, including a newly developed course in the use of IT in language training, and the dissemination of information on the many opportunities for language development now available to teachers and pupils. I hope, in the course of the five-year life span of the Initiative, to see a significant increase in the proportion of schools offering more language options to pupils.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant-aid towards the cost of a building project at Scoil na Mainistreach, Celbridge, County Kildare. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, &euro;470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including Scoil na Mainstreach, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

      <P>The Schools IT 2000 initiative was designed to integrate modern information and communications technology into teaching and learning within the first and second level education systems. Over £40 million, &euro;52 million, has been spent on the programme to date from central funds and in addition a further £20 million, &euro;26 million, has been invested by public and private sector partners in the overall venture. The specific objectives of Schools IT 2000 were to put into place a permanent infrastructure to ensure that all students would have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to equip themselves for participation in the information society and to give support to teachers in developing and renewing professional skills to enable them to utilise ICTs as part of the learning environment of the school.</P>
      <P>These objectives were delivered through the following initiatives: technology integration initiative, TII, involving the grant aiding of ICT infrastructure at first and second level schools; teacher skills initiative, TSI, involving a comprehensive training scheme providing ICT training for all teachers at first and second level education; and school integration projects, SIP, involving a number of school based projects determining the efficacy of information and communication technologies, ICTs, in the classroom. The focus of these innovative projects is to examine a range of ICT strategies and methodologies relevant to the broad spectrum of educational practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that Schools IT 2000 has achieved the following: the pupil-computer ratios are 17.7:1 for primary and 13:1 for post-primary schools, up from 35:1 and 16:1, respectively, in 1998; every school now has a connection to the Internet, up from 25% in 1998. Some 62% of second level schools now have multi-users web <Col N="259" />access, mainly <i>via</i> ISDN; 18% of primary schools and 78% of second level schools now have computer networks in place, an increase of 14% and 28%, respectively; 15% of primary schools and 46% of second level schools have websites, up from 3% and 22%, respectively and approximately 50,000 IT training places have been provided and 75% of all teachers have attended some ICT course since early 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, continues to provide teacher training and support to primary and post-primary schools. In addition, full-time ICT advisers have been appointed to each of the 20 full-time education centres around the country to provide advice and support to schools on ICT issues on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>As an integral component of Schools IT 2000, my Department also arranged for the establishment of the National Policy Advisory and Development Committee, NPADC, as an independent advisory body representative of the partners in education and the social partners, with a view to ensuring that future policy formulation on integrating ICTs into education could be informed by expertise from within the teaching profession and other interested bodies. The NPADC commissioned a study of the impact of aspects of Schools IT 2000, the results of which were considered by them at its September meeting.</P>
    <P>I understand that a report, which incorporates these results together with the NPADC's recommendations, is to be presented to me shortly. The report will inform the policy framework within which the £85 million I have allocated for a new three year programme of integration of ICT into Irish schools will be spent. Grants amounting to up to £21.75 million, &euro;27.6 million, will be paid to schools before the end of this year as the first instalment to schools under the new programme.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly which exists whereby social welfare recipients who do not live at home and who are not 23 years of age are disqualified from receiving third level grants due to the fact that they are assessed with their parents' income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The higher education grants schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the first day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
