      <P>I was speaking about the remarkable achievement in this budget in view of the fact that there has been a general downturn in the economy. There was the foot and mouth disease crisis where fortunately we in Ireland escaped with one outbreak and of course there was the 11 September disasters in the United States. I am particularly heartened by the summary of the economic outlook for 2002, with economic growth forecast at 3.9%, employment again to increase by 1.5% annually to 2004, inflation set to fall from 4.2% to 2.25% by 2004, an Exchequer surplus and general Government surplus in 2002 and at the same time an increase in net current spending and net capital spending of 10.5% in 2002. By any yardstick these are very attractive figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I briefly referred to the social welfare increases which have been well documented at this stage. As I have always said in this House, the worth of a Government can be gauged by how it treats the older people in society and certainly over the past five years the Government has lived up to that expectation. This year's increase of £10 per week brings the old age pension to well in excess of £100, which was the target set by us in 1997, but when one adds to that all the other benefits being granted, the increase <Col N="294" /> in the fuel allowance and the extra electricity allowance, one will find that our pensions are among the better off pensions in the world. That is not to say that is the way it should be, but I get great satisfaction at my constituency clinics from meeting people who left this country many years ago and who find on their return that even with their full contributory pensions from England, they can still avail of a reduced rate non-contributory pension with all the additional social welfare benefits which that entails. That is laudable and something about which we must be very happy.</P>
    <P>On the taxation side, I am delighted again that the lower paid in particular have benefited in this budget and I compliment the Minister on that. He has continued what he set out to do four years ago, against the current economic climate. As I said yesterday evening, when one remembers that not many years ago the higher rate of tax was 65%, with a surcharge, and the lower rate was well in excess of 30%, that achievement speaks for itself. I am delighted a contribution has been made to the national pensions fund to provide for future generations and that is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Obviously in every budget there is a downside and I must refer to the increase in the excise duties on petrol and diesel and the effect they will have on the transport industry. During the course of this year, because of the downturn in the economy, the events of 11 September and the foot and mouth disease crisis, the tourism sector in particular has suffered. I welcome the additional funding which has been provided for that sector. Nevertheless, I want to raise one specific matter on behalf of the Coach Tourism Council of Ireland, which has been in touch with the Minister's office for some time looking for a rebate on excise duty on fuel for operators engaged in coach tourism. The operators have suffered huge losses and are under severe pressure. They are also at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to the State-sponsored company. They are hit by the increase in the price of diesel of 5p per litre, the increase in VAT and the high excise duty rate for high-sulphur diesel, which has been increased by 6% per litre more than low-sulphur diesel.</P>
    <P>Low-sulphur diesel cannot be got in Ireland. It has been tried at Whitegate, but it would mean that all the pumps at service outlets would have to be changed and that would have serious consequences for this sector, which is on its knees at present. Therefore, I want to emphasise that a rebate on excise duties on fuel should be granted to this sector in the Finance Bill. The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to look favourably at that and I hope he will do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the health strategy announced by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, last week. Obviously there is a great debate about the extension of medical cards to those most in need and I certainly support that call. I appreciate that there are many demands on the funding available to the Minister but nevertheless I ask that he seriously consider extending the entitlement to medical cards, in particular to <Col N="295" /> children under a certain age. I look forward to a favourable response on that in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to welcome this budget. The Minister has got the balance right. His five budgets have been good. He is a man who has his finger on the pulse. He knows what is happening out there and I think he has got it right on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Aylward for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this excellent budget, the Government's fifth, which is a unique record. Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Finance, is to be congratulated as it allows for politically astute measures, including an historically large increase in spending on health, significant increases in child benefit, social welfare payments, pensions and spending on roads as well as modest tax cuts to benefit the lower paid. The budget manages to fund the proper measures by avoiding the need to borrow while enabling the Minister to achieve the remarkable feat of raising capital and current spending by 10.5%, cutting tax in an economic turndown and still running a budget surplus.</P>
      <P>The Opposition denounced the source of the extra money but the Minister pointed out that these funds were owned by the State and that his plans to take money from the social insurance fund and the Central Bank would be underpinned by legislation in the Social Welfare Bill. Future Ministers can do the same if they so chose.</P>
      <P>The increase of 125 million for health on top of the Estimates of two weeks ago represents the largest ever raise and may prove to be a shrewd move. The increase in child benefit of £25 per month for the first and second child to £92.62 and by £30 per month for the third and subsequent children to £116 is welcome. The Minister has also fulfilled his commitment to put 1% of GNP into the national reserve pension fund.</P>
      <P>Changes in tax payments will take a further 68,000 people out of the tax net. Those earning up to 90% of the minimum wage will now pay no tax and the Government's aim is to remove all on the minimum wage. Widening the standard rate tax band will remove 57,000 from the higher rate although the rates of 20% and 42% remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The old age pension goes up by £10 per week bringing it to £105 for non-contributory and £116 for contributory pensions. All other full rate social welfare recipients will get £8 while £9.50 goes to those who receive the lowest payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Married couples earning two incomes will fare better than single income families. A married couple with one spouse working will be able to earn £29,140 after their basic tax credit and still pay income tax at the standard rate. A married couple with both partners working can earn £44,104 and still remain on the 20% tax rate. This <Col N="296" /> is a difference in taxation of £3,982 for a couple where one spouse stays at home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the over 8 million boost for the tourism industry, on top of what was announced in the Estimates, as it embarks on a major international marketing drive. It will go to various sectors, with £5 million going to the regional tourism bodies to develop festivals and cultural events, for example. I welcome the once off contribution of 320,000 to the Rose of Tralee Festival. This festival had serious financial problems and could have been forced out of business which would have been a major loss to Tralee, Kerry and Ireland as it had always made a major contribution to promoting tourism. Tourism Ireland Ltd., the new all Ireland market organisation, receives 2.76 million, while 1 million goes to the national sports tourism initiative bringing it up to 5.67 million annually until 2007.</P>
    <P>The Government is making a major effort to encourage people to buy houses and apartments to rent out. This is designed to help the house building industry and to ease the rental accommodation crisis. From 1 January, purchasers of apartments and houses for rent will be able to offset mortgage payments against rental income. In addition, the 9% stamp duty on second-hand properties was abolished. This was a major stumbling block in the past two years and reduced the sale of second-hand houses to a trickle. Up to now, anyone who invested in a £200,000 second-hand house or flat to rent out was faced with a stamp duty bill of £18,000, but now investors will play the same sliding scale of duty as owner occupiers with the 9% applying only to properties costing in excess of £500,000.</P>
    <P>This budget is caring and equitable, in keeping with our radical social philosophy. As a country we have made magnificent progress over the past four years as is recognised everywhere. Our early budgets were central to boosting confidence and prolonging the prosperity as long as international circumstances allowed. An unprecedented period of high growth allowed us to catch up on our European partners. We exploited our opportunities to the full to do the maximum for social inclusion in other ways as well, and the emphasis of this budget is directed towards the least well off and improving public services.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the Opposition claimed that there was a cutback in the funding for school building projects but the facts show that this misrepresents the truth. The January 1997 budget allocated 74 million to all school building projects while this budget allocates 335 million. The impact of funding can be seen throughout the country. In 1997, there were only 22 large scale school building projects under way. Today, there are 200.</P>
    <P>We must continue to attach great importance to jobs. The reduction of employer's PRSI to 10.5% is a major boost to competitiveness that largely compensates for the removal of the ceiling. I could talk much more on this excellent budget but time does not permit me to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the civil servants in the Department of Finance for the manner in which they presented the budget. It has been improving over the years but on this occasion not only were the Minister's speech and the details of the budget available but also the Financial Resolutions. More importantly, by their including the multi-annual budgets, we can see clearly what the trends will be. That is a major step forward in transparency and accountability, because, regardless of what spin a Government puts on a budget on the day, it is clear from the figures provided where we will go next year and the year after. I thank the officials of the Department for doing a fine job in presenting the budget and the supporting documents.</P>
      <P>On budget day, the most disappointed man in the House was the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I am not surprised at that. In a way I was disappointed for him. I remember in the early 1980s that the day after a budget he used to go after the Haughey administration in particular and lecture them on sound finances, for not putting the full picture to the people, on voodoo economics and trick in the loop financial measures. I understand why he was disappointed when he delivered his budget because he was forced by the Government into the position that he had deplored all his life. That is a great tragedy for a man who had a view of how the country's finances should be run. Many of us on this side of the House, who have a high personal regard for the Minister, shared his grief.</P>
      <P>However, we must deal with the budget as it was presented to us. On budget day there was a tragedy of enormous proportions. The Minister for Finance all his life built a reputation on sound finances and came into office pledged to control public finances and not to increase public expenditure by more than 4% in any year above the outturn of the previous year. We must judge his performance, first, on what has happened to the public finances and then the manner in which he tried to disguise what was happening, despite the officials' great work.</P>
      <P>I deal with that first because there was an appalling raid on the social insurance fund when almost 600 million was taken from its surplus. That fund is the accumulated payments of the ordinary workers of this country who pay pay related social insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their employers also put in an amount. This is done under law and the fund is there for a specific purpose. The Minister, when he introduced the 1% of GNP payment into the other fund for public servants' pensions, said in this House &ndash; anyone can check the record &ndash; that he intended to put the social insurance fund beyond the reach of politicians as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He felt this was a pension fund which had the <Col N="298" /> same integrity as a private pension fund and that he would like if this was part of the setting aside for the rainy day in the future, to ensure that social insurance pensions of all sorts could be paid. It is an appalling reversal of policy that he was forced into a position where he had to raid the social insurance fund, but raid it he did and he raided it in a most appalling way.</P>
    <P>I was looking at the <i>Financial Times </i>this morning and one of its main financial stories this morning is that the government of Argentina &ndash; whose finances are in an appalling state at the moment &ndash; has expropriated funds from private pension funds. A spokesman for its government said that any strategy it has taken recently to preserve the integrity of its finances has lasted no more than a day. The IMF in Washington said that while what the Argentinian government was doing was appalling the IMF felt that in the particular circumstances it was justified; it was either that or a devaluation of the peso and financial ruin in Argentina.</P>
    <P>After five years of the most prosperous growth ever, we have our Minister for Finance raiding a pension fund into which workers have paid their contributions. The two administrations that have raided pension funds this week are the administration in Argentina and the administration in Ireland. What does that do for our international credibility? It is justified in Argentina because of the appalling financial crisis. It was done here for expediency, for political purposes to hide the Minister's blushes, to pretend we were not sliding into deficit when we are sliding into deficit. In the best tradition of Mr. Haughey it is to ready-up the financial figures for political purposes. That is a great tragedy for this administration and it also affects our national credibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also announced that he will force the Central Bank to pay over money. I refer to the business supplement in <i>the Irish Times</i>. Spokespersons on behalf of the Central Bank are objecting very strongly to this. They say it is not within the legal remit of the Minister to do this, that it is an interference with the independence of the Central Bank. They say that they will be forced to work on an Estimate if the Minister forces the Central Bank to pay over this money. They will not know the true picture of the funds at their disposal for another three years. They will not be in a position to state accurately within one month after the introduction of the euro what the additional savings to the Central Bank are from the non-return of punt notes and coins in circulation.</P>
    <P>This is another off the top of the head initiative from the Minister. It is the kind of thing he deplored all his life, the kind of thing Mr. Haughey would regard as a wonderful financial wheeze. Without the consent of the Central Bank he announced in the House that he will take a set amount of money when the Central Bank does not even know what amount of money will accrue to it as a result of the changeover to the euro.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also bringing forward payment <Col N="299" /> dates for corporation profits tax. This is very interesting. I heard the Tánaiste yesterday attacking the Labour Party for the suggestion by Deputy McDowell that in certain circumstances the tax base would have to be looked at in a deteriorating financial situation. The Minister's proposals for corporation profits tax will have exactly the same effect over the next five years as increasing the rate from 12.5% to 15%. I heard the Tánaiste lecturing Deputy McDowell yesterday by saying that his proposal would close down the country and there would be no inward investment if there was a move from 12.5%, yet the Minister for Finance had announced a measure which takes it from 12.5% to 15% for the next five years. I wonder if we are back again to the days of individualisation when even senior Ministers like the Tánaiste have no idea really of the consequences of the measures announced on budget day. If we choose to follow the Argentinian road by raiding the Central Bank then we are back again to the days of GUBU and the days of Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>These are the actions taken by the Minister to avoid the political blushes. If we sweep aside the thin disguise and look at what is actually happening to the public finances, an appalling picture emerges. When this Government came to office in 1997 it inherited a fiscal situation where the budget at the end of 1997 &ndash; Deputy Quinn's last budget &ndash; was in surplus. That was the first surplus recorded for years and years. One would have to go back to the founding of the State to find a surplus. That was the Minister's opening position. He says he wants to be judged over five budgets, so let us judge him now. He has disguised the fact that we are sliding into deficit this year, but because of the good work and the transparency, accountability, honesty and professionalism of the civil servants in the Department of Finance, anybody can look at the tables and see what the trend is. The projection on a no-change policy is that we will have a deficit of just under 3 billion in 2003. The deficit in 2004 will be 3.7 billion. That is an appalling situation when one thinks of where we have come from since 1997 in fiscal terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell has provided me with a graphic but we do not have the electronic capability in the House to show it on screen. It shows that from 2001 to 2004 a projection on the figures provided by the Department of Finance, the deterioration in the public finances over that period will be a decrease or a disimprovement in the Exchequer position of 8.1 billion. We should think about that. Twelve months ago in this House the Minister projected a surplus and the opening position in 2004 shows a deterioration in excess of 8 billion. That is the legacy that this administration is leaving to its successors. That is an appalling indictment of this administration. It is an appalling indictment of this Minister and an appalling indictment of the Taoiseach. He is more responsible than anybody else for this budget. If <Col N="300" /> one took this budget to the forensic experts in Garda Headquarters to be examined electronically for fingerprints and hidden signs and codes, it would show all the fingerprints of the Taoiseach and very few of the fingerprints of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The problems would not be that appalling if we had something to show for the past five years. If we look at the record of the past five years we see that the problems faced by the Irish people are quite difficult. We have the appalling mismanagement to which I referred. We have gone from a situation where the Minister for Finance pledged that he would maintain public expenditure to increases of not more than 4% year on year and yet this year on the projected outturn, public expenditure has increased by 23%. How can one pledge 4% and end up with 23%?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not a sudden deterioration in 12 months. The previous year's out turn showed 17% as against the 4% promised. We have this appalling mess created by this administration. We know that economic forecasting is not an exact science and events this year have confirmed this. However, there is an enormous difference between economic forecasting and actually managing an economy. The Government may argue that it has been unlucky with its economic forecasting but we cannot talk about luck when it comes to managing an economy; that is entirely a question of competence. Any manager worth his salt will say a manager should always manage for both the good days and the bad days. In particular good managers manage for the unexpected. This administration, in so far as it has any managerial competence, has merely managed to surf on top of the wave of prosperity. The longer it stayed on top of the wave of prosperity, it began to suffer from the delusion it had created the wave on which it rode.</P>
      <P>It is vital to manage the economy against the background of a long-term vision of the country. Day-to-day management without long-term vision is nothing more than a gamble. When gambling, there are times when one hits and times when one misses resulting in being either ahead or behind. However, a Government cannot set out a list of achievable national objectives by simply extemporising, making it up as it goes along and hoping it stays out of political difficulty. That is what this Government has done.</P>
      <P>With the national finances facing meltdown once more, when all economic signs are pointing us right back to the 1980s with big deficits again and very strong commitments to borrowing, we have little to show for the years of prosperity in terms of public services or the quality of life enjoyed by the people. This is a result of the hit and miss approach indulged in on a day-to-day basis by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance supported by the <Col N="301" /> Cabinet wants to be judged on five budgets so let us look at the record. The Government pledged to keep public spending growth within a limit of 4% per year. It has totally failed to do so. Public expenditure in 2001 has increased by 23%. That is not a Fine Gael figure, but is the figure provided by the officials in the Department of Finance with which the Minister for Finance agrees.</P>
    <P>This Government inherited a low inflation economy. It failed utterly to keep it that way and, due entirely to misconceived Government action in fuelling the fires of an economy that was already blazing particularly in its last budget, it drove Ireland from the bottom of the inflationary league table to the very top. In the words of Sean Healy, it ruled a country that had the prosperity but lacked the fairness. The fundamental divide between the rich and the poor is wider as it leaves office than when it came in.</P>
    <P>When it comes to completing projects on time this Government has also been an appalling failure. We all know about the Luas light rail system in Dublin. It should have been operational by now if the Government had gone ahead with the proposals it inherited when it came into office in 1997. However it procrastinated, held reviews, carried out revisions, fooled around, held press conferences, hired PR firms, brought out the spin doctors and then in a gesture reminiscent of the Congo Republic in its darkest days, the Taoiseach had a photo call in an empty carriage in Merrion Square poised on railway lines coming from nowhere and going nowhere. If there was ever a metaphor to describe this Government, that is it. It is on lines coming from nowhere and going nowhere and in an appalling mess.</P>
    <P>The national plan was announced with great expenditure of taxpayers' money on the gurus, spin doctors and PR firms. However it had barely started when it was running way behind. It is now two years behind schedule and 150% over budget. If this were the private sector, they would all be sacked. They would not get as far as the annual general meeting. They would be out the door in jig time as soon as the figures became apparent. With the voodoo economics, the funny financing and the trick of the loop transfers of money, in which the Minister engaged on budget day, if he were the financial controller of any private firm in this country, he would have seen the shares drop very significantly the following day and he would be out the door by breakfast time on Sunday. The Minister is a great advocate of private sector discipline. If he had done this in the private sector he would have been fired in jig time.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the appalling carnage on our roads, which has visited almost every family in the country particularly affecting young people. Five years ago, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, brought in a five-year plan for road safety on our roads. The key basis for this was an amendment to the Road Traffic Act. We waited until two weeks ago to get the amendment before the House and then it was accompanied by an <Col N="302" /> announcement the Minister would not be able to implement the measures he had proposed for another two years. Five years of procrastination on a road safety strategy from a Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who talked a great game but unfortunately never put a ball in the net for any area of policy in five years.</P>
    <P>If we consider our readiness for an information society, again there was all the talk. There was the link with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We were going to revitalise the James's Street area of Dublin and we were going to take the lead as the information economy. On the list of OECD countries we are third from the bottom. We are falling behind our competitors. Digital television is late. The roll-out of broadband internet access has not taken place in some parts of the country and is exorbitantly expensive in others. We have not yet issued licences for third generation mobile telephones and we are the only country in the European Union that has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>As I go around the country there is a growing realisation among industrialists that the piece of infrastructure that will make three quarters of the country uncompetitive in the next two years is the lack of access to broadband internet. In my constituency and in that of Deputy Donal Carey and throughout the mid-west region, there is broadband access but at three times the price of what it costs in Dublin. We have been advised by the most senior industrialists and the biggest employers in the region that if this continues for another two years, they will be uncompetitive and will not be able to sustain operations at the current level. This is true all along the west coast and throughout Munster and in the midlands of Leinster. The only place where there is broadband access at competitive European rates is in the greater Dublin area. Any Government with any concept of a regional policy would want to take note of this.</P>
    <P>After five years of the most prosperous economy ever experienced, we have a legacy of incompetence in economic management among Ministers, who think their only role in life is to con the public by posing for pretty pictures and think there is no need to run their Departments. They are led by a Taoiseach, who, I understand, now only spends two days in his office. This country is no longer being run and is on automatic pilot.</P>
    <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act, we requested the list of the Taoiseach's appointments in St. Luke's in Drumcondra and at his office in Merrion Street. He is more often in St. Luke's in Drumcondra or elsewhere in the country. Last summer, when the Minister for Finance was trying to meet him to tell him about the deterioration in the public finances, he has to go on pilgrimage to St. Luke's in Drumcondra. When the Minister for Finance requested a meeting with the Taoiseach, he was told to turn up at his constituency clinic where he could be fitted in <Col N="303" /> between three people looking for medical cards and a woman looking for a house.</P>
    <P>This was at a point when the finances were deteriorating massively. The CSO knew that in the first quarter, growth had gone down from 11% to 1.8%. We now know that because the figures have been published. This became clear to the Minister for Finance in the second quarter of April, May and June. He also knew that expenditure was heading to more than 20% and revenue had dropped back to 2%. The result for the whole year is a 23% increase in expenditure and a 2% increase in revenue. It does not require an A in honours maths to know where that will lead.</P>
    <P>What was the reaction of our great Taoiseach? He said he would see the Minister in St. Luke's in Drumcondra and it would be all right because the lads that advise him in Drumcondra would fix it for him. That is appalling. Is it any wonder we have the lack of result I described? </P>
    <P> When the Government tries to do something, such as beating budgets, for example, it is also extremely incompetent. There was a £14 million project in Irish Rail &ndash; I do not know if we will get to the bottom of it &ndash; but the outturn was anywhere between £40 million and £70 million. Competent management is getting things done on budget. That is what competent managers do. These people cannot get things done and when they do, the budget is all over the place.</P>
    <P>The biggest charge one could lay against incompetent managers is that they have an alchemist capacity to turn success into failure. I was always impressed by the story of Midas when I was young. When he touched something, it turned to gold. I was enthusiastic about this as I thought it would be a great ability to have until my mother said the slice of bread I had in my hand might also turn into gold and that would be difficult. Whatever the Midas touch is, the Government has the opposite. Midas could turn dross into gold, but the Government has the capacity, as it has shown over five years, to turn gold into dross and has done so time after time.</P>
    <P>This message will not be lost on the half a million shareholders encouraged by the Government to invest in the success of Eircom. We had a successful telecommunications company which was in State ownership. The gurus were hired and the spin doctors brought on board. The advisers to whom between £80 million and £90 million was subsequently paid were briefed by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance to gear up the company for sale. We all know what happened and the grief visited on many small shareholders throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This was an appalling con job because the Government was not dealing with people sophisticated in the purchase of shares or who understood high finance, but with those who felt they had a patriotic duty to get involved and buy shares in the great enterprise when it was floated. Many old age pensioners used their savings to buy shares. Many borrowed money from the cre<Col N="304" /> dit union and bought shares because they were convinced by Government public relations that this was a way of sharing the success of Eircom with the people. The sales pitch was that it was the people's company and they were entitled to some of the profit. Some 450,000 Eircom shareholders have lost up to 40% of their investment. Many borrowed what they invested. That is a good example of turning success into failure, of the reverse of the Midas touch and of what Fianna Fáil will face from the people in the long grass who are waiting for election day to tell it what they think of the Administration.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus was a highly profitable company when Deputy Dukes was in charge and when he left office in 1997. It was showing extensive profits and there were inquiries from airline companies across Europe who wanted to buy into it. It was ready for further expansion and investment. However, look at it now. There were 6,000 employees in Aer Lingus, which is now in an appalling mess.</P>
    <P>What did the teachers and the nurses get from the five years of prosperity? They are moving out of their professions as there is a crisis of morale.</P>
    <P>As regards specific targets, the Government set out lower house prices, but the result is higher prices. It stated it would provide more child care places, but the result is fewer places at more expensive rates. It set out simple targets, such as to halt school truancy. However, the result is that it has increased. It set out to reduce crime, but there is more. It set out to ease traffic congestion, but the result is chaos. The first day of Operation Free Flow in the city was a mockery of everyone involved because everything ground to a halt. It set out to close Sellafield, but the result is it is expanding. There will also be a MOX plant, which will threaten the east coast, thanks to the great relationship between the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the Taoiseach. That relationship is bound in gold and will overcome all difficulties. It is an appalling record.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget for the taxpayer. There is 600 million in tax concessions and 580 million in tax take. The budget has broken trust with the Hauliers Association of Ireland, which blocked roads and bridges 12 months ago and stood down the protest on the basis that VAT on fuel would be reduced. However, it has been increased again. There has been an increase of 22p or 23p in the price of a gallon of petrol. The VAT increase of 1% from 1 March means that a further 2.5p or 3p will be added to the price.</P>

We see the lack of investment coming through the pipeline, particularly from the United States. In those circumstances, the Minister decided to change the arrangements for paying corporation profit tax. He has done so in a way <Col N="305" /> that, as well as paying the liability for this year next year, they will also have to pay a further 20%. It is exactly the same as if corporate profit tax was raised from 12.5% to 15% and this will last for the next five years. Does the Government think the decision-makers in the boardrooms of the United States have not seen this? Do they understand the Government's commitment not to raise the rate above 12.5% again is a flawed promise? </P>
      <P>It is an appalling record. The Government should not come back after Christmas. It should go to the country and let the people adjudicate now. As far as the Government is concerned, the show is over and it is time to give the public the opportunity to adjudicate on its appalling record.</P>

The second crisis for Fine Gael is that almost everybody in the country is working which means its market has been removed. Deputy Noonan is saying happy Christmas to everyone from Fine Gael which is here on the doom and gloom bench of the world. That has been the consistent Fine Gael message during the years. It does not have a vision or plan for the future and does not carry out an in-depth analysis of where we should go or what it might have to contribute to the development of the country. We know from its consistent stance that it does not have the capacity to deliver on either front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> Since coming into office on 26 June 1997 the Government has created an economic climate which has helped all aspects of our economy to flourish. It has achieved one of the best economic performances in the world in the last four years, a record which is the envy of many of our European partners. The economy has grown in GDP terms by an annual average of 10%. Our debt to GDP ratio stood at 74% in 1996, the last full year before we came into office, and will be about 36% at the end of 2001, the second lowest in Europe. More than 300,000 new jobs have been created and long-term unemployment is down from 5.6% to 1.2%. As a result, unemployment will have fallen from 10.3% in 1997 to an expected average of 4% this year.</P>
    <P>The Government has delivered on the economy and, through this budget and the previous four, on its promises. We promised to develop a quality health service. By 2002 we will have increased the gross Department of Health and Children allocation by over 4.5 billion, or 125%, since 1997. There are now more than 4,000 additional doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, a fact at odds with claims by the Labour Party and Fine Gael that all the extra jobs were created in administration. There are 90,000 more hospital treatments being carried out.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that more needs to be done and it is for this reason that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, launched the Government's health strategy last week. This is a comprehensive strategy, which will put in place a world class health service. Over the next ten years we are delivering on our commitment to develop a quality health service and I am very pleased at the reaction of most of those involved in its delivery. They have warmly welcomed the vision and quality of the health strategy that has been produced.</P>
    <P>We were taunted at the start of our term in office with regard to our commitment to increase old age pensions to over £100 per week. We have exceeded that and made a major investment in education. Class sizes are at their lowest levels, almost in living memory. There are 20,000 extra places at third level, enabling far more of our children to prepare themselves for success in a modernised economy. We have delivered on all our educational commitments.</P>
    <P>A key part of the Government's programme was to reduce personal tax and encourage people to take up work. Over our five budgets more than 4.8 billion in tax reductions has been delivered. The standard rate of tax has been cut from 26% to 20% and the higher rate from 48% to 42%. We should remind ourselves that during the rainbow Government's term in office one penny was the entire amount given back to the taxpayer. The initial entry point to taxation has been more than doubled, to £165 from £77. These changes delivered substantial increases in real disposable income for everyone and the introduction of tax credits has made the income tax system more equitable. After this budget 690,000 income ear<Col N="307" /> ners, or 37% of all those on the records of the Revenue Commissioners, will be outside the tax net. The corresponding figures when we took office were 380,000 or 26%.</P>
    <P>On the issue of taxation, it is important to dwell for a moment on the facts often forgotten by those who criticise the Government. Of the 4.8 billion in tax reductions in these five budgets, 43% has gone on increasing basic tax allowances, or credits as they are now known, including the PAYE allowance. A further 22% went to take over 370,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax, over 16% to reduce the standard rate of tax paid by all taxpayers and just 11% to cut the top rate of income tax. These are the facts. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms and tax reductions which the Government has carried out. It has been a Government for all taxpayers, a fact some would like to deny.</P>
    <P>Before looking in a little more detail at what the Government's fifth budget has done, it is important to dwell for a moment on current economic conditions. To say the Government had to introduce its fifth budget in uncertain times may be considered an understatement. Clearly, the horrific events in the United States of America, which we all witnessed on our television screens in September, and the ensuing conflict in Afghanistan have exacerbated the already difficult economic situation. These events, added to the economic slowdown in the USA, the problems of the information and communication technology sector and the domestic restrictions put in place to combat foot and mouth disease, have dramatically changed our economic outlook for next year. As a result of this difficult economic climate, leading international and domestic commentators have reduced their forecasts for the economy for next year. The estimates by market commentators for GDP growth next year vary between 1.5% and 7%. The budget was prepared on the basis of a forecast for GDP of 3.9% for 2002. However, it is fair to say that while growth may average just under 4% for next year as a whole, we expect a pick-up as the year progresses and, consequently, the economy to grow at around 5% in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Though this is a period of uncertainty, we must not lose sight of the fact that GDP growth of the order of 3.9% for next year will be a source of envy to many of our EU partners. In this budget and over the last four years the commitments made to social welfare, housing, social services, health, education and science and job creation have been extraordinary. In terms of child benefit alone, the receipt by a family of four of over £417 per month was undreamed of when the Government took office. This reflects the commitment that the Government has brought to economic policy. One of the things that has underpinned that policy has been social inclusion. If an economy developing at the pace of ours does not ensure there is social inclusion, the outcome will not be beneficial for all. The figures demonstrate <Col N="308" /> quite clearly what has happened in the last four years in the delivery of the Government's five budgets which have given an enormous benefit to every man, woman and child. Whether one lives in Dublin or the regions, one can certainly see the substantive benefits in quality of life and standards of living.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is more to be done and more will be done by the Government and Fianna Fáil. The party has always been to the fore in delivering policies, radical and otherwise, needed to drive the economy. The Minister for Finance has been, without doubt, one of the outstanding thinkers in his Department in many a long year. The way forward is through his even-handedness, focus on the economy and belief that the way to ensure a future is to create jobs for all. That is what he has achieved in government in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget copperfastens the measures taken by the Government since coming into office to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to match demand, afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers, create conditions for a vibrant private-rented sector providing quality accommodation and increase social housing output. The Government published, Action on House Prices, in April 1998, which detailed the first of a series of major policy initiatives covering all aspects of housing. Its primary focus was to increase housing supply through a range of infrastructural and tax measures and to prevent investors pricing first-time buyers out of the market we inherited from the outgoing Government. These measures were supplemented in 1999 by further action on the housing market and in June 2000 the Government published, Action on Housing, which spelled out additional actions necessary to continue the momentum already achieved. In July 2000 the Government published the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government measures on the housing market have been remarkably effective. We built over 13,000 houses per 1,000 people last year, the highest rate in the European Union in proportion to population and about four times the United Kingdom rate. House completions last year reached almost 50,000 units nationally, the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. Since the Government took office, over 200,000 new houses have been built with record levels of output being achieved in each succeeding year. When we took office we inherited conditions in which house prices were out of control. House price inflation peaked in 1998 with annual house price increases reaching 40%. As a result of measures we have taken to increase the supply of zoned and serviced land, speed up planning procedures, reduce speculative demand and bring housing supply up to meet real demand, house <Col N="309" /> prices have been brought under control. House prices are now static in many areas and decreases are being recorded in the more over-heated sectors of the market. The annual rate of house price increases is now running at 5% to 6% compared to the levels of 1998. First time buyers now also have an increased share of the housing market as evidenced in the increased level of applications for new house grants and in the loan applications data.</P>
    <P>The developments in house prices and supply and the improvement in the position of the first time buyer have allowed us to introduce measures in the budget to deal with the rental sector. Interest deductibility against rental income for housing was withdrawn by the Government in 1998 as part of a set of measures designed to reduce speculative demand for housing, reduce pressure on house prices and create space in the housing market for first time purchasers who were our priority. The budget measure of interest deductibility as well as the changes to the stamp duty system whereby the rate applying to investors has now been aligned with that applying to existing owner-occupiers will encourage an increase in the supply of rental accommodation. Accommodation provided with the aid of interest deductibility will be subject to compliance with proper regulatory controls and to registering tenancies with the private rental residential tenancies board.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in the budget complement other reforms introduced by the Government on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, including those measures given effect to in the Finance Act, 2001, and they lay the groundwork for a diverse, properly functioning and well managed private rented sector. I also welcome the fact the deadline for the section 50 student accommodation scheme will be extended by two and a half years to 30 September 2005. This, along with other technical adjustments to the scheme and together with changes in interest deductibility and stamp duty, will ensure the 14,000 bed spaces of purpose-built student accommodation which are already in the pipeline can be brought on stream at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The Government can also claim credit for bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social housing. The 146 million provided in the budget is on top of the 1.46 billion of capital funding provided for housing in the abridged Estimates published in November. This is more than three times the amount provided in 1997. Last year we introduced a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme which provided initially for 22,000 local authority housing starts over the four year period. In our Action on Housing policy statement, we increased the programme to 25,000 new starts over the four year period. Last year local authorities started 5,000 houses. This year they will start 7,000 houses. By the end of this year we will have achieved about 50% or half the increased target <Col N="310" /> for local authority housing starts. Local authorities will complete or acquire some 5,000 houses this year and I anticipate some 6,000 will be completed or acquired next year, the highest level of completion for more than 15 years.</P>
    <P>On coming into office the Government quickly identified the important contribution the voluntary and co-operative housing sector had to make to tackling the growing demand for social housing. The Government's commitment to developing and expanding the sector and to giving it the necessary resources and support to enable it become an important and significant force in the housing area is reflected in the national development plan which includes ambitious targets for output by the sector for each year of the plan and provides the necessary funding to achieve these targets. Output by the sector last year showed a substantial increase in the number of units of accommodation provided, with some 950 units completed, the highest output by the sector since 1995. The indications are that output by the sector this year will be in line with the ambitious national development plan target of 1,250 units, the highest output ever by the sector. We are well positioned to exceed this next year and to achieve the national development target of 1,500 units by the sector. The target over the lifetime of the national development plan is to increase the output from this sector to 4,000 housing units per annum.</P>
    <P>Housing output from the local authority housing programme, together with output from the complementary social housing programmes of voluntary, affordable and shared ownership housing along with vacancies occurring in existing local authority housing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households to be met this year which is a credible achievement. Equally important is that the accommodation we are providing under our social housing programmes is of the highest quality in design and construction.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to overall housing need is credible. It is a comprehensive and, on foot of the budget, it continues to be well funded. We have been pro-active in our approach since the day we took office. We have increased supply to meet demand. By the end of this year the Government will have provided more than 18,000 local authority houses since taking office, with a further 4,000 in voluntary housing schemes. My Department has also provided funding for more than 5,500 units under the shared ownership scheme. In the period 1997 to the end of this year, the needs of about 47,000 families will have been met through the various social and affordable housing options. We took successful action to secure stability in house prices. We have demonstrated our commitment to meeting social housing needs and now, with the timely intervention in this budget, we can lend further support to the development of the private rented sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Ellis. I commend and congratulate the Minister for Finance and his officials on introducing one of the most innovative budgets in recent years. Its success and appeal is evidenced by the manner in which the Opposition has been left floundering and grasping at straws in a vain attempt to pick holes in it. It is the fifth budget introduced by the Minister and, no less than the first, it continues to deliver on the Government's programme. This is an outstanding achievement by an outstanding Government which is set to see out its full term in office. It has a record of which the Opposition can only dream and envy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said, but it is worth repeating to reinforce the point, that the budget's objectives are to develop infrastructure, improve public services, promote equality and sustain enterprise and investment in a way which sustains fiscal policy. The budget safeguards the vulnerable in society, prioritises our needs and continues to invest for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government's record in managing the economy has been very impressive. Growth has reached unprecedented levels, hundreds of thousands of new and sustainable jobs have been created and there is full employment. For the first time there is sustained immigration with tens of thousands coming to this country to take up work. We also have a measure of illegal immigration which would not take place if Ireland as a society and an economy did not have much to offer. Those dependent on welfare payments and pensions have received historic improvements in their incomes. The unique contribution made by carers in society has been recognised. Although the economy has slowed in the past six months due to the impact of foot and mouth disease and the terrorist attack on America, the position is by no means as bad as the prophets of doom and gloom would have us believe.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook for the coming year is sound. Economic growth is forecast to be just under 4%, employment will continue to rise by 1.5% until 2004, inflation will fall to 4.2% next year and to 2.25% by 2004, there will be another Exchequer and general Government surplus in 2002 and net current and capital spending will increase by 10.5% in 2002. This is not failure, it is success. Ten years ago such a projected performance would have been regarded as miraculous and well beyond our reach. I welcome the budgetary measures on personal taxation. The Government has transformed the tax code so that the ordinary person now gets to spend more of his or her own money. This represents a huge practical increase in the personal freedom of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget's business taxation measures have also been broadly welcomed by the business community. To those who would quibble with some of them, I say that business has benefited enormously from the positive environment created by the Government. The business community also <Col N="312" /> has a responsibility to make a contribution to society. Indirect taxation increases have been modest. In addition, the housing measures are most welcome in that they will encourage people back into the private rented accommodation market, thereby moderating rents.</P>
    <P>The further large increase in children's allowances will be welcomed by all mothers. The 1997 budget, presented by the famous rainbow coalition Government, provided £30 per child. By comparison, the current budget will give £92.62.</P>
    <P>Agriculture does not feature prominently in the budget which is a reflection of the fact that our society is now a predominantly industrial one. I welcome, however, the capital gains tax measures to compensate farmers for the compulsory purchase of their lands for road construction. These measures, taken together with the recent deal with the IFA, should go a long way towards securing acceptance and smooth progression of our vital national roads programme. I wish to compliment the Minister and the president of the Irish Farmers' Organisation, Mr. Tom Parlon, for their work in concluding this settlement.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural investment is to be further supported by the budget. When the Government returns to office after the next election, it will make the removal of infrastructural bottlenecks in transport, communications and roads a priority, in order that economic development and the regional development efforts of State agencies, such as the IDA, can bear fruit. We will, therefore, remain an internationally competitive location for inward investment. This is of major importance with EU enlargement around the corner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In reflecting upon this budget, we may also wish to consider what has occurred during the period since the Government assumed office. Deputy Johnny Brady outlined the enormous increases that have occurred in the budgetary provisions on child care. In the final budget presented by the rainbow coalition Government, in 1997, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, introduced a £1.75 increase in the old age pension. When the current Government took office and promised that old age pensions would reach £100 per week, or more, before it left office, many people felt it was a political promise that could not be kept. People realise now, however, that the Government kept its word. Following this budget, a non-contributory pensioner will receive £116 per week or 147.30. That represents enormous progress for those who are dependent on social welfare. Other welfare payments, including child benefit, provided for in the budget mean that a family with four children will receive approximately £417 per month. This is progress indeed, compared to the situation which pertained prior to this Government assuming office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the next general election, the Government will be judged on its record over the past five years. On behalf of my constituency, I wish to <Col N="313" /> express sincere thanks to the Minister for Finance for renewing the rural renewal scheme which has been of great benefit in encouraging people to live in the area. It has provided a confidence boost to those who live there as they will now be able to avail of opportunities of which they had been deprived for many years.</P>
    <P>The Government faced major problems in framing this budget. People may say that we have taken money from the social insurance fund, but we have been putting money into it and it is now in surplus. If it was necessary to withdraw money from the fund, then the Minister was right to do so. The fund has not been left in any jeopardy for the future. Let us be fair about this; we are living in very uncertain times as far as the world economy is concerned. The events of 11 September changed everything and we must wait and see how long that continues.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done a tremendous job in looking after people in need. The less well off have received a better deal from this Government than from any previous Administration. Given the welfare increases introduced since the Government came to office, people will appreciate that it has taken care of those in need. The increase in income limits for the carer's allowance is to be welcomed as it means more people will be eligible for the allowance. Carers require help to care at home for people who would otherwise have to live permanently in institutions. They deserve any support they receive.</P>
    <P>The increase in respite grants is also to be welcomed as is the doubling, from 5 December, of the widowed parent grant. All these measures lead people to understand that the Government is helping people in difficulty. When people analyse the budget, they will realise that the Government has lived up to its commitments. It has put 300,000 more people to work and has brought unemployment to a record low. Who would have dreamed five years ago that immigrants would have to fill job vacancies because there were no Irish people to do so? Nobody would have imagined five years ago that work permits would be sought in order to fill jobs to maintain our industrial growth.</P>
    <P>The Government has maintained its contribution to capital projects in the national development plan. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is to be complimented on the way he has dealt with the housing situation over the past five years. I know Deputy Durkan will laugh at this.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Bradford. An analysis of the budget by the justice commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, stated that it represented prosperity without fairness. While the budget's entitlements for old age pensioners are welcome, CORI's analysis stated:</P>
      <P>As a direct result of the choices contained in budget 2002, the number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to rise, the rich-poor gap will continue to widen, many people in low-paid jobs will gain nothing, families on very low incomes will not have the right to a medical card [which is a controversial issue in Sligo-Leitrim], and a large number of people will continue to wait for appropriate accommodation.</P>
      <P>After almost five years in office, the Government has failed to give priority to the deprivation being experienced by the country's poorest people. The CORI Justice Commission document states:</P>
      <P>While the country has been experiencing its most prosperous period ever, the Government's Budgetary choices have produced a situation where Ireland's poorest people are expected to live on £93.56 a week. Its choices have also widened the rich/poor gap by £191 a week. This is unjust, unfair and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had an opportunity in this budget to leave an economic legacy built on the political philosophy which he clearly worked on until now. However, he has fallen short. The Minister's smash and grab budget will add to inflation. Fuel increases of 25p a gallon will hit everybody but particularly those in small companies and small businesses. The VAT hike spends end for e-business growth and advance corporation tax increases will certainly put pressure on cash flow requirements of businesses by 800 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was designed to win the next general election but it has seriously undermined the medium to long-term competitive position of the economy. The Minister has effectively raided any reserves available to him so as to obscure the need for borrowing. However, spending increases will have to be met in future years when there <Col N="315" /> will be no more reserves. This is a once off reserve. We are looking at a budget deficit projection of 2.5 billion for next year. Questions will be asked as to where this is expected to come from. There are only 52 weeks to the next budget. It will require tax increases or borrowing. The incoming government will have a difficult job to do. If the Minister was trading in a company he would be charged with unethical trading given that he has borrowed money from three different sources to balance the books. The manner in which it was done has prevented borrowing. The difficulties involved with the euro changeover, compounded with the VAT increase, will add to inflation. There is a huge cost to business people caused by the euro changeover. The Minister has made a profit on the euro changeover to the extent of £230 million. The business people who have financed the euro changeover have gained nothing. The VAT increase changeover and taxation on plastic bags are introduced at a most difficult time. Business people and the bulk of the PAYE sector pay into the economy.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the level of increase in current spending at 10.5%. The stated objective of Government when taking office was to keep public expenditure increases to 4% per annum. These increases are on top of a 23% increase in 2001. The expansionary nature of this budget will have a serious impact on Irish competitiveness. Having fallen from a position of second place we now rank in eleventh place. The perception of Ireland as a competitive economy is very much eroded. I am concerned also about our ability to maintain existing employment and export markets. The growth of the economy has been on the backs of small companies employing fewer than ten people. This Government has not supported any small company in the past four years. We have seen a decline in the bigger companies. September 11 has been blamed for too much. The downturn happened way in advance of that date. Those who take the risk in business and employ people have been dealt only abuse. They have not been given an incentive or any encouragement. Given the high rates and all the additional charges on small companies, it is regrettable that the budget has imposed a further taxation on them.</P>
    <P>By capturing the windfall gains of the Central Bank, taking the surplus of the social insurance fund and bringing forward corporation tax payments the Minister has simply engaged in a &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; exercise. Given that he is expecting the cashflow of small companies I am concerned that the budget will damage Irish competitiveness, which is important for exports. The increases in VAT and tobacco will increase inflation by 1%. The increase on tobacco was not nearly enough. The opinion was expressed by the Minister last week that it would be increased by 1. This was playing to the gallery for election purposes. Had he increased the price of cigarettes by 1 those addicted to smoking would continue <Col N="316" /> to smoke and the social welfare increases would have been wiped out.  The increases in VAT will increase inflation by 1%. This brings Ireland's inflation rate to two and a half times that of the eurozone average of 1.6% and twice that of our major market and competitor the UK at 2.2%.</P>
    <P>According to the latest figures available from the Revenue Commissioners 88% of companies pay corporation tax on profits of less than £50,000, which is not a huge profit. The earlier date for payment for corporation tax will put a huge strain on cash flow in small companies who will have to pay 800 million up to a year earlier. This is cooking the books. This is unwelcomed in difficult trading conditions, particularly for companies in manufacturing and international traded services who are not experiencing a reduction in corporation tax. That is quite considerable.</P>
    <P>The higher VAT rate of 21% is negative and spells the death knell for the fledgling e-business sector. Consumers benefited by reductions of £220 million last year. This increase will drive consumer prices up again putting further pressure on inflation.</P>
    <P>On the question of VAT I was disappointed at the increase. The Minister's justification for VAT increases has been described as flawed and misguided. He penalised the public, rather than raised revenue in a more creative and transparent way. I am critical of the Minister for increasing VAT to 21% and would describe the move as misguided and unfair. I reject his contention that the reduction in the VAT rate in 2000 was not been passed on to consumers. This is a slight on thousands of hardworking people in the State. He indicated that this reduction was not passed on.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the VAT rate to 21% is an attempt by the Minister to raise revenue on the backs of consumers, when a more transparent attempt to raise revenue may have involved taking on the strong vested interests. It is ironic that the consumer has been targeted once again while large banks and insurance companies have escaped this budget without any new levies or taxes. The Minister increased this indirect tax, rather than risk alienating key vested interests. It is a lazy way of raising revenue. The Minister contends that the reduction in the VAT rate had not been passed on to consumers last year. The inflation figures do not sustain the Minister's claim that the reduction in VAT rates were not passed on to consumers. The claim is flawed and misguided and has been used as a fig leaf by the Minister to make unwarranted increases in consumer tax. His claim that business people did not pass on the reduction was unfair to the business community which applies the VAT reductions when they are introduced. I would be more than surprised if that is not the case. The increase in VAT and the euro changeover will cause business people major difficulties. The Minister started his career condemning the splurge economics in which he now engages. It is forecast that there will be a £2.5 <Col N="317" /> billion deficit at the time of the next budget, which will put major pressure on the economy.</P>
    <P>A survey reported in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, which was carried out in advance of the package announced, reveals that most people expected to be worse off following the budget. IBEC has criticised the reversal of the VAT cut in last year's budget. Small firms are also disappointed with many aspects of the budget.</P>
    <P>The elimination of poverty was not on the Government's agenda. Many people are expected to live on £93 per week. There has been talk of a weekly increase in benefits of £8 and several speakers have made comparisons to what was introduced during the term of the rainbow Government. However, the rainbow Government was only in power for two and a half of the past 13 years, Fianna Fáil-led Governments having been in power for the remainder. That is a long time for a party to be in government. The members of the electorate are intelligent people and they are not impressed. They will make their decision in the 2002 general election.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on the number of consultants employed on the national development plan and spatial strategy, on which progress has been disappointing. I have heard nothing about the development of the regions. The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan, has stated that north Sligo will be a growth centre when he is elected Taoiseach and I am certain that will be the case.</P>
    <P>They say in business that &ldquo;turnover is vanity and profit is sanity&rdquo;. The turnover of this budget is about vanity, by which the Government is completely driven. The sanity aspect is that it is predicted there will be a £2.5 billion deficit at the time of the next budget, a worrying indication. People may point to the success of the economy but they should note that the forecast for the economy was healthy during the two and a half year term of the rainbow Government led by Deputy John Bruton. We are now aware of the implications of a forecast of a £2.5 billion deficit at the time of the next budget. We all hear of the boom in the economy, but the members of the electorate know that pay day must come. People know they will have to pay higher taxes to sustain the Government's incompetence. If the Government was a company doing business, the board of directors would be sacked at the annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan correctly alluded to the position of the Eircom shareholders who were conned. The electorate has also been conned because, in spite of the Government's claims, pay day will come. Like the shareholders who bought into Eircom, the electorate will realise that where there should have been prudent management, the Government was a spendthrift.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot spend at the rate of 24% when there has been only an increase in the intake of 4%; the figures do not add up. It is similar to the case of profit in a business, there is an obtainable margin within which any business can <Col N="318" /> operate. The obtainable margin here has been burned out by the Government. What the Government is spending has quadrupled compared to the intake. This position cannot continue. I am concerned about the mismanagement of the economy. If the Government was a company, it would be charged with unethical trading. If the Minister for finance, an accountant by profession, had to submit annual accounts which showed he had taken the money from the accounts of three companies and put it into one account, that would not be allowed.</P>
    <P>People have bought into the social insurance fund and the perception is they are unhappy with the Minister's use of that fund. The Minister has also availed of the redemption of the euro changeover at a time when people are only coming to terms with the changeover. The newspapers report today that the Central Bank is not happy about this and has not agreed at this point in time to make this fund available. This area has been mismanaged.</P>
    <P>The health strategy was announced by the Minister for Health and Children with great fanfare. The Minister for Finance provided for only 1.5% of the cost of this ten year plan. It is a joke that the Government is talking about a ten year health strategy. It must assume it will be in Government for the next ten years but that will not be the case. If it is in Government for the next five months&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps enough has been said over the past 48 hours about the budget. The rather muted applause on the Fianna Fáil benches which greeted the Budget Statement by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, spoke volumes. Some Fianna Fáil Deputies were probably cautious because they gave previous budgets great rounds of applause, but within days, not to mind weeks, the flaws quickly appeared. The Minister no sooner sat down on Wednesday evening than it quickly became apparent to the public and economic commentators that the Fianna Fáil Finance Minister who spent many years in the late 1970s and early 1980s decrying the economics of his party and, in particular, decrying the economic policies of his former leader, Charles Haughey, had done a major U-turn. What we saw on Wednesday was one Charlie putting in place what another Charlie used to teach. The budget was about voodoo economics and funny money, phrases which have been used many times already. That is what we saw on Wednesday evening and the Minister of State knows it. We saw an attempt to cook the books.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in one of his first statements on Wednesday said he was not going to borrow money. That was to be the big case for the defence, that after five years of a booming Celtic tiger economy with the figures looking very dubious, the Minister was not going to borrow money. The official position is that the Minister did not borrow money. He did not beg or borrow and, although I will not say he stole, he certainly plundered the workers by taking the money from the social insurance fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason he would try to do that because it must be embarrassing for a Minister who got the figures so wrong over the past 12 months. He presented one set of Estimates 12 months ago but it has all gone wrong, and before I get a lecture from the Government benches about 11 September and the foot and mouth disease crisis, I accept there were unforeseen economic problems but the figures were going wrong even before the foot and mouth disease crisis arose here late last spring. How can the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, or any of his senior colleagues, explain why the figures were so far out? I appreciate that in the midst of the sense of embarrassment surrounding the Government it had to do something to con<Col N="320" /> ceal the fact that it got it so wrong, but plundering the social insurance fund and taking funny money from the Central Bank to cook the books is bad economics and bad politics.</P>
      <P>Cooking the books is not new to the Fianna Fáil Party. We saw it in 1981 from the former Minister, Gene Fitzgerald, and also in 1992, with the famous VAT at point of entry measure. That was another pathetic effort to cook the books. Fianna Fáil has the recipe in terms of cooking the books, but it is a pity that it has been used by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the last budget of this Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Every local authority in the country is facing a shocking waste management crisis, yet we are not doing anything to promote recycling. I thought the Government would have availed of the opportunity in this budget to put in place some tax reliefs to ensure that recycling operations could be set up. Recycling is expensive and is probably a loss-making operation, but it is absolutely necessary if we are to make any impact on cleaning up the environment. Most of us in this House have served on local authorities at one stage or another and are aware that every local authority is facing an enormous crisis, but Governments did not do enough planning over the years to tackle this problem. Within months in Cork, and I am sure in many other local authorities, there will not be any site to which people can take refuse. Recycling is pathetically insufficient and if the State cannot put recycling plans in place, we must give some incentive to private operators to do so. The budget should have been used to put in place financial packages to encourage movement in that direction and I am disappointed it did not happen.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that more was not done to kick-start the construction industry. It is an open secret that, over the Christmas period, 15,000 to 20,000 of the building workers who take holidays will not return to work. I appreciate the Government's decision in relation to interest on residential property which is a step in the right direction, albeit one which only corrects an earlier mistake. I am surprised something was not done in terms of new house grants as there were indications in that regard. A new house grant of £3,000 might have been of some advantage ten years ago, but with the average new house in the smallest town and village costing £120,000 and £125,000, a £3,000 new house grant is grossly insufficient. The Government should have considered the building industry in the budget. The Fianna Fáil Party, rightly or wrongly, claims to be the official voice of the construction industry and the friend of the builder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the politics, we must recognise that the building industry is in a severe crisis. We could have a lengthy debate about the social housing proposals from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. Not only do they not work, they are having the reverse effect. All of us are aware from our own constituencies that building projects have simply stopped. There are no new starts. I am not exaggerating. That is clear to everybody.</P>

      <P>Building projects are being put on hold and the budget could have been used more effectively to put life back into the building industry. It is a major employer and source of rev<Col N="322" /> enue, yet we have the longest ever housing queue. As for the 100,000 or 120,000 people on local authority housing lists, this budget told them they have to wait a little longer. That is unacceptable and I am very disappointed that progress has not been made in this area.</P>
      <P>There are certain issues such as housing on which, even with a limited budget, progress can be made if the political will exists to do so, but there is no political will on the part of the Government or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am sorry I do not have more time, but these are the crucial issues we must reflect on as a nation before the next general election because after five years of record resources, there is very little to show for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and Deputy Killeen. I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this budget debate, the fifth such debate of this Administration. In December 1997, when the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, announced the first of five budgets, few would have thought they would all come to pass. I want to dwell on a number of issues in the time available to me.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the work they have done for the elderly. When we came into Government in 1997, we said the old age pension should reach £100. We can all debate the merits or demerits of that, but the old age non-contributory pension is now £105 and the old age contributory pension is £116. It is vitally important that the people who have been living in terrible conditions and who have experienced very difficult times are rewarded at the end of their days.</P>
      <P>On the carer's allowance and providing people with incentives to care for their elderly relatives at home rather than depend on institutions, one of the issues in the 1997 election was the fact that home helps were getting £1.40 per hour. That was a very limited scheme, but home helps are now paid in excess of £6 per hour. A huge number of people throughout rural Ireland, including my constituency, now work as home helps. Travelling around, I find it one of the greatest schemes ever devised. It makes a huge contribution to ensuring that elderly people continue to live out their lives in dignity in their communities and with their friends and relatives. While people might argue that more can be done, at least pay has increased from £1.40 per hour to more than £6 per hour. I encourage the continuation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years vast sums of money have been spent on various sectors, including the sports capital programme on which I will focus. For smaller club organisations, whether GAA, soccer or other sporting disciplines, sports capital funding is vital. It is one of the key elements of Government funding. Having an excellent sports facility in a village, town or city might not capture every young person who might become involved in drugs or other difficulties, but it will provide <Col N="323" /> opportunities for many of them to stay out of trouble. There have been vast improvements in my constituency in this respect recently. Prior to 1997 the typical sporting grant was in the region of £5,000 to £10,000. Now sporting clubs in rural villages routinely receive sums of between £60,000 and £100,000 for proper sporting and dressing room facilities. It is high time rural areas had these facilities and I encourage the Government to ensure such funding continues.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, is present. In recent times, we have heard a great deal about capital funding for school projects. Again, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has allocated extra funding to the Department of Education and Science for schools. There is no doubt that primary schools, particularly the older buildings, were neglected in the past. One could argue that hardly a lick of paint was put on them. We have embarked on a major refurbishment programme. I am delighted such huge sums have been invested in schools in the past four and a half years. While I accept that for every refurbished school, another three or four wait in line, at least investment has started, particularly in primary schools where staff and pupils had to endure very poor and primitive conditions. I encourage the Government to continue the schools building and refurbishment programmes.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists in the health system are a major concern and have become an election issue. Everybody has a story to tell about the amount of time parents, grandparents or children have had to wait in the accident and emergency departments of public hospitals. A person with a sports injury might arrive at an accident and emergency department at 7 p.m. and be discharged at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. the following day. The Minster for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has recently published the Government's health strategy. We have heard about its faults and failings from the Opposition. However, for the first time, we have a strategy which accepts there are huge difficulties in the health service, is willing to tackle them and will make money available.</P>

      <P>In the 1950s, a programme to eradicate tuberculosis was introduced by Dr. Noel Browne who is now considered one of the great Health Ministers. As a result of the new strategy, the health system will acquire a reputation for greatness which people will attribute to the strategy of 2001 in the same way we now look back to the introduction of free education in 1968 as the origin of the Celtic tiger.

      <P>Planning, an issue which has been around in rural areas for some time, recently reared its head when An Taisce announced it would object to all once-off houses in rural Ireland. Politicians from rural communities have long argued for preserving rural post offices, schools and local identity. Allowing An Taisce to proceed down the route of appealing all once-off houses in rural areas would be detrimental to rural constituencies such as mine. It is a vital issue for the survival of many rural communities and I strongly oppose attempts by An Taisce to stifle the development of once-off housing.</P>

      <P>The policy platform on which this Government was elected was to grow the economy and reduce the burden of taxation on the backs of taxpayers. The Government has succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of even its most ardent supporters. Not only have most targets been met, they have been exceeded. Ironically the one target we have not managed to meet is the reduction in the top rate of income tax for the better off the Government is supposed to favour. However, we have gone 75% of the way.</P>
      <P>I want to take the few minutes available to me to puncture the bloated balloon of lies, distortions, half truths and downright misrepresentations that the tax and social welfare policy of the Government has been skewed in favour of the better off. Now that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has introduced five budgets in this House, we can examine his record. Deputy Noonan said this morning that he wanted to judge the Minister on his record so we will do that. The introduction of tax credits in 1999 was a seismic shift in the income tax system. That single move did more to introduce equity into the income tax system than any other fiscal measure since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>There was a fundamental inequity in the old personal allowances system which simply meant tax came off at the top marginal rate. When there were different rates for different categories of income earners, obviously those at the top end of the scale benefited most. That was recognised not just by this Government but by the Opposition parties. I recall many years ago the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, writing an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he proposed the introduction of tax credits. The difficulty was that Garret FitzGerald, the Labour Party and others agonised, speculated, wrote position papers, theorised and prevaricated about this issue. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, acted while others prevaricated, spoofed and waffled.</P>

Who favours the better off? As a result of this budget, a couple who are aged over 65 will not enter the tax net if their income does not exceed 26,000, or in excess of £20,000. A single person will not enter the tax net if he or she earns up to £165 a week.

      <P>The Deputy's definition of a generation is very different from mine. He will be aware that prices have not increased by 100% in the past five years. The policy of the rainbow Government was to increase social welfare by less than the rate of inflation, or 2.5%. Who favours the better off? Other social welfare payments have been increased by more than 40%. The contributory old age pension for a person with a dependant has increased to almost £200 per week, up 100% since the days of the rainbow Government. So who favours the better off? </P>
      <P>The Government has taken unprecedented steps, as was generously acknowledged by Deputy Quinn, to end child poverty. That has hardly been done to assist the better off.</P>

      <P>On health policy we have a two-tier health system of which the Labour Party made great play. We also had a two-tier health system when the Labour Party was in office for four and a half years. If we have a two-tier health system, which is something with which I ideologically disagree, it must be said that the vast bulk of expenditure on health goes to assist those who cannot afford private health care, those who are in the second tier. That expenditure was £2.7 billion per annum when the Government took office. It is now £6.5 billion to assist those who cannot afford the cost incurred in the first year&mdash;</P>

      <P>The budget provides for 1.35 billion net or 1.68 billion gross expenditure and for capital spending of 550 million. The capital spending is to be supplemented by public-private partnerships of which five are under way, including St. Caimin's school in Shannon of which I am a former board of management member. Some 42 further projects are being developed with an investment of 800 million in private funding in the infrastructure programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are significant changes in regard to taxation on housing. It is well known that I argued strongly against Bacon three, even though I must concede it played a part in controlling spiralling houses prices. Other factors clearly contributed to the slowdown in the house building programme. It has become extremely fashionable to attack building contractors and developers but it is useful to remember that, in addition to providing housing, they employ people. The employment is widely dispersed throughout the country and it is relatively well paid. The workers in that <Col N="329" /> sector had begun to be very concerned, and rightly so, and I am delighted that the Minister has made these provisions in the budget. At the end of the day, a sufficient supply of houses to meet demand will be the best device to control prices. I welcome the fact that interest relief is being restored as a deductible expense and I also welcome the changes regarding stamp duty.</P>
    <P>There has been some controversy about the fact that the Minister has decided to make use of the surplus income from the Central Bank. There is no advantage in hoarding cash reserves in that particular institution and I do not think anybody has argued with conviction that there might be any advantage.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund is strongly in surplus, with 1.4 billion at the end of 2001, and it will still have a surplus of 1.2 billion at the end of 2002. That is exclusively due to the Government's success in increasing and encouraging employment. It is important to remember that using part of this fund will help to sustain that employment and ensure that there is a reduced drawdown from that fund in the future.</P>
    <P>I also strongly welcome the fact that the Minister proposes to bring forward the payment of corporation tax to the current year. This will be done over five years, which I presume is as quickly as it could be done, and there will be a benefit of 792 million in 2002. As far as I am concerned, corporation tax is owed in the same way as PAYE income tax and should be paid. The sooner it is paid in the current year the better. Aside from the financial advantage in the current year, that initiative should have been taken long ago.</P>
    <P>The CORI document tends to be the bible of the Opposition to some extent in all budget debates and we all used parts of it when we were in Opposition. Unusually this year the first page of the document welcomes 11 Government initiatives. It makes the argument, which is the most common argument made against the Minister, that a couple on long-term unemployment assistance are only £48 a week better off after his efforts while a couple on the average industrial wage are approximately £130 better off. One of the points the document fails to advert to is that there are substantial attendant costs for those in employment. These costs are associated with going out to work and, ultimately, those who subscribe to a more tax on income policy are working against employment. The end result of a substantial increase in income tax, which is the only alternative to the policy the Minister has pursued, will inevitably cause the loss of a huge number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The initiatives welcomed in the CORI justice document are: the increases in child benefit, which are huge but not taken into account in the table I mentioned; the increased tax allowance for carers; the increase in old age pensions, which is beyond what was promised; the doubling of the widowed parent grants; the bringing forward of the payment of more social welfare increases to <Col N="330" /> January 2002, which is the time at which they should come into effect anyway; the increase in funding for special needs assistants in primary schools, which I welcome greatly having spent a long time working in the primary school sector; the increase in the back to school allowance for clothing and footwear, which is hugely important; the funding of the rural transport initiative; the general increases in health spending; the CAIT initiative; and the increase in the ODA budget to 0.45% of GNP, an important element which has not been referred to much.</P>
    <P>There is an additional allocation of £11 million for tourism marketing. As I said previously in the House on a number of occasions, the loss of any major percentage of the 36% of transatlantic traffic at Shannon Airport would be disastrous not only for the airport, but for tourism in the west. There is already a reduction in services arising from the events of 11 September; some losses in numbers are inevitable in that regard. A device should be found, preferably in the context of this kind of allocation and provided through the regional development authority, Shannon Development, to remove charges on all in-bound passengers to Shannon Airport for four years on all services, new and existing. It would benefit Aer Lingus enormously because that airline has most of the services in Shannon. It certainly would have a dramatic effect on bolstering the tourism sector in the west.</P>
    <P>It is as well to remember that the impact of tourism spending is much higher proportionately on the west than it is on other areas. While the gross amounts spent in the capital would exceed the amounts spent in the west, the impact of that spending in the west is enormous. Several studies explain why this is the case and anybody who lives in and represents that part of the country will be only too well aware of the impact the tourism spend has on the economy of the west. No initiative would have a more significant impact than one for inbound passengers. Obviously, no extra benefit would derive from such a measure if passengers whose journeys started in Ireland were included.</P>
    <P>The budget contains a commitment to the health strategy which was announced before the budget. This initiative has taken up a great deal of time in the media and some debate here and it is clearly required. In my constituency the plans for Ennis General Hospital are at a very advanced stage. The project team will report within a few days and a major extension will go to contract over the coming months. It is much needed.</P>
    <P>One of the things we in Ireland do not always realise is that all our European neighbours and other countries in the developed world have experienced enormous difficulties with their health systems. One of the enduring pictures from the British general election campaign last year was the attack on the Prime Minister by a lady whose partner had difficulty getting treatment. A member of my family, who happens to be in the <Col N="331" /> UK at present, sustained a sports injury and it was instructive to find that the level of hospital service and support one can get there is much worse than what is available in Ennis General Hospital. That is something I would not have known if it had not been brought home to me personally.</P>
    <P>There is also a project in County Clare about which I have been badgering the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for some time. This is the Stella Maris private nursing home in Lisdoonvarna, which has closed down. It was run by an order of nuns which, sadly, no longer has the resources or personnel to run it. I am confident that the additional allocation now available enables the health board to proceed with its plans to work in co-operation with the local community to re-open that nursing home. The people have been beating around the bush and chasing all kinds of daft initiatives for several months and it is time to get down to basics, deal with it and provide for it from the health budget.</P>
    <P>There is also an additional 100 million for improvements of the national roads. In Clare, the Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass, which is almost completed, will have the effect of taking the town off the first slot on all AA road reports where it has been for the past three or four years. Next to that comes the Ennis bypass. Obviously there have been difficulties in accessing land because of the dispute with the farmers, but that is close to being resolved &ndash; perhaps it is resolved &ndash; and I am confident that will go ahead, with a starting date in 2002. In addition, there is the Crusheen-Gort bypass. Aside from the advantages of reducing travel times for people who reside and must do business in that area, it will contribute enormously to allowing better access to the entire west from Shannon Airport and from the other access points along the west coast, all the way down to Rosslare.</P>
    <P>There is an additional 67 million in Exchequer capital funding for education. That is an enormous increase. There is huge demand, as the INTO list of substandard schools in the past couple of weeks showed. It is an issue which traditionally has been dealt with very slowly but this will have a substantial impact, particularly when taken in conjunction with the PPI initiatives. The provision for education of 560 million in 2002 is five times the 124 million provided in 1997.</P>

      <P>Looking back on it, the last episode of the famous &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; series was very prescient when the Minister McCreevy character dreamt restlessly and ceaselessly about how to balance the books for the 2002 budget. At one <Col N="332" /> stage it showed him trying to rob the Dáil bar and then outside selling the last of the Christmas wrapping paper. He came up with various other crazy plans.</P>

      <P>It is a late night show. It is sad that, in reality, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who was preoccupied when we met him occasionally in the House in the past few weeks, came up with similar ideas in that he raided the Central Bank, the national insurance fund and the capital services redemption account, where he got his hands on 610 million, 635 million and 500 million respectively. Most seriously, he grabbed money from the social insurance fund without any legal basis. Section 7 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill has a scant two lines which will attempt to give a cloak of legality to his illegal act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the three expropriations, the seizure of 40% of the social insurance fund is the most serious, utilising as it does for entirely different purposes a large portion of workers' PRSI. As my colleague, the general secretary of the ICTU, Mr. David Begg, rightly said on television on Wednesday, many imaginative and progressive ideas were suggested during the years by the voluntary community sector and among ourselves in the House as to how the 1.6 billion surplus could have been used, for example, to introduce a proper system of parental leave for men and women or a decent level of carer's benefit. Only about 300 people applied for the current benefit introduced two years ago. There are many other areas in which the money could have been better employed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's legacy will be one of division. A colleague this morning quoted the CORI analysis of the budget which has the headline, &ldquo;Five in a row &ndash; prosperity without fairness.&rdquo;  Its statement read: &ldquo;As a direct result of the choices contained in budget 2002, the number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to rise, the rich-poor gap will continue to widen, many people in low-paid jobs&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;which is understandable, because we remember the crazy legacy inflicted on us by a previous Minister for Finance, George Colley, and a Fianna Fáil Government 30 years ago. It is great that we got ourselves out of those disastrous circumstances. Governments, in which the Labour Party and our colleagues in Fine Gael served, played a large part in digging us out of the position in which we found ourselves after the crazy Fianna Fáil Governments of the 1970s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to see that the general Government debt to GDP ratio is heading towards 34%, but it must be remembered that it also reached its highest absolute level under the Minister. I agree with him that some of the macro-economic conditions facing us leave us with uncertainty. However, his reckless policy last year of driving the general Government balance from £3,500 million to a paltry £323 million was also a key factor in producing the circumstances that we now face.</P>
      <P>The Minister made little reference to the likely performance of the euro. We hope it will do well, but if it strengthens too much against sterling or the US dollar, there will be additional problems facing the incoming Government. What also has a bearing on the social welfare package is that, in anticipation of the euro, there has been widespread and massive inflation in food, services, insurance and drink prices in recent months. The Minister hopes the confusion accompanying the introduction of the euro after Christmas, in regard to social welfare rates, will spare his blushes, but those on social welfare and low incomes have already paid a bitter price for it, as Deputy Rabbitte has frequently highlighted.</P>
      <P>The Minister boasted of his extra £850 million, 1,009 million, in the social welfare budget, but because of the raid on the social welfare fund, the net increase is only 444 million, or £300 million, since the gross resources available to fund social insurance expenditure of £3.298 billion in 2002 were significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disappointing feature of the social welfare budget was the failure to accept the benchmarking report of the community and voluntary pillars and the trade union movement. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs accepted that we should try to move towards a target of 27% of gross average industrial earnings for the lowest social welfare payments by 2006 and that we should have a medium <Col N="334" /> term target of 30%, which would have meant that this year the Minister would have raised basic rates by an average of £14. Instead there is a miserable increase of £8.06 across all the social assistance rates, bringing long-term social assistance up to a miserable 118.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They asked for £14 and we gave them £9.50.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Long-term unemployment assistance, one parent family payment and blind pension were raised to £93.56 per week. Before Wednesday I argued that we should have a basic rate of £100, 127, per week which would have been a major step towards the benchmark of 27% of gross average industrial earnings. The basic Labour Party package would have cost only £743 million, 943 million. We wanted to create the circumstances in which by 2006 we could deliver the figure of 30% that our party leader guaranteed in recent months. I welcome that the Minister aligned short-term unemployment assistance and SWA with long-term assistance to create one fundamental basic rate of £93.56.</P>
      <P>The increase in the social insurance side was disappointing as rates of invalidity pension went up by only £8, under 66 widow's contributory pension by £8 and under 80 old age contributory pension by only £10. The Minister was constrained in these increases because he had raided the social insurance fund. Our package would have increased invalidity pension and other rates to at least £103.60, 131. As I said before, neither the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, nor the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, sought to develop a range of new benefits for workers and employers from the social insurance fund. Everyone agrees the qualified adult allowance should increase to 70% of the personal rate, but again this year the Minister was only prepared to move on £8.06. As CORI points out, the Government expects citizens to live on a miserable £69.31 or 88 per week. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs claims he has now reached the much vaunted £100 per week in respect of non-contributory old age pension. I commend the Government on achieving that. It is still, however, very far from the 34% which has been long advocated by my older colleagues in the ICTU senior citizens group in the seniors citizens parliament. They chose 34% as a reasonable amount. If it had been brought to that level this year, it would mean at least 160 per week.</P>

      <P>We are in a new era and in a few months' time the Deputy might be on a front bench. There could be a totally new situation. We must give great credit to our trade union colleagues and to the voluntary and community sector for the increases in child benefit. The extra <Col N="335" /> £25 and £30 are to be welcomed. It is disappointing, however, that the increases are not payable from 1 January and are backdated only to April. It is also disappointing that once again child dependant allowances have not been increased. Child dependant allowances and the fuel allowance are the major benefits which have not been increased during the lifetime of this Government. The child dependant allowances still stand at a miserable £13.20 to £17. We have had many complaints from widows with young families in that regard. The Vincentian partnership &ndash; Saint Vincent de Paul &ndash; strongly argued that we should have moved over a two year timeframe to bring all child dependant allowances up to £17. Unfortunately the Ministers, Deputies Ahern and McCreevy, have said no.</P>
      <P>Within minutes of the budget bring delivered I received a strongly worded fax from the Carers Association, the title of which read, &ldquo;Carers let down by budget again.&rdquo;  The association strongly attacked this budget which it regards as a derisory response to its problems. There is an increase of only £25 in the single disregard and only £50 in the married disregard. This still leaves the great majority of carers outside the threshold for the carer's allowance. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was in the House. I recall meeting the Carers Association seven or eight months ago when a message was sent to Limerick &ndash; the Deputies from Limerick may find this interesting &ndash; through Deputy O'Dea that in this year's budget the married disregard for carer's allowance would be on a par with the average industrial wage, £389 per week. It is an incredible let down that it has reached only £300.</P>

      <P>It is for this reason the Labour Party has devised a strong and comprehensive social inclusion policy for carers. As my party leader has said we will abolish the means test and replace it with a carer's payment. We would allocate a portion of this payment to those who are already on a social welfare benefit. We would introduce a cost of disability payment. We would organise a nationwide system of community care. The Government had five long years in which to deliver for the carers of Ireland and it did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annex C of the Budget Statement is supposed to be a poverty-proofing exercise for social inclusion. It is a derisory two page document which tells us very little. It grudgingly states that the impact of poverty is one criterion for assessing this budget. The impact on people who are poor is perhaps the most important criterion by which the budget should be assessed. Father Seán Healy and the CORI Justice Commission once again summed it up by saying this Government has widened the rich-poor gap by £191 per <Col N="336" /> week in the past five years. After five years we now have a more divided society than ever. The incoming Government will have a huge task in trying to restore social cohesion.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Browne <i>(Wexford)</i> and Wade.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan has outlined a litany of very desirable policy objectives but his party when in Government has been spectacularly successful over the years in not achieving measures to provide a more equal society. I refer to Deputy Broughan's comments in relation to the carer's allowance. This morning I did a radio interview on our local radio station with Mr. Collins of the Carers Association. He admitted that Deputy Dermot Ahern, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, has been most innovative. I commend the Minister on his work over the years. Deputies Durkan and De Rossa were spectacularly unsuccessful in their work in the Department of Social Welfare for a number of years. In 1997 there were 9,200 people availing of the carer's allowance. Today there are almost 20,000 people availing of the allowance. There has been an increase of 184% in the expenditure allocated for the carer's allowance scheme since this Government came into office. That is the record of success.</P>
      <P>This budget continues to help the older people who laid the foundation of today's economic success. We have increased the contributory pension to £116 and the non-contributory pension to £105. In 1997, Fianna Fáil promised to increase the pension to £100 and we have more than delivered on that. This budget is focused on the poor and the less well off. The personal tax credit and the PAYE tax credit have been raised significantly. This rise will take 68,000 low income earners out of the tax net. In the past five budgets implemented by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government, 380,000 people have been taken out of the tax net. I remind the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party that a massive £1.25 billion has been included in this budget for social inclusion measures. I remind Deputies Broughan and Durkan ,and particularly Deputy De Rossa, that the rainbow coalition Government allocated only £273 million for social inclusion measures in the 1997 budget&mdash;</P>

      <P>Between the Central Bank reserves and the social insurance fund, about 800 million is being transferred back to the Exchequer. In the coming year 1.035 billion will be transferred to the pensions reserve fund. What is being put in for pensions for the future far exceeds the amount that is being taken from the surpluses. I remind Deputy Durkan that, by definition, surpluses are over and above the requirements of the day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan's constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, has produced an excellent budget, which is innovative, provides for the further development of infrastructure and includes very positive social inclusion measures. Since the Government came into office in 1997, some 300,000 new jobs have been created. It is not many years since there were only 1.1 million people at work here and there are now 1.8 million people at work. That is predominantly due to the good management of the economy by the Fianna Fáil Party in Government. By any stretch of the imagination&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the Government has been extremely successful in ensuring people in receipt of pensions get a proper level of payment. Free schemes have vastly improved. Deputy Broughan referred to the carer's allowance. He conveniently forgot to recall that a carer's benefit scheme has been introduced. The free schemes have been extended to everyone in receipt of the carer's allowance. In 1997, child benefit was only £30 per month. There has been a massive increase in this figure, which fulfils a policy objective of Fianna Fáil's at the last election. I am very pleased that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been so successful in increasing so substantially the child benefit provisions and the provisions for old age contributory and non-contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>There have also been major improvements in taxation. The final budget of the rainbow Government allocated a mere £393 million for personal tax reductions. This Government has taken 380,000 taxpayers out of the tax net. There are now 690,000 income earners outside the tax net or 37% of all those on the records of the Revenue Commissioners. This budget will take 68,000 low-income earners and 11,000 elderly taxpayers out of the tax net. By any objective assessment, these are major achievements which are in keeping with the sound social philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party since its establishment in 1926.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has introduced a health strategy which will be most effective. The increased spending in the coming year will create 650 new hospital beds and will ensure that by the end of 2002 no adult will spend more than 12 months on a waiting list and no child more than six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> In recent years, under this Government, there has been a huge investment in infrastructure, roads, water, sewerage and housing in rural areas. There is vibrancy in these areas and rural regeneration is taking place. In areas where the population was declining drastically, that trend is now being reversed. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, introduced a number of measures to ensure the smaller towns and villages could meet the demand for housing. He has provided very substantial funding to ensure all our towns and villages can have water and sewerage facilities&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>In all my years I have never seen such lack of respect for people, particularly for the Ceann Comhairle. They were all great people two months ago when they gathered to make a presentation to him for 40 years' great service but they never seem to obey the Chair. There are just a few people who do this but when I see this sort of behaviour, I understand why so many members of the public do not vote.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth budget introduced by the Minister for Finance and I congratulate him on his achievement. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Ministers for Finance of all time. The budget represents an outstanding achievement by an outstanding Government which set out to complete its full term in office. Its record is the envy of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, and it is worth repeating to <Col N="339" /> reinforce the point, that the budget's objectives are to develop infrastructure, improve public services, promote equality and sustain enterprise and investment in a way which sustains fiscal policy. The budget safeguards the vulnerable in society, prioritises our needs and continues to invest for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in managing the economy has been most impressive. Growth has reached unprecedented levels, hundreds of thousands of new sustainable jobs have been created and we now have full employment. For the first time, there is sustained immigration with tens of thousands coming to this country to take up work. We also have a measure of illegal immigration which would not exist if Ireland as a society and an economy did not have much to offer. Those dependent on welfare payments and pensions have received historic improvements in their incomes. The unique contribution made by carers in society has been recognised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases being provided to old age pensioners and the infirm. I grew up in the 1960s and became a carer of my elderly parents before they died. We have seen tough days in the past. The elderly and infirm deeply appreciate the increases given to them in recent budgets. Many pensioners made an enormous contribution to building the country and they did not crib or protest. They were always happy with their lot. I am delighted the Government has increased the old age pension to which all old age pensioners are entitled. I also welcome the welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The Government's record of managing the economy has been impressive. Growth has reached unprecedented levels. Although things have slowed down in the past six months due to the impact of foot and mouth disease and the terrorist attacks on America, they are not as bad as the prophets of doom and gloom want us to believe. I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for the wonderful way they handled the foot and mouth disease crisis. I am sure Deputy Durkan, who is a good friend of mine, will agree that the House was united in its praise for how it was handled. The Minister played a blinder in that regard. We should pay tribute to the public for the way it responded to the appeal by the Department, the Minister, the Government and everyone to adhere to the stringent conditions which were put in place to keep foot and mouth disease out of the country. There was great co-operation, particularly among sporting bodies which played a vital role in calling off matches. It created many problems for the association in which I am deeply involved, the GAA, in terms of fixtures. However, everyone co-operated and we should pay tribute to them for that.</P>
    <P>We should also pay tribute to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, for the sports grants he gives to all sporting organisations. The Minister has an interest in and <Col N="340" /> has contributed to all sports. Sporting bodies will look forward to good news about sporting allocations which will be announced shortly. Although it is not in my electoral area, £200,000 was given in the budget to Neville Park in Rathkeale. That pitch was given to the GAA for a nominal fee by a famous family, the Nevilles from Kilfinny. Their father won an all-Ireland with Dublin long before my time or that of Deputy Durkan or the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>

It was an unusual development at the time because most big pitches were located in towns, such as Enniscorthy, Tulla in Clare and Bruff in Limerick. This pitch was bought to train teams in bad weather. Some £200,000 was given to it in the budget, which is welcome. Grants have also been given to rugby, soccer, GAA and community clubs in the county I represent.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook for the coming year is sound. Economic growth is forecast to be just under 4%, while employment will rise by 1.5% until 2004. Inflation will fall to 4.2% next year and to 2.25% by 2004. The people will see the budget as one of the best. People were prepared for a poor budget, but I know from the calls to my office, my clinic and my home that people, particularly pensioners and the infirm, are happy with it. There is still more to be done and I am sure we will do that when we return to power in May.</P>

        <b>: </b>We are aware that the Government has created an economic climate over the past five years which has helped all aspects of our economy. We have had one of the best economic performances in the world in the past five years. Many of our European partners are envious of that. We have created more than 300,000 jobs and long-term unemployment is down from 5.6% to 1.2%. It is expected that unemployment this year will remain at 4%. That is beyond all our wildest dreams, particularly if we go back ten or 12 years ago when the country was under the cosh.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recognition of the need to look after old age pensioners, people on social welfare, the sick, the disabled and the more vulnerable sectors of our society. For too long, particularly in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, they were not given the recognition in budgets they should have been given. These people built the State, raised large families and made all the sacrifices. It is only right that we should recognise their tremendous input in the difficult years of maintaining democracy to ensure we had a country of which we could be proud. I am pleased the Government has increased the personal rates for old age pensioners and people on social welfare over the past five years.</P>
      <P>It is seldom that a Government lasts five years and it is good for democracy and for us as politicians. We did not like having an election every two or three years in the early and late 1980s. It is also good that a Government honours its commitments. We maintained that old age pensions would be increased to £100 during the lifetime of the Government. We have gone beyond that and the public recognises it. I accept we had the finances to do it, but for the first time in many years a Government honoured the commitments given in a programme for Government. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach and to the Ministers for adhering to that. We can go to the country next May proud of our achievements. We can tell the people the Government has honoured its commitments and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all talked for many years about the burden of taxation. When I came into the House in 1982 there was no encouragement to work and the high rate of taxation was a disincentive. People stayed at home rather than taking a job. It was more productive to be on social welfare than to work. I am glad that has changed. The higher rate of tax has been reduced to 42% and the lower rate has been reduced to 20%. I hope whatever Government is returned after the next election will continue that reduction. There was a difficulty in reducing the rates this year because of finances, but there was still a widening of the bands and tax credits. It is my wish that we con<Col N="342" /> tinue, in the years ahead, to reduce the burden of taxation. Many people want to work. Young people, in particular, are earning and taking home very good money because of the taxation system now in place. Of those on low incomes, 380,000 have been removed from the tax net. I welcome the announcement in the Budget Statement that a huge percentage of those on the minimum wage are to be removed from the tax net completely. I hope all will be removed from it next year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the minimum wage was one of the most enlightened measures taken in my 19 years in the House. Young people were being exploited as were the not so young, particularly women. They were not being paid a decent wage. The minimum wage was introduced by the Government and has been improved annually. I hope the improvements continue because they ensure people have reasonable take home pay and are not dependent, as before, on the whims of an employer who decided whether to pay them £2, £3 or £3.50 per hour. Now they must pay them the minimum wage. This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The health service is a difficult area. We all recognise that over the last four years the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children have pumped substantial amounts of money into it, yet it seems the system has not improved. I certainly welcome the Minister for Health and Children's recent health strategy and the proposed root and branch examination of the health service. I ask him to look seriously at the health boards which are the greatest load of bureaucratic nonsense. They are top heavy with administrators, hospital management and senior managers when what is needed is staff at the coalface. I ask the Minister to consider a more localised structure. The county structures in the past worked very well. Subsequently, the monstrosities of the health boards were built up and little empires created by chief executive officers and middle and senior management. Serious consideration should be given to their abolition.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, where funding of £12 million was announced three years ago. Due to the bureaucratic nonsense of the South-Eastern Health Board, the project for which that money was set aside has not even got to tender stage, while half the money has been siphoned off for other hospitals in the health board's region. I ask the Minister to ensure the project is started as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about nursing home subvention. The cost of keeping old people in nursing homes has escalated enormously. There is a need for the Minister to look at the allocations. Beds are costing £350 to £400 per week. If an old age pensioner has £110 from their pension, they have to make up £300. It is difficult because the subvention varies from health board to health board. Some meet the full difference while others only give a percentage. I ask the Minister, therefore, to look at instructing health boards to grant <Col N="343" /> the full amount to enable older people to stay in nursing homes. I have dealt with cases where people had to leave nursing homes because they could not make up the difference. The introduction of a home subvention scheme would facilitate the many people who would be prepared to keep older people at home if they received an allowance. Due to the costs involved they are not doing so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the budget is a positive one. I listened to Deputy Durkan's colleagues state that it is an election budget. I hope that is true and that the people take on board what the Opposition is stating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

Given the time of year, others describe it as a surprise Christmas stocking, full of brightness, colour and promise, but containing a few bangers. It is intended to tap into the feel-good factor. I describe it, most accurately, as the hoodwink budget because the public is about to be hoodwinked in a way it has never been hoodwinked before.</P>

      <P>I feel so sorry for the Members opposite because their time has come. It has been brought forward much, much faster than they would ever have thought. I have heard those on the other side of the House reminisce about great things such as the increases in social welfare going back five years. Five years of water has passed under the bridge and we have come to a juncture where the public has to ask if things are as good as they were promised they would be. The answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The people have definitely been hoodwinked, but, fortunately, they will not be hoodwinked any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Let us look at a few of the hoodwinks. Five years ago the average household shopping basket cost at least half of what it does now. Insurance costs were at least half of what they are now. One can think of more important examples. The family home was half the price it is today, as was the number of people on local authority housing lists. The number on hospital waiting lists was half what it is now. Under every single heading where the Government parties have attempted to bask in the reflected glory of the budget, there are negatives and the people have paid.</P>
    <P>On the Sunday before the last general election there was a headline in a famous daily newspaper which read, &ldquo;Payback time&rdquo;.  Little did it know what the public was going to be led into. How could a Government which had so much money and so great a surplus over the last five years bring a 3.2 billion surplus to a 2.2 billion deficit all in one go? The Government is not getting full credit for what it has done. It has achieved almost the impossible and gone into free-fall in the space of one year. How was it done? This is a hoodwink budget because it is calculated to make the public feel good for the shortest possible time, just like a painkiller. The only problem with a painkiller is that it does not take away the cause of the pain. It may take away the pain momentarily, but one has to suffer when it wears off.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the housing market and what the budget has done for it. It has done absolutely nothing. I heard various Members on the other side of the House eulogising the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to housing. The market is a disgrace and I cannot understand the reason nobody on the benches opposite realises it. There has never been such a housing crisis in this country since it was founded. I do not know from where the inspiration comes. More than 100,000 people are on housing lists throughout the country, and another 100,000 cannot buy a house because of house prices. What is the Government talking about? The housing situation is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>When it was recognised the health services were in a shambles, the Minister for Health and Children thought some dramatic action had to be taken. The Government could not proceed with the budget and not mention health, so something had to happen before it. What did it devise for those who have been waiting three, four or five years for hip replacements and heart surgery and who have even had to wait for chemotherapy? A few days before the budget the Government unveiled a ten year plan.</P>
    <P>What in heaven's name will a ten year plan do for someone who is in pain and needs urgent attention? What in heaven's name will happen to the families of those people who require attention now and not in ten years' time? There is nothing for people seeking health services. There has been nothing for the past five years and there will be nothing for the next ten. Hence the plan. We hear about plans to solve every problem but we do not hear the resolution of the problem. We <Col N="345" /> hear what could be one but we never see it done. We hear about the action it is necessary to take but we do not see it taken.</P>
    <P>What has happened with transport after five years of this Government? It is something else. One can scarcely get out the gates of Leinster House. One sometimes has to wait 45 minutes to get out the gate, let alone drive across the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Soon a bike will not be safe either because going by balloon will be the only way one will be able to travel in this country. This will be hastened by the fact the Government will probably increase fuel prices to such an extent that one will not be able to travel by road or air. The transport situation is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>To add insult to injury, a few weeks ago a train was placed on tracks outside the gates of Leinster House, but there were no tracks at either end of the train. It was meant to make people feel good.</P>

      <P>The big bang has happened, the people feel good but the sting has yet to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter people will be anxious to recall and the Government will be anxious for them not to recall and which was referred to already by our party leader, Deputy Noonan, is the Eircom flotation. That was some achievement. The Government spent £78 million on consultants to assist it with the flotation. It cost £78 million to tell the people that this flotation was the greatest thing that ever happened, that it was imperative they <Col N="346" /> became involved in it and that they spend as much money as they could on it and borrow, if necessary, which many did. Elderly people were encouraged to invest their life savings in it and young kids went to their piggy banks and took out their money to invest in it. Thinking the Government was being honest, the people took their money from their piggy banks and savings accounts and invested it in Eircom.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago they received letters in the post to the effect that it was proposed to take their shares from them at a fraction of the cost they paid for them and that, if they did not wish to sell, the shares would be taken anyway. Members of the public who fell for that, hook, line and sinker, thinking they were supporting a national enterprise and the telecommunications infrastructure of the country, paid an unbelievable price. Some of my constituents have shown me the letters they received informing them of the urgent necessity to sell their shares at a price over which they had no control. These unfortunate people thought they would have an investment for about ten years and that they might have a little nest egg at the end. Imagine the disappointment of young kids, teenagers and students who, advised by their parents, may have invested whatever small savings they had in what they thought was a safe Government flotation.</P>
    <P>It is the one area which will cause the greatest disappointment and upset when the public comes to pass judgment on this Administration. The one thing that a person should never do is disappoint those who have faith and confidence in him or her and who rely on him or her to do the right thing. Where did it all go wrong?</P>
    <P>The Government has lived on a type of merry-go-round or carousel. Its thinking is that we had a surplus one year, we will have one the following year and probably one the year after. It is not a question whether we will or not but how large the surplus will be. However, it has all been whittled away.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the shortage of houses, the lack of transport and the Eircom flotation. Reference was made to agriculture. Like everything else, that sector is being cosied along. There was no reference to it in the budget and there is no long-term plan for it. The Government has a happy-go-lucky approach, hoping someone will throw a lifeline or that Brussels or someone will look after it. There is no long-term plan or clearly defined objectives and certainly no confidence in the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>Inflation has decreased because practically everything has come to a halt all of a sudden. The Government blames this on the events of 11 September or foot and mouth disease or some other cause. Certainly it could not be accused of anything itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those events had no effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Other economies have not taken the same dent as ours has and we should not <Col N="347" /> delude ourselves about that. Some economies have shrunk by 0.5% whereas, in this country, we had surpluses of £2 billion and £3 billion in recent years and this year a deficit of £2 billion. How did we manage that? How does one manage to have a £5 billion shift in one fell swoop? It certainly was not because of 11 September or foot and mouth disease. There must also be other factors, and the sooner the Government wakes up to that fact, the better for everyone concerned. Otherwise, people will begin to ask serious questions.</P>
      <P>This is a hoodwink budget. The Government hopes next April and May will come and go without the public recognising what the budget contained. That will not happen, however. Those days have gone. I do not think one can cod people like that anylonger.</P>
      <P>There have been continuing references from the Government side of the House to what social welfare payments and taxation levels were like five years ago but, sadly, they ignore the reality of what has occurred in the meantime. The household shopping basket has doubled in price, along with countless other household items, but I have not heard any Government speakers mentioning that fact. Could it be they do not understand what is happening? I doubt that because there are many decent people on that side of the House. It must be the case, therefore, that the Government scriptwriters do not want them to acknowledge what is happening.</P>
      <P>Housing is the biggest issue in my constituency but, instead of providing houses, the Government, through the local authorities, offers plans for the future. We have a ten year plan for health and a 20 or 30 year plan for housing. It will take 50 years to solve the housing problem, if it is ever resolved which I doubt. I compliment the Government, however, on reducing people's expectations in that regard. The average young couple no longer aspires to own their own house because it has gone beyond their reach.</P>

      <P>Once upon a time, the catch-cry of experts was that we were selfish and too many people owned their houses, and we should become more cosmopolitan and perhaps more continental. They said we should aspire to renting our houses or even leasing them. Now, the leasing option has definitely gone because nobody can afford a lease any more. Renting is the last resort of the unfortunate people on the housing list. That option has gone too, however, because about 40 people are seeking every single house that is available for rent in my constituency and the result is that rents have been driven through the ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a great achievement for the Government, in the space of four years, to deprive people of any hope of owning their own home or even renting one. The only thing the Government <Col N="348" /> can offer people seeking accommodation is a plan for the future. They say, &ldquo;It'll be all right on the night. Sometime, somewhere down the road, we'll help you with your housing situation&rdquo;. It is an absolute disgrace. I cannot understand why nobody on the Government benches recognises what is happening. Over the past few days, I have listened to various speakers, one or two of whom mentioned that An Taisce is objecting to developments in the countryside while somebody else is objecting in the towns. Yet nothing is being done about it. If our population is rising and our economy is expanding at the rate Government Members claim, something must happen. People will have to live in houses.</P>
    <P>In the former Communist countries, they built multi-storey blocks on the outskirts of towns and cities. They said, &ldquo;It's good enough for you. You can live there and see how you like it&rdquo;. Nowadays, people go to look at those blocks to see what it was like to live in such an environment. In a few more years that will be happening here. I would not like anyone on the Government side to think I am saying this for political purposes. This reality is now dawning on us. Nothing has been done to deal with the housing shortage which is the most disastrous since the foundation of the State. I cannot understand why it is not being recognised by the Government which has taken no action at all.</P>

      <P>The housing shortage saddens me. I was a member of a local authority for many years, but I have never seen the housing situation like it is now. In the really bad days when there was no money in the Exchequer &ndash; a time that is now being condemned by Members on the Government side of the House &ndash; local authorities were building houses and people were buying homes. The private and public sectors were working hand in hand. During the four year period from 1982 to 1986, some 1,700 home loans were offered by the local authority of which I was a member. Therefore, 1,700 people bought houses who today would not be able to do so.</P>

      <P>Some 1,700 people got houses who otherwise would not have. Now, however, there is a housing emergency. Countless numbers of people are looking for houses and the Government is not bailing anyone out. The Government is ignoring the problem. Nothing is being done for those people. In the same 1982 to 1986 period, the local authority of which I was a member, built up to 350 houses per annum. In the halcyon days of the present economic upsurge, the best they could do was about 130 in a single year. It is a disgrace. Where does the Government think people will live?</P>
      <P>Everything nowadays comes down to economics. An Taisce and the planners tell us it is cheaper to house people in high density areas in cities and towns but we already know that. In fact, the cheapest way to house the entire population would be in one massive block with a single pipeline for all the utility services. In that way, we could solve all the economic problems. Unfortunately, however, there is a high social cost to be paid for that kind of foolhardy planning. That cost has been visited upon various other economies throughout the world over the past 50 years. If anyone wants to choose that option they should ask why huge tower blocks are being demolished, not only in this country but all over Europe. It is because they have failed and there is no merit in that type of development.</P>

      <P>The problem facing the homeless &ndash; and by homeless I mean those who cannot buy a house &ndash; is that they are forbidden to build in either urban or rural areas. Where are they going to go? What is the Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government doing about it? Absolutely nothing. Somebody, somewhere will have to investigate that and the outcome will be interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased costs in the budget are hammering the road transport sector. We cannot bring heavy goods around the country on a bicycle, unfortunately, but it is certain that increased transport costs in the budget will be passed on to consumers. That, in turn, will erode any benefits in the budget to any sector. When this budget is fully and finally uncovered after the general election, it will be seen for what it is &ndash; no asset as far as the general public is concerned. Unfortunately, people cannot get a home. Nor can they gain access to health services. It is impossible to get transport, public <Col N="350" /> or private, or to get in or out of our towns and cities or villages due to a lack of proper access.</P>

There is no question about that as the Minister has dipped into a number of honey pots and we will eventually feel the sting in the tail.</P>
      <P>I wish to take up a number of points raised by the previous speaker. Some Deputies across the floor are well aware of the housing problem from their constituents. Some 140 million has been allocated to deal with the local authority housing lists. We are talking about 1,200 houses. By my calculations, that will cover only one in every 40 people on the housing lists.</P>

      <P>One in 40 people will benefit. That is not dealing with the housing crisis, that is paying lip service to the housing crisis. I have enormous sympathy for the people who come to see me in my clinic on whose behalf I contact Dublin Corporation. What can I say to them? I must tell them the Government has pandered to the speculators and the landlords but has not helped the ordinary people, it certainly has not done so in this budget. To take up the point made by Deputy Durkan, my solution is not to house people in tower blocks. Ballymun is an experience that should not be repeated, neither is building houses in isolation the solution. Proper planning such as works in other countries is required. Eco-villages, an idea the Green Party has advocated, would be a workable solution. Unfortunately the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in spite of representations made to him, has simply ignored it.</P>
      <P>We have had the launch of the ten year health strategy. The people are wise enough to know they will not see its benefits. There has been an increase in the price of cigarettes. It was interesting to observe a female smoker on television the other night saying the Minister was great. She had expected a huge increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes which only increased by 10p.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil press office has done a splendid job in spinning because this lady was absolutely delighted. She thought the Minister had fought against those people who recommended a higher increase. In fairness to the Fianna Fáil Party, it has devised a strategy over the years whereby if one treats people like idiots, they like you for it. I do not know if that will work in the next election. I am of the view that they are not all idiots and some of them will suss the Government eventually.</P>
      <P>There has been a 50% increase in health expenditure in recent years but it must be recognised that we are coming from an extremely low base and that the percentage of GDP spent on health continues to lag considerably behind our European Union counterparts. Questions must be asked about efficiency. I do not believe the health strategy takes on the vested interests</P>
      <P>The whole question of transport and quality of life issues has not been addressed in the budget. There was no attempt to introduce a proper climate change strategy. Reference was made to sulphur dioxide which has nothing to do with climate change. I attended a lecture recently which showed that sulphur dioxide actually slows down global warming, if anything. Spending on public transport <i>versus </i>roads is still more than a 2:1 ratio in favour of roads. That is not the way to proceed. We will continue to get gridlock and nothing in the budget addresses that problem.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Brady. I want to deal with the contribution of the previous speaker which was mild compared to some of the economic illiteracy we have come to expect, not so much from the Green Party but from Fine Gael. In recent days, it has been startling how illiterate Fine Gael has become on economic matters. Deputy Gormley is factually in error when he states that spending on health is lagging behind that of other EU countries. My information, thanks to the budget and successive budgets of the Government, is that health spending in Ireland is equivalent to the EU average. That is an enormous improvement on the situation we inherited on assuming office almost five years ago. We inherited a situation where the health service was chronically under-funded.</P>
      <P>We face a situation where the health service is in need of reinvestment of a particular kind, specifically in terms of bed numbers. That capacity constraint is resulting in many of the queues and delays in our hospitals. Those treatment delays will be addressed over a period. We cannot wave a magic wand and cure it overnight. There is an underlying bed capacity problem which requires capital spending of a high order. That will involve investment in hospitals and their ability to deliver the number of beds for a burgeoning and growing population which is becoming more prosperous, thanks to the wonderful measures introduced in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that the Minister will be <Col N="352" /> judged by the historians and, in particular, by economic and financial historians for the period of the late 20th and early 21st century, to have been one of the greatest Ministers for Finance the country ever had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has supervised a period of inordinate and enormous growth in the past three years, a year on year growth of 9%. This is extraordinary. These are figures which the French would say are <i>sans pareil,</i> without comparison. We may never see times like this again. We have never had them before and it is arguable that we will ever have them again. This is a power house economy which has gone from being a relatively poor country in the 1980s to being extraordinarily affluent today. Some argue it is the 20th richest country in the world while others contend we are in 40th position.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all of this, in terms of democratic standards and performance we are up there with the best in the world. Having recently returned from England, I am struck by how much higher the standard of living is in Dublin <i>versus</i> the British capital and other parts of England. We are now beyond comparison with the UK and have lost the old chip on our shoulders. For this reason, I was disappointed with Deputy Jim Mitchell's response to the budget. His speech was littered with the kind of comparisons with the UK that Ireland used to go on with interminably in the old days when the country could have been characterised as a post-colonial State. That was the hallmark of Deputy Mitchell's speech. He was trying to make bogus comparisons between Ireland and the UK when everybody knows we have passed out the UK in terms of the standard of living we enjoy. We have passed out the best lifestyle opportunity available to people who live in London. It is extraordinary to be able to say that. I emigrated to London in the mid 1980s and when I hit there I thought it was a far wealthier country than the one from which I had come, which it was in objective terms, but that is no longer the case. Dublin, as a capital, enjoys a higher level of wealth than London. That has all happened in the past five or six years.</P>
      <P>That has happened because the Minister has taken a few basic nostrums and implemented them in a programmed way through various budgets, of which this budget is the final one and perhaps the greatest, given the difficult and straitened economic times in which we are living. In the few simple principles he adopted, he has tried to return taxpayers' money to taxpayers through a mixture of cutting taxes, rising the bands and taking more and more lower paid people out of the tax net to encourage people to go out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us who campaigned for the first time in 1995 and 1996 prior to the last general election noticed the level of complaint among the electorate about why there was no incentive for many people to go out to work and why, if they did, <Col N="353" /> they would be punished. Those people were in a tax or income trap, which meant that in a good number of cases people were better off on the dole or drawing social welfare benefits rather than going out to work. We have all noticed the effect these tax cuts, tax changes and reforms have had on people in our constituencies, particularly in the more disadvantaged areas, who previously would have been better off staying at home and drawing the dole. That is the underlying message coming from Deputy McCreevy's budget. The incentive to work exists and there are employment opportunities because the Government has supervised a period of extraordinary growth in employment.</P>
    <P>That has come about mainly through foreign, direct investment. The foreign investors cannot be all wrong. They see the confidence in this economy, the trained work force, the confidence with which this Government is implementing its programmes and plans. It is not easy to supervise an economy that has been growing like ours at the rate of 9% year on year for three years. It puts pressure on the health service, infrastructure and on almost every aspect of State or publicly delivered service because it is difficult to catch up with that type of growth, which is the reverse of the position in the 1980s. At that time there were outflows of 25,000 to 45,000 people every year, depending on whose estimates one believes, but certainly a minimum of 25,000 people left this economy every year in the 1980s. The position is now reversed and that number of people is now flowing into the economy and there is also the factor of the natural growth in the population.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the level of economic illiteracy evident on the Fine Gael benches in response to the budget. I was surprised that Deputy Noonan trusted his number two to try to attempt to nail the budget. I want to put out one message. Deputy Jim Mitchell's speech in response to the budget made no impact, nor did any of his subsequent TV interviews. He seems to lack the basic requirement or even the killer instinct that Deputy Noonan has in relation to budget day speeches. Deputy Mitchell's punches did not hit the target and were well wide of the mark. I am sure if Deputy Noonan had the time, he might consider changing his Finance spokesman in the months ahead, but he will not have the time to do that because we are on the road to an election.</P>
    <P>Many people have asked if this is an election budget. It is because we are approaching an election year. This is a very good election budget. This party will be able to use the budget as a platform to build a case, and I advisedly say this, argue and make a positive injunction to the public to put a Fianna Fáil majority Government back in office. We have demonstrated over the past five years how we can run the economy and make it an inordinate success compared to what was there previously, even under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In the next few months leading up to the general election people should examine and evaluate <Col N="354" /> the budget, the strategy on health care and the moves and strides we are taking to address the infrastructure deficit. They should ask themselves a simple question, which of all the political parties in Leinster House will be able to deliver on the marvellous promise we have created over five budgets? Will the next Government be a mixture of Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party or some other eclectic mix of smaller, more fragmentary parties? I say definitively that those parties cannot rule this country. They cannot deliver on the promises they make. They cannot deliver on the type of economic success achieved by Fianna Fáil in coalition with the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The parties opposite are weak and divided. They are parties of false promises. They make promises and say they will do this and that, but they will not be able to deliver on them. Fine Gael, which regards itself as a Christian Democratic party or a right of centre party, will go into Government with the Labour Party, which now composes elements of the old Democratic Left &ndash; some call them socialists, some call them &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo;, some call them liberals, but those in the Labour Party are very confused. They are being outflanked in the socialist department by Sinn Féin. That was evident from Deputy Quinn's performance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; when he was very comprehensively defeated by Mr. Adams, which was hardly surprising given his lacklustre performance.  </P>
    <P>I argue that the people will not vote for a motley coalition of three parties who are virtually incoherent on economic issues. All they can do is criticise the positive measures introduced by the Government, but they have not suggested any alternatives. It is interesting that Deputy Bruton, the former leader of Fine Gael, made that exact same point on the abortion issue. He said in a recent contribution that it was not enough for Fine Gael simply to oppose the Government policy on abortion without putting in place an alternative. Fine Gael is not interested in putting forward an alternative proposal because it knows that if it does so, it will not only be rejected by the public but that Fine Gael, even if it enjoys a modicum of success in the election, will be in office in coalition with the Labour Party who will geld all those policies in the time honoured fashion as it always does. When Fine Gael goes into coalition, its desperation for government means that it surrenders on virtually all its support and on all the policies it has neatly devised in the previous few years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most opportunistic dive Fine Gael has made on economic matters in recent days has been the absurd promise made by Deputy Jim Mitchell, who signally failed to make any impact in his response to the budget, of an offer of £20 million for taxi men by way of compensation. This was produced as if by magic, like a rabbit out of a hat, and I do not believe for one minute that the taxi men, their wives and families, who feel very injured and damaged by deregulation, <Col N="355" /> will take the offer of £20 million from Fine Gael at all seriously. I do not think anyone would take such an offer seriously. Deputy Mitchell, who prides himself on respect for the public finances, given his previous role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, has said this offer is an open cheque book, the £20 million is only an initial offer and that if there is a need for more he will keep signing the cheques. This is a bizarre offer from a person who spent the past four years lecturing and preaching us on the need to protect taxpayers' money. Now he wants to give an open cheque book to Vinnie Kearns and Tommy Gorman. Having met those gentlemen recently, I do not believe they will put much faith in Fine Gael's policy, given that its policy on this seems to be two headed. On the one hand, Deputy Jim Mitchell, is trying to love bomb the taximen and, on the other hand, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, is decrying them from pillar to post up and down the country, and in every newspaper and media interview she makes no secret of her dislike for this profession. I doubt very much that the taximen will see Fine Gael as their friend, notwithstanding the £20 million offer that is being brandished at them.</P>
    <P>I was to deal with one or two important measures in the budget. One is the tax relief being given to many tireless workers in football and sporting clubs throughout the country who are trying to raise funds to build facilities. This enlightened move by the Minister will be a major incentive to them as they go about selling tickets to raise money to build extra changing rooms or whatever.</P>
    <P>The increases for the elderly and children, in addition to the general round of social welfare increases, are welcome and give the lie to the assertion that we are not looking after the less well-off. The whole thrust of this budget and the previous four has been about giving the less well-off the opportunity to work, but also protecting those who cannot go out to work by increasing social welfare rates. That is the hallmark of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his officials on one of the most innovative budgets in recent years. The Opposition cannot make any serious criticisms about its contents and, as a consequence, has been flailing around aimlessly in recent days.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth consecutive budget delivered by the Minister, which must be something of a record. The budget is an outstanding achievement by an exceptional Government which will fulfil its stated intention of seeing out its term of office. The antics of the Opposition are largely a product of frustration and envy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objectives of the budget are to develop our infrastructure, improve public services, promote equity and encourage enterprise and investment in a way that sustains fiscal policy. It safeguards the vulnerable in society, prioritises <Col N="356" /> our needs and continues to invest for the future. The Government has a solid record of economic management. Over the past four and a half years growth has been unprecedented in the history of the State. Hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created and unemployment has been rolled back, particularly in areas of social and economic disadvantage. Since the last election, most are now at work rather than wasting away on welfare. The Government has created full employment. In the past year alone 40,000 people have come here to work legally under the work permit scheme, with many more thousands working here illegally. Those people would not come here to work if our society did not have something going for it. As Deputy Lenihan said, we should be proud to be Irish.</P>
    <P>Commentators such as those in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the RTE economics correspondent and so on who are lapsing into the old negativism and begrudgery should be ashamed of themselves. Not only have the unemployed and those in employment prospered under the Government, but those who rely on State benefits and welfare supports have benefited enormously across the board. They have received historic increases in income. There has been a huge increase in children's allowance and carer's allowance in recognition &ndash; rightly so &ndash; of the major contributions made by mothers and carers to society.</P>
    <P>The economy has slowed down in the past year due principally to the foot and mouth disease outbreak and the terrorist attack on America, but that is not the disaster the Opposition is trying to make it out to be. Such growth could not continue indefinitely. The economy was showing dangerous signs of overheating through excess demand in a number of areas, and the slowdown gives us a welcome opportunity to take stock and consolidate the gains made under the Government. The economic outlook for the coming year is sound. Economic growth is forecast at just under 4%. Employment will continue to rise by 1.5% until 2004. Inflation will fall to 4.2% next year and 2.25% by 2004. We will have another Exchequer and general Government surplus in 2002 when net current and capital spending will increase by 10.5%. That is not failure; that is success. Ten years ago such a projected figure would have been regarded as miraculous and beyond our reach.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures on personal taxation. The Government has transformed the tax code and people now get to keep, and spend, more of the money they earn. That is an increase in personal freedom for the ordinary citizen. The business taxation measures have been broadly welcomed by the business community. I say to those who would quibble with some of them that the business community has benefited enormously from the positive environment created by the Government. It, too, has a responsibility to make a contribution to society. Indirect taxation increases have been modest, while the measures on housing are most welcome in that they should <Col N="357" /> encourage people back into the private rented accommodation market, thereby taking the heat out of the rising rental market. That is vitally important because one can hardly find a house to rent in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The further large increases in children's allowance will be welcomed by mothers everywhere. Agriculture does not feature prominently in the budget, which is a reflection of the fact that we are now a predominantly industrial society. However, I welcome the capital gains tax measures relating to compensation for farmers for the compulsory purchase of their lands for road construction. These measures, taken together with the recent deal with the IFA on the matter, should go a long way towards securing acceptance and a smooth progression of our vital national road programme.</P>
    <P>The various social welfare increases in the budget will be warmly welcomed by their recipients, whom they will benefit almost immediately. The detail has already been well covered by my colleagues in the debate, but what will benefit all our people in years to come will be the reinforcement of capital spending in the national development plan announced this week. These additional moneys will improve the job prospects and quality of life of this and future generations.</P>
    <P>This is a prudent and far-sighted budget which builds on the Government's success and provides for ongoing prosperity for the people. As Deputy Lenihan said, if it is not broken, do not fix it. The Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on this budget.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to continue my contribution to the debate on the Road Traffic Bill, 2001. I had highlighted the role local authorities play in terms of road safety and, in particular, outlined the plans brought forward by Dublin Corporation. Dublin Corporation has a road safety plan in place, which I commend, but I have to question one aspect of its activities in relation to quality bus corridors and cycle routes and, in particular, the design of the new bus lanes. I have experience of the Malahide Road quality bus corridor and cycle route, on which the design of some of the junctions is positively dangerous. Without being too parochial, I highlight, in particular, the Malahide Road and Collins Avenue and Malahide Road and Fairview junctions. What safety audits are carried out by the local authority when it designs such schemes? They are dangerous and need to be examined and rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor quality of our national, non-national and urban roads is a major contributory factor to <Col N="358" /> traffic accidents. North County Dublin, for example &ndash; I am sure this applies in every other county &ndash; is bursting at the seams from a traffic point of view. Country lanes carry huge volumes of traffic, both cars and trucks. These roads were not built for this volume of traffic. Their junctions are saturated, there are no facilities for pedestrians either walking along or crossing them, they are poorly lit, surfaces are poor and there is little or no signage. Because of these poor conditions, accidents will happen as surely as night follows day. Let us take the case of a motorist travelling in the countryside on a poor road behind a truck for 20 minutes. Eventually, he or she will more than likely take a chance and overtake the truck thus increasing the risk of an accident.</P>
    <P>Raising the quality of our roads to improve road safety must be a top priority. Everything else is secondary. We have heard much in this debate about measures which could improve road safety and we have heard a great deal from the Minister. His Department has been sending out signals that it is re-examining the issue of the use of mobile phones behind the wheel. These are all reasonable propositions, but we need to get the basics right. Adequate funding must be provided to ensure all our roads, national, non-national and urban, are in a satisfactory condition and motorists can travel them safely. The Government can do something about this instead of introducing all sorts of bans and demands. Surely the job of the Department of the Environment and Local Government is, first and foremost, to provide safe roads through the local authorities. Much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>As regards some of the secondary issues I will deal, in particular, with the general safety of cars. I welcome the introduction of the national car test. While it has been painful for many motorists, cars must be safe. Road traffic safety will improve if cars are travelling efficiently and are well maintained. However, it is difficult to get an appointment in a car testing centre, particularly in the Dublin area. The Government should look carefully at establishing far more test centres for the convenience of the public.</P>
    <P>I also wish to highlight the role of the media in road safety awareness. It has had a positive influence. Although the media occasionally hypes issues before quickly dropping them, it has been to the forefront in highlighting road safety and bringing about changes in behaviour. Everyone in society welcomes its role in that regard.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to and welcome the fact that the Bill reassigns responsibility for the control of taxi stands and bus stops from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities. Local authorities are responsible for this activity at any rate. The devolution of powers from central Government to local government is always a good thing.</P>
    <P>Enforcement is a central issue. I hope we have deployed enough gardaí to deal with enforcement of road and traffic laws and that the laws on drinking and driving, for example, are not only <Col N="359" /> enforced at Christmas time. I understand why it is hyped up at Christmas, but it must be enforced throughout the year. The requirement for cyclists to have a lamp on their bikes is flouted daily and much more enforcement is needed.</P>
    <P>There has been a major change in attitudes to drinking and driving. Young people, in particular, are at the forefront in bringing about this change. Tolerance of drinking and driving has decreased substantially. The &ldquo;one for the road&rdquo; mentality is no longer accepted, which is welcome and gives hope for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the highest road traffic fatality rate in the European Union. I welcome and support any new measures which attempt to deal with the problem. Unfortunately, many measures, which might have been included in the Bill, are missing. Nevertheless, I welcome it as far as it goes.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to an interview on &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; during the week in which the guest, who had written a book related to good manners and bad manners through the ages, traced attitudes through the ages to such things as dress, eating and drinking and general habits. He pointed out how long it took people to adapt and learn the rudiments and fundamentals of, for instance, toilet habits, having excused himself for raising the matter.</P>
      <P>During the interview, it struck me that perhaps the way in which we behave on the roads &ndash; the programme made a slight reference to it &ndash; including the bad manners which characterise the behaviour of so many pedestrians and drivers, is a relatively new phenomenon. I wonder how long it will take us to get to grips with these changed conditions. How long, for example, will it take us to learn to control road rage, which is also a new phenomenon? As we become accustomed to the new traffic conditions, I presume, we will learn to control road rage. We have all heard the phrase, coined, I believe, by Seamus Mallon, &ldquo;Sunningdale for slow learners&rdquo;. Maybe we are proceeding towards a road code for slow learners. I hope it does not take too long.</P>
      <P>Listening to Members criticising the driving habits and behaviour they have observed on the roads and in car parks, I could not help thinking that we could take some of these criticisms to heart by looking more carefully at the car park in front of this building and taking note of the number of cars parked astride the lines, needlessly taking up other spaces. A Cheann-Comhairle, if you have the opportunity, take a look at how often this happens and how many spaces are badly used. We should give a lead on the matter. Some of the cars out there are not parked at all, they are abandoned. I hope, by drawing attention to this matter, I will help some people to be more careful about how they park in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many accidents are attributed to drunk drivers, and rightly so. How many are caused by young inexperienced drivers? Statistics indicate how <Col N="360" /> many accidents are caused by speeding. While there are many statistics on road traffic accidents, I am not aware of any on how many accidents are caused by badly designed roads.</P>
    <P>There are many designated accident blackspots on our roads. When I lived in the North I used to approve of these signs because they did not exist north of the Border. However, roads along which one travelled ten or 15 years ago still have the same signs indicating accident blackspots. That suggests we are not taking these blackspots as seriously as we ought, otherwise they would be remedied.</P>
    <P>We are not told how many accidents are caused by the wrong camber on a road. How many times on a comparatively new road or on a new road does one approach what appears to be a slight corner and suddenly one finds the car being pulled to the wrong side of the road? The car drifts towards the other side of the road because the camber of the road is not correct.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics to indicate how many accidents are caused by the wrong speed limitations on particular stretches of road. There may be a speed limit of 50 miles per hour where that is clearly too low for the section of road concerned, or there may be a limit of 40 or 50 miles per hour where it is clearly too high. I am continually amazed at the unpredictable nature of these speed restrictions.</P>
    <P>How many accidents are caused by frustration as a result of too many traffic lights on certain sections of road where there appears to be no justification for them? Let me give an example of a road on which I travel at least twice a day, the N4 or Lucan by-pass. Travelling from County Kildare to Dublin one must cross the county boundary. When one crosses the county boundary the speed limit is 70 miles per hour, it then changes to 50 miles per hour, to 40 miles per hour, to 50 miles per hour, to 40 miles per hour and to 30 miles per hour within a distance of eight miles. It is very confusing for people who are not used to that stretch of road. It is also confusing for those of us who are used to the section of road. It is frustrating for people travelling on the main road to the west, from Dublin to Galway, to have a speed limit of 50 miles per hour on a good section of road coming out from Kilmainham and then find there are traffic lights when they arrive at Palmerstown. The engineers who designed the road must have had a bad weekend when that section was being planned. It has been a source of frustration and anger to people since. There is no reason for having traffic lights in that position; an over-pass or an under-pass should have been built on that stretch of road. One then arrives at the M50 roundabout, another one of our roundabouts with traffic lights. Who designed these roundabouts? The idea of roundabouts is to eliminate the need for traffic lights. Very few countries have roundabouts similar to the one at the junction of the M50. This is frustrating for drivers. It makes one wonder about the engineering geniuses who were responsible for designing <Col N="361" /> some of these roads. I listened to Deputy Haughey emphasise that money should be spent on good roads, with which I agree. However, if we are to build good roads we must think of the other aspects to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The use of mobile phones while driving, which is the responsibility of another Minister, has been referred to. I have no doubt people using mobile phones while driving are responsible for a great number of accidents. There is an unanswerable case for banning the use of hand held phones while driving. It should be an offence for which there is a considerable penalty. At one time when one travelled behind a car that was swerving on the road one would say, &ldquo;that fellow has got a wee bit more drink that he ought to have had.&rdquo;  Invariably nowadays if one notices a car swerving, it is because the driver is using a hand held phone. Drivers cannot have proper control over vehicles while holding a telephone conversation. God only knows what bad news or good news that person is receiving over the phone which will distract him or her from the immediate task in hand, while trying to drive with one hand on the steering wheel. I ask the Minister of State to encourage either the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make the use of mobile phones while driving an offence.</P>
    <P>It is inexplicable that people who have proved themselves incapable of driving because they have not passed the test are allowed to drive on the roads. This does not happen in any other country in the world. There is no reason that should be the case. Any Minister or Administration who is concerned about the carnage on the roads should have done something about it. It should never have been allowed. If this happened in a Third World country people would say, strange things happen in these countries, there is inefficiency and they do not realise what they are doing but that there are not many cars on their roads. In circumstances where driving is difficult enough for experienced drivers in this country, learner drivers should not be allowed to drive on our roads.</P>
    <P>More and more when I drive 20 or 30 miles, not to mention longer journeys, park my car and turn off the ignition, I ask myself if I had done something different or another driver had done something different on several occasions during the journey would I be still alive. That is the current reality on our roads and it is intensified by the fact that there are people on the roads who are not qualified to drive.</P>
    <P>Jaywalking is another problem. If one leaves this House and drives to the first set of traffic lights, even though the lights are green, one is stopped on several occasions by people crossing the road. People seem to pay no attention to the fact that the traffic lights are against them. If one flashes the lights at these people or indicates any annoyance or concern they will turn around and give one the two fingers because they are well <Col N="362" /> used to doing that. How many people have been prosecuted for jaywalking?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that an increased number of people are wearing safety belts. I am here today because on one occasion, shortly after I was elected to this House, I was wearing my safety belt when I was involved in an accident. When people are next stopped at traffic lights, instead of using a mobile phone, they should look around to see how many people are not wearing seat belts. How many times have we seen children standing in the car between the front seats? Usually this happens when the mother is driving, but sometimes the father is also in the car. Can one think of anything more dangerous or more irresponsible than a child standing between the two front seats? How many have been convicted of that offence? These are those who say they love their children &ndash; they do &ndash; yet one sees their little darling standing between the front seats. If the driver has to apply the brake sharply, the child will go through the windscreen. That is totally irresponsible.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a big improvement in road signage. It is not the same on country roads, where some seem to think it is a big joke to turn the signs around and have people going in the wrong direction rather like the Minister for Finance with his budget. The annoyance caused by people suddenly noticing they are going the wrong way or unable to read the signs properly is a big danger on the road.</P>
    <P>In villages like Rathfarnham which are now part of the Dublin urban area there are no signposts indicating &ldquo;This is Rathfarnham&rdquo; or the signposts are inadequate with the result that people, particularly those like me, who do not know their way around some of these areas all that well, must stick to the middle of the road looking out for clues to where they are on both sides of the road. All these contribute to dangerous driving and bad manners on the road and are matters which the Minister ought to take into consideration.</P>
    <P>The problem of deliveries to premises on street corners, particularly pubs most of which are situated on street corners, was raised in the House a number of years ago. It was strongly suggested that publicans were making enough money to make alternative arrangements and that they should not park big delivery trucks on street corners at peak hours holding up traffic and unsighting other drivers on the road. Something should be done about this. It would not take much money to rectify it. There should be by-laws which the Garda could enforce to address the problem. It is something which leads to frustration and danger on the road.</P>
    <P>There is a disproportionate number of fatal accidents on roads adjacent to the Border. Deputies from Border areas are concerned about the matter and I have heard Deputy McGahon raise it on a number of occasions. It is a fact that there are a greater number of accidents and more severe accidents on roads adjacent to the Border. <Col N="363" /> There must be some reason for this. Someone suggested to me that in Northern Ireland there is no political distinction made when people refer to the Free State, that those from republican, Nationalist or Unionist backgrounds invariably refer to this jurisdiction as the Free State and there is no political connotation in it. When the people of County Tyrone are going to County Monaghan they just say, &ldquo;I am going over to the State,&rdquo; and there is no political point being made. However, it seems that on occasion there is a &ldquo;free&rdquo; state mentality expressed by those coming over the Border to the effect that they are out of that damn place in the North. That was particularly the case before the Good Friday Agreement when there was a different sort of attitude. I myself felt it coming over the Border. Unfortunately, that or something else must contribute to the fact that there are so many accidents which are caused by Six County Ulster men and women adjacent to the Border. Will the Minister state whether the penalty points system will be part of the new co-operation, North and South? Will offences committed south of the Border be held against a person with a Northern licence and will offences committed north of the Border be held against a person with a Southern licence? I do not want to be a killjoy, but there are too many being killing on our roads. Considering the carnage, when considering this Bill we must examine every possibility of reducing it. It is in that context that I ask the Minister to look at some of the suggestions I have made. I have done my best not to repeat points made by other speakers and hope the Minister will think that at least some of my points are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which deserves the attention of everybody in the House. The Government's campaign to reduce the number of deaths and driving offences on our roads has been under way since the launch of the national roads strategy in 1998. That strategy has already resulted in a 12% reduction in the number of road deaths since 1997 and a 25% reduction in serious injuries.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows the Government to step its campaign up a gear and paves the way for the introduction of the penalty points system, a key component of the national roads strategy. Opposition claims that the system has been stalled due to lack of resources are a prime example of a misunderstanding of the complexities and procedures involved in bringing it to fruition. Significant preparatory work has been carried out to ensure the proposed system is both effective and foolproof. The Government accepts that there is a need to be very careful regarding the formulation of the legislation regarding the system to ensure it will be constitutionally solid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures are under way to link together related databases such as the Garda information technology system PULSE, the Department of the Environment and Local Government national <Col N="364" /> driver file, located in Shannon, and the local authority records of licences issued as well as those of the courts system. This will need to work efficiently in order for points to be awarded. It is a massive software task on which work is proceeding with a significant chunk already completed.</P>
    <P>Tenders were sought by the Garda in May this year for the development and implementation of the national fixed charges processing system within the PULSE computer system and a general PULSE central records achieving system area. I understand the tenders have been received and are being evaluated. It is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly and the system will be ready for testing by mid-2002 and in operation by the end of that year.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system, however, is only one element of the Bill. Overall, the proposals in the Bill will play a key role in ensuring the Government achieves the target set out in the road safety strategy of reducing by 25% the number of fatal accidents occurring between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., which are commonly drink related.</P>
    <P>Almost 10,500 detections for drink driving offences were made by the Garda in the year 2000. Drink driving, despite the perception and reality of stricter enforcement and changed social attitudes, remains a major road safety problem. There has been a perception in recent years that we have somehow overcome the problem. Unfortunately this is not the case. Whereas there has been a sea change in social attitudes to drinking and driving, it still remains a major road safety problem. Over 10,000 detections for drink driving offences were made by the Garda in 2000, an increase of one quarter on the 1998 figure. Some 92% of blood and urine specimens and 82% of breath specimens analysed in 2000 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were above the permitted alcohol level for driving, while 61% of blood and urine results and 33% of breath results were more than twice the legal limit. There were 9,532 arrests for drinking driving offences by the end of September this year. The Road Traffic Bill proposes to extend the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide an evidential breath specimen to include situations where a driver is involved in a road accident or where the garda considers a road traffic offence was committed. This is in addition to the present grounds where a garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol. The increased levels of enforcement which the Garda put in place, advertising campaigns such as those of the National Safety Council and the proposed move to selective random breath testing strengthen the fight against drink driving. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, stated that he has an open mind on introducing new legislation to extend breath testing, which I welcome. He said he will take into account the views expressed during this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> The national road safety strategy also provides for the increased operation of evidential breath testing and increasing the number of sites to carry out such tests. At the end of 1999, four evidential breath testing sites came into operation, which was increased to 25 in 2000. Thirty two Garda stations now have evidential breath testing capabilities and that will increase to 40 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government is pulling its weight to reduce the number of road deaths and to ensure the rules of the road are strictly enforced. The Opposition should be advised that additional mobile detection units, or GATSO vans, have been in operation countrywide under the Government's road safety strategy to clamp down on excessive speeding. Six vans are currently in operation and the Garda was issued with another 188 laser guns in 2000. A total of 34 in-car camera systems and two unmarked motorcycles with in-built cameras are currently in use.</P>
    <P>A pilot project of fixed speed cameras was introduced on the N1 in Louth, Meath and Dublin. This new system will significantly increase the rate of detection of excess speeding. At present, there are fixed speed cameras on the N2, the N3, the N4 and the M50 with plans for an aggressive extension of them nationwide. The national road strategy has succeeded in reducing the number of road fatalities by 12% at a time when the number of motorists continues to increase. Allied to that is a 25% reduction in the number of serious injuries as a result of road accidents. More than 224,000 on the spot fines were issued last year compared to 179,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. The number of these fines issued in 2001 shows a further increase and today stands at 253,000. Also, 48,000 on the spot fines were issued for failing to wear a seatbelt.</P>
    <P>We have also seen two resource packs for both primary and secondary schools, the introduction of the national car test and the driver theory test in June 2001. This test provides a supplement to the long-standing practical test and will encourage a deeper and more structured understanding by novice drivers of information and behaviour which will help them become safer drivers. Positive action is being taken by the Government, the Garda and all agencies responsible for road safety promotion to reduce injury and death on the roads.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Currie about people not parking properly in car parks, including those of Leinster House. There is nothing more disgusting than to drive into a hospital car park and find that one car is occupying two spaces by parking across the line. Another problem is drivers taking up spaces allocated for people with disabilities in hospital grounds, local authority yards and particularly at supermarkets. Recently, in my local supermarket I questioned a woman, in a car with three children, who took up one of two disabled spaces even though there were about 200 other spaces <Col N="366" /> available. I will not repeat what she said to me. People have no respect for these spaces.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey made a valid point about the use of country roads by people to avoid towns and villages. Limerick Corporation and County Council have a good network of roads, which has improved in recent years. The road from Adare to Annacotty will mean people can avoid the city. At present, to avoid going through the city, drivers go through the Raheen industrial estate and other areas in the morning. It causes major problems to people in these areas, particularly where there are national schools. Parents have to cope with a huge volume of traffic when they take their children to school because, to save a few minutes, cars avoid the main road into Limerick.</P>
    <P>I also agree with what Deputy Currie said about the use of mobile phones. Many people use them while driving even though hands-free sets are available to avoid this. There are so many people who appear to be using mobile phones that I often think they must be talking to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Government's primary focus in updating this legislation is the safe usage of the roads network. I am sure there is no Member of the Oireachtas who does not have a close family member or friend who has lost his or her life prematurely through road death. I lost two good friends in traffic accidents in recent years. It is a horrific experience which one tries to figure out and to explain. We should use this legislation to ensure that fewer people lose their lives on the roads.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons people die on our roads. In recent years the increase in the number of cars on our roads has led to congestion in rural areas as well as in major urban areas. In tandem with the legislation, every citizen must pay more attention to road safety. We all know the advertisements on television and radio which portray the carnage. At the funeral of a friend who died in an accident, someone commented that it gives us a sense of perspective. It does for about 30 seconds as people quickly move on.</P>
      <P>Many speakers mentioned mobile phones. Public representatives are probably among the biggest culprits as we are constantly on the phone. How many calls do those of us who drive from Cork to Dublin or from Dublin to Cork make during the journey? Hands-free sets are available, but drivers seem to prefer using the phone up to the ear. We must ensure they use hands-free sets. They should be encouraged to switch off the phone to avoid distractions while driving. I acknowledge that some second level schools provide instruction in driving practice and driver education. Good driving practice and consideration for other road users should be taught to young people in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phenomenon of road rage is now being dealt with in the courts. Everybody is in a hurry on our roads. A queue of traffic will irritate some<Col N="367" /> one under pressure of time. Road rage is not the answer and should be condemned outright.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the large number of infrastructural projects being put in place. I note that over the past year and a half there have been many objections in all constituencies to the development of the road network. While many towns and villages need new roads, people object to plans for new major roads in their locality. The argument is often made that they managed for years without a new road and they do not want one now. There was huge investment in national infrastructure during the 1920s and 1930s. This must be continued. If we are serious about road safety, we must provide the necessary infrastructure for safer driving.</P>
    <P>A penalty points system is proposed in the Bill. It will take a couple of years for people to see the full benefit of this legislation once they have become accustomed to the new regulations. The national car test introduced two years ago is a very worthwhile initiative. We are all aware of the number of accidents that took place because of the number of faulty cars with defective brakes and lights being used on our roads. The NCT is, therefore, very important. We must ensure that, if we have a proper road network, drivers abide by strict laws such as those proposed in this legislation and that vehicles are up to standard.</P>
    <P>The driver theory test is vital. We all learned the rules of the road before taking the driving test, but the new system ensures drivers will know them better. They will have to learn them well enough to complete a written test. I suggest that a refresher course should be considered for all drivers.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputies Haughey, Currie and Wade on the issue of disabled drivers' parking spaces which are being misused by able bodied drivers. It is deplorable to see this happen in hospital car parks. The fines cannot be large enough for this offence. Parking spaces for disabled drivers are designated for those less mobile than the rest of the population. We should show leadership by pointing out to anyone who misuses a disabled driver's parking space that these spaces are provided for the exclusive use of people with disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate and broadly welcome the Bill which deals with one of the most important issues to come before the House in recent years. As other Deputies have said, we are all alarmed at the spiralling number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on our roads. One message that should come from the House is that all these accidents could have been prevented. Accidents do not occur for no reason and are not outside anyone's control. They occur because of bad practice. There have been bad habits within the driving population for too long. Accidents ultimately occur because drivers are not abiding by the rules of the road. It is essential that we put in place a <Col N="368" /> modern system of deterrents to ensure those who break the rules of the road are stopped and penalised.</P>
      <P>My only source of disagreement with the Government is the length of time it has taken to have the Bill published and enacted. I am aware that the Minister did tremendous work in putting together the 1998 national roads strategy which included an indicative timeframe for the publication of the Bill. It is an indicative feature of our parliamentary democracy that, virtually four years after that document was published, we are only now debating this major legislation which is absolutely central to modernisation of the law. I do not wish to be churlish in making that point, but rather observe that parliamentary democracy moves very slowly. We should look to introduce a system whereby we could fast-track legislation which did not happen in this case. That was a mistake. The sooner this legislation is implemented the better.</P>
      <P>Visitors to this country all comment upon bad driving practice in this country. Young male drivers, in particular, do not abide by the rules of the road. This is a new phenomenon because many younger men now have access to cars compared to 15 or 20 years ago. I live in a large housing estate in Dublin which contains 1,600 houses. Young lads of 17 and 18 years of age fly around the roads. They have no notion of how to drive. Many of them are using their parents' cars. They have provisional driving licences. The lack of Garda resources means that they are not being stopped and held accountable for their actions. Deputy Moynihan spoke about the problems on our county roads. The problem also extends to the housing estates of urban Ireland where it can be even worse. Many bad accidents occur in housing estates. The problem relates to young men and may be due to whatever hormones affect them. I am just out of that age bracket.</P>
      <P>One way to confront this problem is by normalising the procedure of driving. Driving should be on the secondary school curriculum. Men are obsessed with driving. The same is not true of women who are much better drivers. Boys in particular who reach the age of 12 or 13 should formally be taught how to drive properly. By 17 or 18 most of them are on the roads causing havoc. I know that is not central to this legislation, but the Minister should work with the Minister for Education and Science to put this on the curriculum and thereby prevent more accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the penalty points system working very effectively in other jurisdictions. The Minister has outlined his logic for reducing the penalty points on payment of a fine. It is ridiculous that, having committed an offence on the roads for which penalty points are allocated, if someone is prepared to pay money, those points are either reduced by half or eliminated altogether. This means that wealthy people who can afford to pay £50 or £100 on the spot, will continue to pay because they know they can get away with it. If they have not amassed 12 points in a three-year <Col N="369" /> period, they are free for a further three years. This is a defect in the legislation which should be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On page 35, the First Schedule to the Bill shows different classifications of offences. However I take issue with some of the penalty points allocated to offences. I am in favour of the principle of the legislation, but it is important that we get it right. People caught driving without a licence will receive two penalty points if they pay and five points if they do not pay. However people who pay having been caught for careless driving, which I believe to be a much more serious offence, will receive no penalty points. A wealthy person in his BMW or black Mercedes could continually drive carelessly, flout the law, pay up whenever caught and get away with it. However a poor person who may not be able to afford an on the spot fine, gets five points. We may need to return to this on Committee Stage. The Minister seems to suggest that in order to ensure greater compliance a monetary device is required. However this means wealthier people will be able to continually flout the law and get away with it. We need a mechanism to stop this.</P>
    <P>One of the offences is a breach of duties on occurrences of accidents. People charged with passing by an accident or not showing deference to a garda at an accident may get five points, but will get no points if they pay up. We need to return to this on Committee Stage because it could be a defective part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have a question about the three-year period. I may be two years and 11 months into my category of time and have accumulated 11 points. However when the three years are up, I go back to zero. We should have a buffer zone before and after the three years. That too should also be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Where will the money that accrues from this go? It is a feature of most modern legislation where we raise money, as we will under these charges, that we designate where the money will go. In my cursory reading of the Bill, I have not seen what the Minister is proposing. The money should go to a dedicated fund so that we know how much money is being raised and this can then be used for improving conditions for motorists. We should specify how this money will be spent.</P>
    <P>There should be no time lag between the enactment of this legislation and the operation of the penalty points system. From my reading of the legislation this is dependent on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government making regulations. It would be a crying shame if we enact the legislation but the system did not become operational for a further 12 or 14 months.</P>
    <P>Section 9 transposes into Irish law disqualifications under the European Convention on Driving Disqualifications. If an Irish national commits a serious road offence in another country it is wholly right and appropriate for that to have an effect in the jurisdiction in which he resides. Equally if someone from France or Germany <Col N="370" /> commits a serious offence on our roads, they should be penalised in their country. I welcome that. However, this convention relates to serious offences and not to minor offences.</P>
    <P>I now take up a theme mentioned by Deputy Currie relating to the North-South aspect of penalty points. Friends of mine in Northern Ireland have been obliged to take full cognisance of the equivalent legislation there for some time. A friend in Newcastle, County Down, recently told me she had four penalty points because of speeding offences between Belfast and Newcastle. I asked her if she were to drive to Dublin and exceeded the speed limit in this jurisdiction would the penalty points be added on. From my reading of the legislation, that will not apply. If that is the case it is a major defect. We need an all-Ireland approach to road safety and to the application of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>In November 2000 when I was Northern Ireland spokesperson for my party, I issued a specific statement about this. I asked a number of questions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He could not answer me. I asked him to state the number of drivers from Northern Ireland who were prosecuted for speeding on southern roads. I also asked the Minister to set out the procedure that is followed in pursuing people for offences of this nature who live outside our jurisdiction. There is none. For someone using our roads on a regular basis, whether travelling from Belfast or other parts of Northern Ireland to the Republic, we cannot stop them if they are involved in minor offences, as opposed to serious offences. It is essential we close off that loophole in the legislation. Has the Minister negotiated a specific protocol with his opposite colleague in the Northern Ireland Executive?</P>
    <P>Under the transport annex to the section of the Good Friday Agreement which relates to North-South co-operation there is a provision to ensure an all-Ireland approach to this issue. Under the Bill someone from Belfast who does business in Dublin can travel regularly to Dublin and speed on the N1, which is the most dangerous road in Ireland in terms of the number of deaths, but the penalty points they would get in this jurisdiction cannot be transferred to Northern Ireland. If my reading of the Bill is correct &ndash; I believe it is &ndash; that is a major defect. It is equally wrong that people who reside in this jurisdiction are allowed to break the rules of the road in Northern Ireland without having penalty points imposed here. I ask the Minister to consider that. If it requires a specific protocol with his opposite number in the Northern Ireland Executive, which I suspect it will, we should have more time between Second and Committee Stages because we need to close that loophole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie is right that the number of accidents and deaths on the road between Belfast and Dublin is higher than on any other stretch of road. I suspect one of the reasons for that is that drivers know they will get away with it. They know they can speed and be careless and reckless <Col N="371" /> on the road and even if they are caught by gardaí, the penalty points cannot be transferred to Northern Ireland and<i> vice versa</i>. This is not a free state disposition, but a matter of fact. It is important for the Minister to analyse this issue to see if it is possible between now and passage of the legislation to work out a new protocol with his opposite number in Northern Ireland. This is an all-Ireland issue. If ever there was an issue we needed to address in terms of the unification of the country, it is the issue of road safety policy on the island. Bad practice in Newry is the same as that in Dundalk and we must stamp it out. One of the ways we can do that is to ensure that, as part of the legislation, Northern drivers who do not abide by the rules of the road in this jurisdiction have their penalty points transferred to Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>I want to make a number of helpful suggestions to the Minister. I know we have debated the issue of provisional drivers before. I hold the view that a person should not be entitled to drive on our roads if he or she holds a provisional licence. I know the rules which apply in relation to a person on his or her first provisional licence, but it is bad practice. I do not know of any other EU country where someone who has not qualified through the system is entitled to drive unaccompanied. This loophole needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to consider prohibiting cars which can reach speeds of up to 100 or 150 miles per hour. Why do we allow cars to be imported as goods to be sold if they can reach such speeds? If we allow such cars to be sold, we should ensure they have an alarm mechanism. If one does not wear a seat belt in a Volvo car, for example, a large red light will flash and an annoying noise will be heard until the person puts on the seat belt. We need the same type of device for cars which exceed the speed limit in this jurisdiction. I am interested to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>My party, through its spokesperson at the time, Deputy Naughten, made an excellent suggestion that, if young men took a more difficult form of the driving test, they would be able to get cheaper car insurance. I ask the Minister to consider that. Hazard perception training has worked well in Scotland. Once a person does the training, they are prescribed to be a safer driver on the basis that they have taken a more arduous test than the normal one. Drivers who take those tests should be given a premium by insurance companies. I know one company is considering that.</P>
    <P>Large signs advertising a freefone number should be erected on our roads, particularly on the routes linking the major cities, such as the Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Galway and Cork to Galway roads, to enable people to ring the Garda and report immediately when a car is flouting the rules of the road. We all know of and are frus<Col N="372" /> trated by lunatic drivers who zigzag in and out of traffic and we are not able to ring the Garda directly and report it to them. I know reporting is not part of our psyche &ndash; it goes back to the foundation of the State. One of the benefits of having a mobile phone in a car is that one can report someone if he or she is flouting the law. We need large advertising hoardings on our main thoroughfares to enable us to directly report people who breach the rules of the road. We meet these people every day.</P>
    <P>My comments are an attempt to be constructive. I wish the Minister well with the legislation, which is long overdue. The sooner we have proper deterrents, the sooner we will be able to stamp out bad practice and bad motoring skills which have, unfortunately, been allowed to develop through the generations. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on the points I made during my contribution.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The House has not debated such an important issue for society since the national foot and mouth disease crisis earlier this year. Road safety has always been my priority policy and a debate on legislation to improve Ireland's road safety record is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>As a rural Member of the House from Cork East, I must travel 137 miles from Mitchelstown to the Dáil and back again each week. Since 1982 I have seen countless road accidents on this weekly trip. Young people are killed or maimed for life and families are permanently devastated. Unfortunately, young men are usually the victims and also the perpetrators of these accidents. As we talk in this Chamber, road users are dying. It is time to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill we, as public representatives, must be self-confident enough to acknowledge that there is no such thing as Government or Opposition Deputies. We all have an obligation to support the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in what is being done to tackle our poor road safety record. Furthermore, we all have a duty to constructively comment to the Minister on what needs to be done in the future to improve road safety. We know the Government has a commitment to road safety. The Taoiseach launched a high level group on road safety in 1998 which is made up of representatives of the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Garda Síochána, the National Safety Council, the National Roads <Col N="373" /> Authority and the Medical Bureau for Road Safety. In order to manage a responsible road safety policy the group established targets under the heading &ldquo;road to safety, Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002.&rdquo;  Thus, for the first time targets were set in the area of road safety to reduce deaths, accidents and speed and increase seat belt wearing. The setting of policy targets was not only an exercise in political accountability, many of these goals are on the way to being achieved. The Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and his Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, must be commended for their record to date. However, there is a culture of irresponsible motoring. This culture has only got worse during the years and until it is tackled the media will continue to report on a high frequency of carnage on our roads. Ultimately, the various players involved in road safety, outlined above, will fight a losing battle until the culture of carnage is addressed.</P>
    <P>While we debate the merits of this Bill, time is ticking and lives are being lost on our roads. Family members leave the house able-bodied and may never return, or do so as paraplegics. While effective television advertisements, which have been sponsored by the insurance industry and the National Safety Council, have attempted to shock road users into positive action, the culture of carnage persists. It is a difficult job and there is driver error. We have to be conciliatory in ways, but it is time to force road users to behave differently when they drive. The measures outlined in the Bill are, in effect, telling the irresponsible motorist that there is no more Mr. Nice Guy when it comes to irresponsible motoring behaviour. I welcome this hard-nosed approach to the issue and the measures in the Bill. Penalty points are being introduced, which will stay on a driver's record for three years and when a total of 12 are reached an automatic driving ban of six months will apply.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Hayes with interest. Small cars are able to travel much faster than the black Mercedes or the BMW.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">

      <P>I was driving to Dublin recently at 6 a.m. Near Cullahill I was passed by two Fiat Unos, which have engines of about 1 litre. I thought they were having a race. Lo and behold, as they passed me a courier van passed them and I did not know if I would have to take my car in over the ditch. That is what was happening on our roads at that hour of the morning and it was totally irresponsible. I suspect that the two in the Fiat Unos were going to work. I was not driving very fast and the incident was so alarming that I stopped my car. Big cars are often <Col N="374" /> much safer because they cannot get the speed up as fast as smaller ones.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the maximum financial penalties for traffic offences from £150 to £630, 800, and more traffic cameras are to be installed on main roads. These measures are welcome. The problems are not all to do with the road user. Driver error can often be the result of bad roads. Deputy Bradford will have complaints, as I have, about the Portlaoise bypass. The left turn off that road to go to Cork is very badly signposted. After nine years the Cork section of that road has not been completed and features bollards which are impediments to drivers. The signpost is for Cork, Tullamore and Portlaoise. Many people from Cork have complained to me that they regularly miss the turn and in frustration are inclined to slow down and even turn back. There is a role for local government in sorting this out as a matter of urgency. If one fails to make the turn, one has to continue along the motorway and cross over to Abbeyleix.</P>
      <P>There is much wrong with drivers, but at the end of the day we can do much to improve the roads. The Portlaoise bypass is a new development of the type we are seeking. I listened to Deputy Michael Moynihan talk of the opposition there can be to new roads, but here is a development that has not been completed. I am quite sure that accidents have taken place there, though I have not seen one. I am sure because of what I have been told and because of the numerous complaints I have received. Such accidents would be classed as having resulted from driver error.</P>
      <P>We are making our roads faster and our engineering leaves much to be desired from a road safety point of view, because of human nature being what it is. There are too many junctions on many of our roads. Another road that will also be well known to Deputy Bradford is the road from Mitchelstown to Fermoy, in regard to which there were many motions at roads meetings in the north Cork local authority of which I was a member and on which Deputy Bradford still sits. The number of openings and entrances onto that road is unreal. I fail to understand how, when a road is being realigned and re-engineered, the side roads and cul-de-sacs onto it cannot be combined. I have seen experiments done in Scotland where they were all brought onto one side road, which is one way of alleviating the problem. The level of deaths on that road is exceptionally high as is the number who have been physically handicapped and will not walk again. The roadside is like a graveyard with little headstones and plaques identifying those whose deaths have taken place. It makes me quite sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not overly-sympathetic to young drivers as regards the high cost of their insurance. The high insurance cost is a deterrent to young drivers speeding. One pays the price and if one wants value for money, one must drive accordingly with <Col N="375" /> caution. The small car with the 1 litre engine is quite a problem. When I see those cars on the road with the large wheels and the double exhaust I shudder because those speedy fellows will end up in the ditch or cause multiple deaths. I often meet the Garda to talk about these drivers and cars and I am told that there is little that can be done. These guys drive madly and the speed limit is no deterrent to them as it is to Members of the House. We obey the law. I pay tribute to the Garda traffic corps. We hear that we should have a dedicated traffic unit, but the Garda traffic corps does an excellent job. Its members are dedicated individuals who are under a lot of pressure and come in for a lot of abuse. My experience of them is that they are quite good and one could not look for much improvement on what they do. They are long and late on the road. In many cases their job is a sad one because they are called in when there is death and injury.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more unmarked Garda cars on our roads. We all know the Garda cars whether they are red, gold or green. They are easily identified from the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; on their registration plate. If Garda cars carried the county registration and there was more casual driving by gardaí, they would identify more often the carelessness of drivers. That would be better than having them sitting at prescribed points identifying speeders. Members on all sides of the House see the carelessness in people's driving, especially on a Friday, when it is shocking. People drive on the inside and zig-zag all over the place. I have witnessed it all myself and I am not being emotional or hyping up what happens.</P>
    <P>Another thing that astounds me is the overtaking by laden trucks on the road. I am sure Deputy Bradford has witnessed it as he travels the roads from Dublin to Cork. These trucks are subject to a speed limit of 50 miles per hour. When one truck is not able to get past another the two of them travel side by side, which is quite serious. I am astounded that there have been no prosecutions. Those trucks are a danger and should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Has a curfew for young drivers ever been looked at? Curfews operate in many parts of the world where the same problems are encountered. They are operated in Australia, New Zealand and Canada from perhaps 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. when most of the accidents involving young drivers occur. Most accidents occur late in the evening or early in the morning and most are on national secondary roads or main arterial roads. I believe county and regional roads, which have been mentioned, have low levels of accidents and deaths. There is a high road accident death rate and I hope we can work towards reducing that to zero.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on producing the Bill. While there is a need for a change in behaviour and attitude, I am <Col N="376" /> sympathetic to people in rural areas who drive and who also like a drink. In this regard, I compliment the Minister of State on not having reduced the blood alcohol limit from 80 mg to zero, which it is on the Continent. He will know as a rural Deputy that people in rural areas, especially those who are retired, go to the local crossroads pub for a drink. They would be walled in and it would be worse than a curfew if the limits were changed. I know those who represent and live in Dublin, such as Deputy Callely, have a different view, but those who know rural areas will know that it is not a culture and that there must be some social outlet for these people. I welcome the fact the limit has not been reduced. I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The primary focus of any Road Traffic Bill is to improve road safety. I understand the proposals in the Bill are aimed at further enhancement of road safety and that must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>On what Deputy Ned O'Keeffe had to say, although I may have been born and reared in the beautiful capital city of this country, Dublin, and am proud to represent Dublin North Central, I am familiar with rural life. I am fortunate to be able to avail of a facility in Deputies O'Keeffe and Bradford's county, Cork. The nearest town is 23 miles from me, so I know what rural life is like. I still do not agree with drinking and driving and wholly support and am proud of the advertisement on Eastern Regional Health Authority ambulances, which says: &ldquo;Never ever drink and drive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also disagree with Deputy O'Keeffe when he spoke of a curfew on young people and made other comments to that effect about them. There is one thing I can say about them which would make many of us in the House hold our heads in shame, which is that they are much more responsible than the generations which have gone before. It is not uncommon to see young people in a pub enjoying themselves in the knowledge that they have a designated driver who will only drink mineral water or something similar. Young people take great responsibility and care in road safety. It is very unfair that they are often targeted as the cause of all road accidents. Unfortunately, a high proportion of young people are involved in them, but it is too easy to jump to the conclusion that they are at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the main purpose of the Bill is the introduction of a penalty points system. He boasted that it is a feature in most countries with an advanced road safety record. However, there is an element of cherry-picking in this. Such countries also have a practical test for young people before they go on the road. I am delighted that a motion I moved at a meeting of my parliamentary party was agreed to <Col N="377" /> which asked that, given road accident statistics, consideration be given in any review of the Government road safety strategy to education, information and practical experience being incorporated in the second level school curriculum, especially given that 400,000 first time applications for provisional driving licences will be made in the next five years. I am sure if I were to cherry-pick, I would find countries with a tremendous road safety record which have a practical test for young people. It makes sense to have this practical test if there are to be 400,000 first-time provisional licence holders on the roads in the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State replied to a recent question by saying that the report, Road Accident Facts, 2000, showed that the highest number of casualties in recorded age groups occurred in the 25 to 34 age group and represented approximately 21% of the overall total for the year. A survey carried out by the Garda Síochána into the cause of fatal traffic accidents between 1997 and 1999 showed that driver error was the cause of 23% of accidents in 1997 whereas alcohol was the cause of 11% of accidents. The figure for driver error in 1998 was 20% and 22% in 1999. The figure for alcohol in 1999 was 16%.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about improving the skills of young, inexperienced drivers, especially first-time provisional licence applicants, we should improve the education side of the road safety strategy. While I appreciate that to do this on a Twenty-six County basis would have a huge cost implication, we should be committed to doing it. I have already had discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation and have spoken to one of the largest insurance companies on this. Incidentally, I appreciate the tremendous public advertisements they have put on television networks to highlight road safety.</P>
    <P>The Bill focuses on a penalty points system but I am not sure a person should be automatically disqualified after reaching 12 points in a three year period. We are pushing this a little too hard. Other areas need to be addressed first, such as road engineering and speed limit zones, for example, where there is a 30 mile per hour zone where there should not be. A lovely gentleman attended my clinic this morning. He was touching 70 years of age and had been driving accident free all his life. He brought to my attention that he had to pay a £50 speeding fine for the first time because he was caught on camera speeding in a 30 mile per hour zone. Both he and I agreed that zone should not have such a limit. There are issues of this nature which will become more apparent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation. It is a debate to which many Members wish to contribute. Those speakers to whom I listened during the <Col N="378" /> debate have made interesting and valid points and I am sure the Minister will learn much from what has been said.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was published, road accidents have continued unabated. It is a national tragedy that so many people, particularly the young, are being killed in road accidents. Any legislation which will improve road safety and, thus, reduce loss of life on the roads must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Bad drivers, poor roads, defective cars and bad signposting all contribute to the difficulties that road users face every day. The legislation, including the concept of penalty points which has worked well elsewhere, is a step in the right direction. I accept that a modification of the penalty points system should be considered once it is in place and working. If it does impress on drivers the need to be constantly vigilant, it will be welcome. If such a system can reduce the amount of time being spent on administration by court and Garda officials in sorting out minor traffic offences, so much the better. While a penalty points system may help to reduce road accidents, it is only one of many steps that will have to be taken if we are to address the current large scale problem.</P>
      <P>The statistics can be quite frightening but we must concede that there have never before been so many people driving on the roads. Given that fact, it was inevitable that the number of accidents would increase. There are many lessons to be learned concerning road safety. I agree with Deputy Kenneally that this subject needs to be part of the school curriculum. This matter has been raised previously and is currently being examined by the Minister. One can never learn good driving skills early enough.</P>
      <P>A large number of drivers could, unfortunately, be termed bad or even dangerous. On many occasions, the Minister has referred to the driving test system which requires urgent review. It is worrying that someone who has held a provisional driving licence for just a day is free to drive on the roads with no experience and no full licence holder accompanying them. That situation is problematic because many accidents are caused by drivers who hold only provisional licences. That issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also examine the system of driving instruction. An attempt has been made to introduce regulation of driving instructors and I am sure the vast majority of instructors would welcome such a system. They would also welcome the possibility of belonging to an affiliated group of registered driving instructors. The Minister needs to take that necessary step. We should examine what passes as a driving test, even though recent changes have included the introduction of a theoretical element. It strikes me as odd that annual statistics for driving test results show an almost constant 50% failure rate. One might ask whether driving instruction methods, or driving skills, have improved to any degree if the failure rate is so high among first time applicants <Col N="379" /> year after year. On previous occasions in the House, I have expressed my dissatisfaction with the driving test system which should be reviewed because it is not working. Any system that produces a failure rate of 50% needs to be reviewed if we want to improve the quality of driving on the roads.</P>
    <P>The quality of our roads also needs to be examined and, in particular, the quality of national primary routes. Dangerous junctions, bad signposting and bad lighting all contribute to accidents. Accident blackspots are listed as such, but they have remained unchanged for a generation. Whether this is due to lack of funding, lack of political will or a lack of direction, either from the Department or local authorities, these blackspots have caused numerous accidents, many of them fatal, over the years. Bad roads should not be accepted in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Many county roads are narrow and have poor surfaces, but I am also talking about poor safety conditions on national primary routes. I travel most frequently on the main Cork-Dublin road which has blackspots, yet they are not receiving the remedial attention they require and that is entirely unacceptable. A small amount of money is made available by local authorities &ndash; although not, unfortunately, on an annual basis &ndash; to deal with accident blackspots. The Minister should give serious consideration to these issues.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable for road accidents to occur as a result of insufficient public lighting, bad signposting or dangerous markings at junctions. On a number of occasions I have overshot the runway, so to speak, at the Cork exit on the Portlaoise by-pass. The markings on that turn-off are inadequate and inappropriate. While it may be the responsibility of the National Roads Authority, it is such an obvious failure that I am amazed it has not been remedied, particularly as the bypass has been operational for quite a number of years. This sort of slow reaction at all levels is causing problems. A simple issue such as that, where a junction is not adequately signposted, should be resolved within weeks, yet the problem to which I referred has remained unresolved for five or six years. It is disappointing that nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister about road signposting. It is time for us to examine the type of signposting we have been using for two generations. Most of our &ldquo;Yield&rdquo;, &ldquo;Slow&rdquo; or speed limit signs are being totally ignored by drivers. While some drivers are irresponsible, in many cases it is a question of familiarity breeding contempt. More dramatic signposting is needed. The Minister should examine new designs for road signs because what might have been all right 30 or 40 years ago &ndash; when people pottered along in Ford Anglias and Prefects at 30 or 40 miles per hour &ndash; is not sufficient today. We have moved on from that and we need to move on in regard to signposting. It is not a question of rocket science to put new and <Col N="380" /> more dramatic signposting in place because the current signposting is ineffective.</P>
    <P>We concede that speed limits are ignored by too many people. Many county roads where the national speed limit applies and where, in theory, people can drive at 50 miles per hour and 55 miles per hour, are not fit to carry traffic travelling at that speed. On some of the country roads where accidents have occurred and where there is much agricultural traffic, particularly heavy lorries, it is unsafe for motorists to travel on those roads at 45 or 50 miles per hour. We need to make progress in regard to speed limits on many of those roads.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if full documentation is available on the number of road accidents which occur on county roads. If that record was maintained either in local authorities or in Garda stations we would be able to look at county roads where there is an ongoing problem with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to cars travelling too fast and to high-powered cars as being, in many cases, a danger. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe made the opposite point that some of the more dangerous cars are the small, one litre engine cars which can go from nought to 65 miles per hour in a few seconds and are generally driven very fast by young people.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the physical condition of many of the cars travelling today. Admittedly, as a result of the scrappage scheme introduced in recent years and the NCT the quality of the car is better and safer but not as good as it should be. The regulations in regard to car safety should be monitored. Car accidents arising from defective cars are a double tragedy because they could have been prevented.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the Minister is empowered to look at issues such as emissions and various issues which deal with the environmental side of motoring. Given that this is budget week, I was disappointed the Minister and the Minister of State were not successful in getting the Minister for Finance to introduce some incentives to make greener motoring more attractive. In regard to LPG, which is a cleaner fuel, we should have tried to put some incentive in place. New types of engines are being developed by a number of companies such as Toyota. Further incentives should be provided to promote the use of that type of car because the level of emission from the hundreds of thousands of cars travelling Irish roads every day is a cause for environmental concern. Additional budgetary measures should be introduced in the Finance Bill to make cleaner motoring more attractive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. None of us wishes to be spoilsports, but we must have strong legislation in place to promote road safety and improve driving standards on Irish roads. Too many lives have been lost. Too many families have been devastated in cases where accidents should not have happened. This legislation plus <Col N="381" /> many other measures, if introduced, can turn the tide.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his ongoing efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides for their positive and constructive contributions to an open and interesting debate on this subject. I am particularly happy to note that 30 Deputies contributed to the debate and that there is general welcome for this important and innovative legislation which will directly influence the safety of all road users. I listened with great care to the many thoughtful contributions which we have had over the four days of the Second Stage debate and I will endeavour to respond as positively and constructively as possible.</P>
      <P>In the time available to me it will only be possible to address the main themes of the debate. However, the forthcoming Committee Stage debate will afford the opportunity to give detailed consideration to the specific issues in the legislation as many points have been raised here. I am please there is, in general, agreement on the proposal to introduce the penalty points system. There was only one voice demurring from that position. There is also agreement on the need to continually support and enhance the enforcement of our road traffic laws.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised by Deputies in relation to the proposed system which will be, I am sure, the subject of detailed consideration during Committee Stage. There have been suggestions that there was undue delay in bringing this Bill forward. That is a constant theme from Opposition parties. Most of the criticism centres on the penalty points system. Deputy Gilmore, whose overall support for the Bill I welcome, made particular reference to this point and stated incorrectly that the system was copied from other states.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that contention and I reiterate that the design of the penalty points system provided for in the Bill has been the subject of careful and detailed consideration. This was necessitated by the overriding need to ensure that the penalty points system will operate successfully within the overall administration and enforcement of road traffic law and against the background of the constitutional provisions, unique to us here, which apply to offences generally.</P>
      <P>I have consistently acknowledged that while I would like to bring this proposal before the House as quickly as possible, great care has to be exercised to devise an effective penalty points system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of issues relating to the operation of the penalty points system. Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to the fact that there is no intermediate appeal provision included in the Bill in relation to penalty point offences. In addition, Deputies Mitchell and Keaveney inquired about the possibility of estab<Col N="382" /> lishing reciprocal arrangements between the system to be operated here and that applying in Northern Ireland. Deputy Kenny stated that the system does not provide for differing levels of penalty points depending on the severity of an offence.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the House that the focus of the penalty points system and the fixed charge system, which underpins the operation of penalty points, are both based on the understanding that the right of an accused person to allow a particular matter to proceed to court is not compromised. When a person considers that he or she is not guilty of an offence, he or she has the option to go to court. This understanding reflects not just the current arrangements applying under the Road Traffic Acts, but it is also the case that court intervention forms part of the practice in other states that operate penalty points systems.</P>
    <P>Penalty points systems in all the jurisdictions in which they operate are applicable following a conviction for an offence in court or alternatively following the payment of some form of administrative charge or penalty, which results in the avoidance of court proceedings. The level of penalty points associated with the making of such payments is invariably lower than in the case where a person is convicted in court.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system set out in the Bill has been designed so that it can be accommodated within the existing provisions applicable to the enforcement of road traffic law in this State and, in that context, it exhibits significant differences from the separate systems that operate in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It would not be possible in the short term to provide for full mutual recognition of those systems.</P>
    <P>However, following a period of experience with the operation of the system here, the question of achieving such recognition will be pursued.</P>
    <P>A particular example of the difference between the practice in Northern Ireland and the system proposed in this Bill can be found by reference to the fact that in Northern Ireland and also in Great Britain a court intervention is required before a person can be disqualified from driving as a result of the accumulation of penalty points. This means that where a person pays a fixed penalty so as to avoid an appearance in court in respect of a particular offence, the record of that payment must be opened to a court at a future date so that the disqualification can be put into effect. Under the proposed scheme in the Bill, there is no question of a record of the payment of a fixed charge and related endorsement of penalty points being opened to a court. In addition, the proposed system provides that there will be no direct court involvement in the application of a disqualification arising from penalty points. I understand that the current arrangements relating to court involvement in the United Kingdom in applying disqualification as a result of penalty points is under review at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of applying differing <Col N="383" /> levels of penalty points on the basis of the seriousness of an offence raised by a number of Deputies, I point out that the primary purpose of the new system is to instil a greater precautionary approach to drivers so as to prevent recurring breaches of traffic laws. It is not intended just to put people off the road. In addition, it must be recalled that the system has been designed to operate primarily on an administrative basis. In such a system the scope for graduation is very restricted and there are grave practical problems associated with determining the particular levels of seriousness of any particular incident. The system does, however, provide for different levels of penalty points for different categories of offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the prospect that there will be a greater emphasis on the potential guilt of a registered owner under the new systems provided for in this Bill. In regard to that, I point out that the concept of registered owner liability is well established in traffic law here.</P>
    <P>The operation of administrative charges and associated penalty point systems in all states where they apply is critically dependent on the registered owner being the first point of contact for the instigation of proceedings. This in no way compromises the innocence of the registered owner where he or she is not involved in the commission of the alleged offence.</P>
    <P>The concept that the registered owner may be held responsible for the commission of offences under the Road Traffic Acts has been in place since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. This reflects the reality that it is not always possible to determine the identity of the perpetrator of an offence at the particular time of its commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the introduction, as he sees it, of new powers for the Garda to directly impose penalties on motorists. This is not the case. Care has been taken in preparing this legislation to ensure that the exclusive role of the courts in the administration of justice has not been affected.</P>
    <P>The proposal set out in sections 11 and 12 reflects practice in many other states, in particular those that make extensive use of cameras and other technology to detect the commission of offences.</P>
    <P>As is the case in many other states, the only person who can be associated with a particular vehicle at the initial stage of an investigation is the registered owner. That person is entitled to name another party who may have been using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. This is precisely in line with provisions in place since 1961.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the information technology developments which are necessary for the introduction of penalty points. It is essential <Col N="384" /> to the administration of the system that it is supported by the computerisation of the national driver file. The central database of drivers or national driver file will be available this month. By next Monday, 16 out of 29 licensing authorities will have on-line access to the national driver file in Shannon, which means that the file will be instantly updated by these authorities as driving licence applications are processed. All authorities will have the system rolled out to them and will be on-line by June 2002. In the meantime licensing authorities who are not on-line will update the system by means of electronic file transfer at regular intervals. The necessary software amendments to the national driver file to record penalty points and administer the system have been made.</P>
    <P>The successful operation of the penalty points system will also depend on information technology improvements being developed by the Garda Síochána and by the Courts Service in relation to fixed charge payments and court convictions for penalty point offences. Developmental work on the relevant information technology systems for the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána is proceeding. It is likely that the required interface between the three systems will be fully in place and capable of dealing with the recording of penalty points before the end of next year.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the question of the overall levels of road casualties in this country. Deputies Naughten, Currie and others indicated that Ireland has the worst casualty rate in the European Union. This is not the case. It is surprising that Deputies and commentators outside here continue to make this allegation. It is important that they should have the facts and know them. The latest data for international comparison show that Ireland's rate of road deaths per 100,000 population, based on the situation in 1999, was at 11, the eighth highest of the 15 European Union member states. Therefore, we are in the middle range. However, it is the Government's intention, as I mentioned last week, that Ireland will rank among the best in the European Union in terms of road safety performance. We want to move up from the middle range and we are certainly not the worst.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten will be pleased to note that section 18 provides for the introduction of a new system of quality control on driving instruction by commercial enterprises. Many Deputies did not seem to be aware of the changes we have introduced. It is intended that driving instructors will have to undergo a compulsory test of their competence to instruct if they wish to continue giving instruction for reward. Where driving instructors are already registered with a recognised body/register, which meets certain agreed criteria, they will be exempt from this test.</P>
    <P>There has been much research, examination <Col N="385" /> and media comment on the vexed question of the involvement of young people in accidents. Research carried out in Ireland in 1997 shows that young drivers aged under 25 years of age were held to be responsible to a large extent for 55% of the accidents in which they were involved compared to 39% for older drivers. Our experience in relation to this issue is not unique and what is clear from international comparison is that in some states the problem of young driver accidents is of a greater depth than is the case here. In relation specifically to the question of formalised training, experience internationally does not show uniformly positive returns resulting from such schemes in terms of the involvement of young people in accidents.</P>
    <P>Particular reference was made to the position of provisional licence holders. The House will be aware that the new theory test is already in operation and that steps have been taken to reduce the number of people holding such licences by significantly increasing resources in the driver testing service.</P>
    <P>Deputies Gilmore, Keaveney, Clune, Smith and others referred to the issue of drugs and driving. I assure the House that it is currently illegal here to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle. This is set out in section 49(1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by section 10 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. The Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is, however, more complex than of alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is at the forefront of this research and is currently engaged in a two year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens which will be completed next year. The results of the research will be examined in the context of future road safety strategies so that specific measures can be identified to address this significant problem.</P>
    <P>Deputies Naughten, Gilmore, Durkan and others referred to the National Roads Authority and the role it plays in relation to road safety. Road safety issues are addressed by the NRA, in conjunction with local authorities, as part of the overall road project planning and design process with an emphasis on minimising the risk to road users. An important element of the road safety strategy is the carrying out of safety audits at various stages of the process, including prior to the opening of a scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The road type utilised must have regard to current and future projected volumes. In line with long established policy, the NRA is determining the appropriate type against the background of a level of service objective for road users corresponding to an average inter-urban speed of at least 50 miles per hour. A higher level of service objective applies to the five major inter-urban routes, which are to be developed to the level of motorway high quality dual carriageway. In the case of these routes, the national development plan provides for a level of service equivalent to at least 58 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Travel on all roads, irrespective of the type of road involved, entails a risk to road users. Analysis of Garda road accident reports consistently shows that driver error is the major contributory factor to road traffic accidents. In excess of 80% of road traffic accidents in 2000 were attributed to this cause. In the case of two vehicle accidents where specific contributory actions were identified, the main driver actions responsible were going to the wrong side of the road, exceeding safe speed and driving through stop-yield signs followed by improper overtaking.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the possibility of introducing a dedicated traffic corps. The establishment of a separate traffic corps independent of the Garda Síochána has been proposed from time to time. There is a traffic corps in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. In addition, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in traffic law enforcement as required. Responsibility for the Garda Síochána rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has stated in the House that the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps, independent of the Garda, would not be as beneficial to the community as the existing arrangement, which allows traffic corps members to deal with crime other than traffic related crime.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies expressed a view that the use of mobile phones while driving should be banned. It is not the intention at this stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers. However, the matter is being examined. The regulation of their use by drivers is being examined by the high level group on road safety and we await its views on that matter.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. We will have time to discuss the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage, but I am pleased to inform the House of the heartening news that as of today, road deaths are down by 18 on the same date last year. I will give the House a thought-provoking statistic. If road deaths had remained at the 1997 levels, which existed before the strategy, another 130 people would not be alive today.</P>
