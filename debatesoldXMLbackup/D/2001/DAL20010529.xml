    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, referendums will be held on 7 June to amend the Constitution with regard to the death penalty, the Nice Treaty and the International Criminal Court. Referendums were previously held on Cabinet confidentiality, the Amsterdam Treaty, the British-Irish Agreement and constitutional recognition for local government.</P>
      <P>Other proposals for constitutional change recommended by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution will be considered in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions arising from the Taoiseach's reply. First, the House <Col N="250" /> rejected, in effect, a proposed amendment to the Constitution drafted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as being hopelessly inadequate and grievously unsuitable for incorporation in it. Do I take it that the Government has now decided not to proceed any further with such an amendment and if that is the case, what will happen?</P>
      <P>Second, where lies that proposal arising from an undertaking given by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to seek to amend Article 40.1 of the Constitution to give constitutional rights to people with disabilities and to include that in the next tranche of amendments?</P>
      <P>Third, what action has been taken by the Government in response to the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which proposed, among other things, and upon which there was all-party agreement, that a special agency should be established to deal with the problem of unwanted or crisis pregnancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, the Government did not believe it would be appropriate to proceed with such a fundamental change to the Constitution without all-party agreement. Every reasonable effort was made to achieve that and, therefore, at this stage there is no further action planned on that. Perhaps it can be taken up again between the spokespersons and the Whips.</P>
      <P>On the disability question, legislation is due in the autumn. I have no information on the referendum. It did not form part of the tranche of five, to the best of my knowledge, but I can check for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On the third question, last week the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, dealt fairly comprehensively with the aspects on which there is agreement and outlined his plans for setting up an agency which will progress what was agreed by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to try to reduce the enormous numbers of people from this country who go elsewhere seeking abortions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any commitments in respect of holding a referendum on abortion to any of the four Independent Deputies who usually support the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked this question many times. I outlined my view on that before and since 1997, that we should prepare a Green Paper and present it to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and try to seek a consensus on the issue. As Deputy Quinn said, we have managed to reach consensus on various aspects of that issue for which there will now be a separate unit set up in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet committee has taken the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and is deliberating on that issue. I hope over the next few months we can try to finish those deliber<Col N="251" /> ations. Until that has happened, there is no commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not directly answer my question. May I rephrase it? In particular, has the Taoiseach given any commitment to Deputies Fox or Blaney in respect of the holding of a referendum on abortion or is what he is telling us here now the full total of his understanding with them, or is there an alternative understanding which he has reached with these two Deputies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I just said &ndash; I did answer the question &ndash; that until the Cabinet deliberates on both the Green Paper and particularly the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution there is no commitment to do anything. This is a matter still to be dealt with if we can achieve both a wording and a legislative base. However, the Cabinet has not completed its work on this and until that happens, there is no position to be stated, either to the Independents or to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's opinion of the recommendation by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that a Bill to amend the Constitution should not go before the public until 90 days have elapsed, to allow people an opportunity to consider all the aspects of the legislation? In the light of the MRBI survey, the results of which were published on 19 May in <i>The Irish Times, </i>which showed that most people did not know what the Nice Treaty was about, good, bad or indifferent, should this recommendation not have been heeded? This recommendation was not heeded and people have been given only 21 days to consider, for example, the Nice Treaty. Is this not a gross disservice by the Taoiseach to the people? Would the Taoiseach's opinion of that recommendation be that it should be followed and that it was a mistake not to follow it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, there is in draft form within the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, something similar to what the Deputy said, but the committee did not make a recommendation and its report has not yet been issued. There is no basis for the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach agree that it is a very bad development that last week more than 60% of the Irish people said they knew nothing, or very little, about the contents of the Nice Treaty and that, in retrospect, it was a huge mistake to force this issue by going to the people in such a short period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is impossible to get a wording that will safeguard the health <Col N="252" /> and life of the woman in all circumstances and, therefore, such a referendum cannot take place, and that it should be so stated? Will the Taoiseach further agree that a referendum for a blanket ban on terminations in this State would be to totally ignore in a very hypocritical way the fact that in recent days it was revealed that more than 6,000 women with Irish addresses availed of terminations last year in Britain? This number is only for one year. Would the Taoiseach agree that the best way for this State to proceed is to legislate for the findings of the Supreme Court judgment providing for the safeguarding of the health and life of the woman? </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's first point. We are the only country in the European Union that is holding a referendum and it is constitutionally necessary in our case. When I spoke to Deputy Quinn last Christmas on the subject, I stated my view that I would be in favour of a referendum. The present debate has been ongoing for the past three or four weeks in one form or another and has probably attracted more attention than many other referenda in the past. It has probably attracted more attention than the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty or the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. People seem to be more informed now and as we deal with the more fundamental issues in a few years time, I think that debate will be developed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other matters, the Deputy has his views, and I know that he will be the first to appreciate that there are hundreds of thousands of people in this country who hold alternative views. Many thousands of people went to the trouble of writing to the all-party committee and 150,000 people submitted their views to those who were preparing the Green Paper. This number consisted of differing views. It is the Minister for Health and Children, not me, who is dealing with this issue and he answered questions extensively in the House last week. The Government hopes to complete its work and give its considered response. It is a complex issue.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has read the excellent report of the All Party Committee on the Constitution will be aware of the different legal, ethical and moral views and the different views of obstetricians gynaecologists and others, including those from a religious background, given to that committee. It is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's first reply he seemed to indicate that the question of amending the Constitution to make our judges more accountable to the citizens and to the Oireachtas is now in the hands of Opposition parties and the Whips. If I heard the Taoiseach correctly, I take it the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not propose to bring forward new proposals and, more importantly, as was the case in relation to the controversial legislation to amend the Constitution to provide for civil div<Col N="253" /> orce and remarriage, that the Government took the precaution that was deemed necessary to publish in advance the legislation that would flow from such a constitutional amendment so that people would know precisely what they would get in terms of primary legislation if they were to vote to change the Constitution in the first instance. That request was made in respect of the judicial council. Can I take it, therefore, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has washed his hands of any reform in this area and that the onus of legislative responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the Opposition parties and their Whips in this Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not what I said and I do not think that interpretation could be taken from it. What I said was that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made every reasonable effort to follow as closely as possible what the all-party committee had said, the Susan Denham report and the justice who was given the task of doing this to try to get agreement. That was not possible in the time or in the circumstances or through the efforts of the Minister. If that proves possible or is likely I am sure the issue could be taken up again. It would be good to hear what the Minister could do that would satisfy people. We heard a great deal about what he could not do to satisfy people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear that the Taoiseach believes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform handled the affair well because there is a widespread view that he banjaxed any chance of the legislation going through this House or being successful in a referendum. Will the Taoiseach give a simple answer to this question? Is it the Government's intention to pursue a referendum on the issue of judicial conduct during the lifetime of this Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was our clear intention. We had hoped to have it next week. As I made clear, unless there was agreement in the House on that fundamental issue it would not be the desirable thing to do. As of a few weeks ago there was no possibility of achieving that. If that position changes the Government would, of course, reconsider the matter. In the meantime there are many other important constitutional issues we could examine, even though that issue almost got agreement within the all-party committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach cannot have forgotten the chaos which surrounded the introduction of the proposed amendment to the Constitution as brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Amendments appeared late at night, we were confronted with a guillotine and there was little or no discussion and certainly no dialogue. May I clarify that the current position is that the Government will not bring forward proposals to give effect to the recommendations of the Denham committee and <Col N="254" /> that if any proposals are to be brought forward it will be the Opposition parties who will do so because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not propose to publish in draft the kind of legislation that would emanate from a constitutional amendment or a change in the way in which the Constitution must be measured in the first instance? Is that the position as of now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time in this Question Time, that is not the position. The position is that the Minister's proposals exist. He outlined in great detail how this would work. Deputy Quinn seems to be saying that if the legislation was in draft form and his party had more time to consider it, it would withdraw its opposition. It appears he is happy with the wording and the other matters, but he has not seen the legislation. I will convey that to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the dying days of this administration, is it not highly unlikely that we will have a further constitutional amendment leading to a referendum? If he is not prepared to clarify that point fully, can the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will not give legislative priority to any such proposal between now and the next general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On what issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Any proposal to amend the Constitution. Are we to have a further referendum before the next general election or is any such idea being given the lowest possible priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Deputy O'Keeffe is vice-chairman of the committee chaired by Deputy Lenihan, which has done considerable work on this. There are aspects of the committee's five reports, which are still getting very active consideration. As Deputy O'Keeffe knows, one of the early reports suggested how to take the issues together. There was great pressure on me for three years to take an omnibus set of amendments. However, when more than one issue is taken, everybody changes position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach tried to rush it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to examine the 26 proposals outlined in the earlier reports. Given that I heard so many problems with regard to three or four of the issues, the Deputy would definitely be correct that it is unlikely I would try to deal with 26 together. They are all very important. In the life time of this Government, we will have had seven referenda, each on a separate issue. That is far more than any other Government ever did. There are a number of other ones that I would still like to try to deal with, some of which are more important than others. The general constitutional issues were <Col N="255" /> covered in the committee's first report. The second and third reports covered the Seanad and the Presidency. As I said here, I do not altogether agree with some of its recommendations. The fourth report was on the courts and the Judiciary and the fifth report on abortion is before a Cabinet committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Taoiseach's response it is difficult to understand whether there will be a further referendum. What are the Taoiseach's priority issues before the next election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are covered in those five reports. There would not be any sense in going beyond those. There are many issues in that first report and I hope we might be able to get some omnibus way of dealing with them. It would be a pity not to address them because the arguments have long been set out with regard to dealing with them. It may not be easy to deal with the issues because often when a proposal is made, the debate is about what is not included rather than what is included. I do not want to get into that type of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to answer for the Taoiseach, but can I take it he would regard having another referendum on the Nice Treaty as a priority, if this one is rejected?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has made his name by reading signs and interpreting messages and gestures when dealing with industrial disputes. Is he choosing to ignore a recommendation from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution? Whether it is in draft or finalised form is academic. The recommendation is that a Bill to amend the Constitution should not be passed by the Oireachtas until 90 days after its publication. Given that ratification of the Nice Treaty is not required until December 2002, what was the reason to only give 21 days instead of three months? There is no legal reason to transcend a well considered recommendation from the all-party committee which, as the Taoiseach said, has undertaken a long and difficult task. Why is this recommendation being ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not even been presented yet. I first heard of it when Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned it a few weeks ago. I understand it may or may not come to me within the next few months. One cannot ignore something which has not been presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach unaware of this matter? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Until Deputy O'Keeffe informed me. It has happened a number of times already that matters which are confidential to the committee have been disclosed in some way. My position is that, when the committee wishes me to see a report, it is presented to me. I have made <Col N="256" /> myself available in relation to the work of the committee whenever I was asked to do so. I cannot be accused of ignoring a matter which has not been presented.</P>
      <P>On the question itself, I can see merit in it in some situations but not in others. A process involving a green paper, a white paper and further consultation, could go on for years. At the end of all that, does one then go on to another stage lasting a few months? I understand the committee stated that, in exceptional circumstances, the Dáil could take the opposite approach. However, it is a reasonably regular approach to constitutional change to have green papers, white papers and a consultative process. I do not believe that allowing a period of three months would make a great difference. From my experience of many referenda, it is only in the final few weeks that people begin to show an interest. That is just how it happens and it is naive to pretend otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is probably aware that the committee on the Constitution made specific proposals in 1997 in connection with Seanad Éireann. It recommended that both the nomination and electoral procedures for Seanad Éireann should be altered, with a view to achieving gender balance in the Seanad. Has the Taoiseach reflected on those recommendations and could he share his views with the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that formed part of some 26 or 27 recommendations from the all-party committee, which have been sent for comment to the various Departments. Comments have been received on all of them. Most of them are non contentious and many of them are technical. There is agreement on practically all of them, with the possible exception of one or two technical issues which were not teased out. Gender proofing was an important part of the recommendations, all of which I have no problem in supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Taoiseach's response that, despite the promises made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the last general election, this Government has no intention of introducing a constitutional amendment to abolish ground rents? Has the Taoiseach made a sincere effort to resolve this issue? Is he not disappointed and is it not appalling that the issue did not get the priority it deserved, despite the promises made by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue has received priority attention to see if it is feasible. Over the past year, the Attorney General has made considerable efforts to resolve it. It may yet prove possible but it may take some time. The Attorney General believes that it is possible.</P>

      <P>The costs relating to the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to £218,000. The Government also facilitated the legal engagement with the independent commission of inquiry of the group, Justice for the Forgotten, representing the relatives and victims of the bombings, and these costs amount to £398,330. Therefore, the total costs of the current examination of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to £616,330.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference were approved by the Government following consultations with Justice for the Forgotten and Judge Hamilton, and were accepted as satisfactory by all concerned.

      <P>I have two supplementary questions. Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the co-operation which the commission receives from the relevant British authorities, such as the RUC and the Ministry of Defence? Given the current challenge to the remit of the committee inquiring into the Abbeylara incident, what steps will the Government take to ensure that an Oireachtas committee will be properly empowered to deal with Mr. Justice Barron's report when it is completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the independent commission that considerable progress has been made. Some material requested from the British authorities has not yet been received. Until it is and assessed, it is not possible to give a timeframe for the finalisation of the report. Much of the information requested was provided. It is a new aspect being pursued by Mr. Justice Barron and he is waiting for it. The matter was raised with the British authorities. We were told that although it is difficult to find and assemble the material, the request is being treated with the seriousness it deserves. Progress is slow, but Mr. Justice Barron requires the information and we believe that it will be assembled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agreed a process to examine the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and are in the first stage. We await the independent commission's <Col N="258" /> report before proceeding to the next one. The case of Abbeylara is different from the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We will proceed with the process that was agreed for the bombings. Regarding the overall context raised by the Deputy, the legislation is being examined and the court case this week is a challenge to any Oireachtas committee being able to investigate anything. That could have an effect, but I hope not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the Abbeylara inquiry is not relevant to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. However, my point was that the Taoiseach's agreement with the Justice for the Forgotten group is that Mr. Justice Barron's report will go to a committee of this House. We must be sure that a committee of this House will be able to work on it, as the Taoiseach committed the Government to in discussion with that group. What material in particular, requested from the British authorities, is still awaited? Will Mr. Justice Barron and his assistants seek this directly or is his request reinforced by diplomatic activity and the Taoiseach's direct conversations with the British Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point in the first question. If the action against the committee were to win, we could not investigate anything. We are attempting to ensure that it is not the case. There are many aspects being pursued on the second issue. While Mr. Justice Barron's work is fact finding and assessing all aspects of the bombings and their sequel, including the circumstances, causes, perpetrators, investigations into them, including the Garda investigation which he has, and the RUC's, the handling of evidence, why no prosecutions took place, and particularly those aspects of the information he is endeavouring to follow through &ndash; aspects as to why no investigations or prosecutions took place and why investigations ceased very speedily &ndash; he is particularly anxious to get the full picture. All of the things the Deputy said are the means by which we are following through. We are diplomatically doing so through Departments with myself backing up Justice Barron's case. What the Deputy said is correct in that Justice Barron is making the initial review and then we will back it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree with me when I express the view that this House is disappointed at the inevitable slowness that has been associated with this inquiry for reasons that have already been stated. In the light of that delay, will the Government indicate when it will move on the six recommendations of the Victims' Commission chaired by former Tánaiste, Mr. Wilson? Does the Taoiseach recognise that report is now nearly two years old having been published in July 1999 and that there are a number of specific recommendations that could give some comfort, recognition and monetary compensation to the victims about which there is no doubt in relation <Col N="259" /> to where and who they are 28 years after the event? Has the Government considered moving forward on the implementation of these recommendations in advance of any final conclusions that Justice Barron may come to in respect of his report or, indeed, any committee that might subsequently investigate that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not totally up to date on the position but I know the Minister has moved on some of these recommendations. Some of those recommendations also deal with other cases and he hopes to bring forward his views on some of them shortly. He has also been working on the recommendations. If he has not moved on some of them, I understand his intention is to do so. I will bring the Deputy's question to the attention of the Minister. It is about two months since I checked it but, at that stage, some of the resource activities were being dealt with &ndash; issues around the Seamus Ludlow case and some other cases. I will check the latest position on that for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the ruling, a Cheann Comhairle. In relation to the £218,000 and the ongoing inquiry, where stand the concerns of the survivors and relatives of victims of the 1972 Sackville Place bombing and the 1973 bombing who are working alongside the victims of the 1974 bombings and who are wondering whether all the issues dealing with the 1974 bombings have to be dealt with first before their issues are dealt with? Is there any form of parallel treatment of their case which would ensure they do not feel left behind and overwhelmed by the huge amount of suffering in 1974?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards all these issues and bombings, hopefully, some information in the trawl and investigation might cast some light on the circumstances of the other cases. That would be helpful. The terms of reference include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, that is, the explosions which took place in Parnell Street, <Col N="260" /> Talbot Street and South Leinster Street on 17 May 1974 and the bomb in North Street in Monaghan on the same day. They also extended them to take into account what are known as the Dundalk bombings which took place during Christmas week of 1975 and they also offered to look at the Seamus Ludlow case but that offer has not yet been taken up, although there are considerations. They are the ones to which the report relates. I am sure information unfolded in any of those other examples would be used in those cases, but they are not part of the terms of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the Taoiseach's original reply and to the point put to him by Deputy Noonan. The committee that sought to inquire into the Abbeylara affair found that existing compellability legislation is deficient, that there is a need for it to be put beyond reasonable doubt that this House has the power to call witnesses in committee and sub-committee and that issues of privilege are properly extended to Members not only in committee but when taking consultations and advice from advisers. As the Taoiseach is aware, short draft legislation was presented to the Minister of State to deal with that issue. Has the Government yet formed a view on whether it will bring forward that legislation, given that all committees, including the one that may have to deal with Mr. Justice Barron's report, will be effectively spancelled in their ability to conduct the type of inquiry that would be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Government has formed a view. We are taking into account that legislation, which the parliamentary draftsman and officials in the Attorney General's office are examining. It is our view that it would not be appropriate to bring forward or publish legislation until the matter, which is before the court today and possibly for the next few days, is dealt with, as there is a fundamental challenge to the right of public representatives to in any way form part of these investigative committees. It is our advice that this issue must be dealt with and then the Government will bring forward legislation if that is necessary.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach agree that the most important issue in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is to get to <Col N="261" /> the nub of the matter and particularly to establish responsibility, and whether that responsibility includes involvement of any State? Has the Taoiseach spoken directly to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, about this investigation and the papers, other material or information that need to be handed over by the British authorities? Is the tardiness in handing over such information the reason for the delay in holding the inquiry? If the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British Prime Minister, what was his reaction? If the Taoiseach has not yet raised the matter with him, will he do so to end the delay in holding this inquiry? </P>
      <P>As certain elements of the Garda bitterly resented the Abbeylara inquiry, have all papers and necessary information in the possession of the Garda been handed over without question?

Information that was requested early on and in the course of the examination has been handed over, but as Mr. Justice Barron has gone through more detail, new issues have come to light on which he wishes to get further information. The difficulty perhaps is that that information is not there.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Barron would like important information which he believes is required assembled and researched. To date, the British authorities have co-operated with us on these matters and I am sure they will do so in this instance.

Is éard a bheadh i gceist ná múchtóir tine agus dhá aláram deatach a insealbhú i ngach áitreabh ar chostas £100 in aghaidh an áitribh. Cuireadh moill ar an togra seo níos túisce i mbliana de bharr deacrachtaí dlí a bhí bainteach leis agus a bhí le soiléiriú ag mo Roinn le hOifig an Ard-Aighne. Tá an soiléiriú sin faighte agam ón Ard Aighne anois agus táim sásta gur féidir brú ar aghaidh leis an togra dá bharr. Dá bhrí sin, ar iarratas uaimse, scríobh mo Roinn le déanaí chuig na ceithre phríomhchomhairlí contae &ndash; Corcaigh, Gaillimh, Maigh Eo agus Dún na nGall &ndash; a bhfuil oileáin ina gceantair feidhme acu ag tairiscint deontais de 50% den chostas chun an trealamh atá luaite agam a insealbhú.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 (4) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Minister must sign a commencement order before the Act comes into effect. The commencement order may refer to specified provisions or be general in nature but must specify a day or days on which the Act or the specified provisions come into operation.</P>
      <P>I intend to make an order bringing the whole Act into effect shortly. However the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to address certain practical arrangements before this can be done. In this context I met with the Independent Radio and Television Commission on 26 March 2001 to discuss many of the issues arising from the enactment of the legislation. In addition, my Department has been in consultation with the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) with regard to the financial and staffing resources which it estimates it will require when it assumes the responsibilities of the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to fulfil its statutory remit. The Independent Radio and Television Commission has made a submission seeking additional resources and my Department is currently examining the submission with a view to securing the necessary sanction for the additional resources needed to carry out its new functions.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the commencement of the Act, the Government has recently appointed four additional members to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC). Members of the BCC who are serving at the time of the commencement order will continue to serve as members following commencement. The appointment of four new members is in line with the requirement in section 22(6) of the Act that, with a nine member Commission, a minimum of four members must be women and a minimum of four members must be men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> The Broadcasting Act, 2001, also provides me with enabling powers to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity. However, as I have said previously in this House, there are many complex issues to be addressed and I do not believe it would be appropriate to establish the station as a separate statutory entity until such issues are resolved satisfactorily. I expect that the process of establishing Teilifís na Gaeilge, otherwise known as TG4, as an independent concern will take a number of years.</P>

The provisions relating to the establishment of the DTT platform relate to sections 5, 9, 13 and 15 of the Act. With regard to the setting up of digital television a great deal of work had to be done and that work is continuing. The Deputy will have seen advertisements in the daily newspapers from 17 May and in the Sunday papers from 20 May with regard to DTT in Ireland and the question of the selection process. The Deputy will know there are two approaches to this. The first is the separation and sale by RTE of the existing transmission network and the second is the selection of the DTT multiplex company to which I have just referred. We will have an opportunity later on Question No. 43 to further discuss this. At this juncture, all the procedures are taking place to ensure that the Act will be commenced as soon as possible. The question of the selection process has been going ahead and RTE has also been working on the issue of the transmission process. We hope DTT will be in operation in the first half of next year.</P>

      <P>I fail to see from where the Minister derives the confidence that a service will be available in the early part of next year. From what I can see progress is very slow and I put it to her that there is a need for far more urgency particularly in terms of setting up the transmission company from which the other elements flow. Is there a stand-off or standstill because the licence fee increase issue has not been resolved and does this prevent matters from moving forward at a reasonable pace?</P>

      <P>The whole question of the licence fee has nothing to do with the proposals in this Bill concerning the multiplex company or the existing transmission network. We have already outlined the position in advertisements in the newspapers over the period 17 to 20 May. As I have said, the position regarding the DTT multiplex operator selection process was outlined in newspaper advertisements between 17 and 20 May. From 8 June, it is expected that the information memorandum, the invitation to apply, will be available to interested parties who comply with conditions set out in advertisements. The closing date for receipt of proposals is 3 August and it expected that the selection process will have concluded by October. The selection criteria to be applied will be made available to those who have applied for an information memorandum. The Deputy is aware that parties who wish to receive a copy of the information memorandum will have to pay £5,000 to the Department. Upon receipt of that money, the information necessary to complete the next step of the process will be given.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the arrangements that are being made for the sale of shares in the company which hold the radio and television transmission network and the awarding of a national monopoly franchise for DTT multiplexing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the revised arrangements agreed by Government last year as provided for in the Broadcasting Act, 2001, for the introduction of digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; in Ireland. The revised arrangements provide that the DTT platform will be established by two separate but interlinked transactions: the separation out and sale by RTE of the existing RTE transmission network as a going concern, subject to RTE being able to retain a shareholding of up to 28% in the new entity, and the selection of the DTT multiplex company &ndash; the DTT retail business &ndash; to be licensed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental project management group chaired by my Department and including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Public Enterprise is managing the process to select the DTT multiplex company. A consortium of advisers headed by AIB corporate finance is executing that process under the direction of the project management group. The public phase of the selection process commenced in the week ending 18 May when advertisements were placed in national and international newspapers inviting interested parties to participate in the process to be selected as the DTT multiplex company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> I understand from RTE that the public phase of its transmission network sale process has also begun and that RTE's advisers commenced the distribution of its pre-sale document to interested parties on 11 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if this unique asset is to be sold or awarded following an outright auction to the highest bidder or following some other qualitative assessment of bids? If it goes to the highest bidder, what are her Department's expectations of how much will be received for the transmission system? How much money is expected to be offered for the system and the national terrestrial digital multiplex franchise? What steps have been taken and conditions imposed by the Minister upon both transactions to protect consumer interests? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether this will be decided by a beauty parade or an auction to the highest bidder; some countries have taken the first option but I think the best option is a mixture of the two. These issues were brought by me to Government and a strong stance has been taken regarding selection criteria. It is important to say that all parties who wish to receive a copy of the information memorandum must pay a non-refundable fee. The payment can be regarded as a fee to participate in the process and its purpose is to discourage those who are not serious potential bidders.</P>
      <P>Those who are serious will be given the opportunity to receive information on the selection criteria, including details of the weightings which have been approved by Government and which will be included in the information memorandum. This approach strengthens the fairness and transparency of the process as it ensures all interested parties can access selection criteria at the same time. It is inappropriate to discuss selection criteria at this stage as it is important that information be given at the same time to all those who comply with the criteria outlined in newspaper advertisements.</P>
      <P>RTE is responsible for the process of planning and managing the sale of its transmission network. The Government has mandated me to oversee the process and to ensure that the achievement of Government objectives for the introduction of DTT is not inhibited. From the beginning, I have stressed the importance of ensuring the process auditor is given all documentation and supplied with all necessary information on an ongoing basis. The process auditor will have to be satisfied that both processes are fair and transparent as they develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister set out in detail the mechanism that will be employed in each case to guarantee that the privatisation of a State asset will be carried out in an open, fair and transparent manner? Will she explain why this responsibility has not been handed to the Office <Col N="268" /> of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation which seems to be the appropriate competent regulator to oversee the sale and award?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know from discussions in the House over a considerable period that a management and advisory group has been involved in this. The group includes representatives of a number of Departments. I wanted to ensure transparency and fairness are elements of the process, so I appointed Mr. Frank Murray, who has had a distinguished career in the highest ranks of the Civil Service, to act as process auditor in the establishment of both of these processes.</P>
      <P>The report of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation into the licensing of DTT has indicated that the DTT transmission licence will require a roll-out of the transmission network, equating to coverage at launch of approximately 65% of the population and coverage of approximately 95% of the population over five years. Technical information is dealt with by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The supplementary question asked by Deputy McGinley mirrors his approach, which is culturally different to my own as I believe this is a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and not a purely technical one to be dealt with by the Department of Public Enterprise or the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>

      <P>Níor thug mo Roinnse aon scéim nua isteach ó thús na bliana. Déanann mo Roinnse a cuspóirí maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn mar aon leis an nGaeilge a chaomhnú agus a neartú inti trí dheontais a chur ar fáil trí scéimeanna éagsúla dá cuid. Baintear úsáid as na scéimeanna seo a leanas chun na cuspóirí sin a chur i gcrích: scéim labhairt na Gaeilge; scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge; scéim cúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht do dhaoine fásta; scéim spreagadh na Gaeilge; deontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht); scéim champaí samhradh d'aos óg na Gaeltachta agus scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mhéadaigh mé an deontas a íoctar leis na teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta faoi scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ó £5 go £5.50 in aghaidh an lae i mbliana, an dara bliain as a chéile a méadaíodh an deontas sin. Maidir leis an scéim tithíochta tá na deontais feabhsúcháin méadaithe go mór le gairid, deontais nua tugtha isteach agus leasú déanta ar rialacha chun an scéim a chur in oiriúint do shaol na Gaeltachta mar atá inniu. Tá Bille <Col N="269" /> nua tithíochta, Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) (Leasú) 2001, sínithe ag an Uachtarán le gairid. Mar is eol don Teachta tá an Choimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i mbun oibre agus beidh mé ag súil le moltaí fiúntacha uaidh, moltaí faoi scéimeanna nua san áireamh, maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar gnáthurlabhartha phobal na Gaeltachta. Níl aon amhras orm ach go gcuireann Scéimeanna mo Roinne-se go mór le húsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus gan iad a bheith i bhfeidhm go mbeadh úsáid na Gaeilge níos laige inti ná mar atá.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge sa chuid sin den tír lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht is é lárchuspóir polasaí mo Roinne-se ná a húsáid a leathadh ar fud na tíre. Cabhraítear le chur chun cinn an pholasaí sin trí cúnamh airgid a chur ar fáil as Ciste na Gaeilge de chuid mo Roinne (£1.75m sa Chiste i mbliana) do thionscadail éagsúla fhiúntacha Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre ar nós Gaillimh le Gaeilge, Tiobraid Árann ag Labhairt agus Gael-Taca, Corcaigh. Tugtar cúnamh don drámaíocht trí Ghaeilge agus chun foilsitheoireacht agus scríbhneoireacht na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn as an gCiste chomh maith trí dheontais bhliantúla a chur ar fáil do Thaibhdearc na Gaillimhe agus Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge faoi seach.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag díriú i mbliana ar an mBille Comhionannais um Theangacha Oifigiúla a bheidh mar chuspóir aige feabhas a chur ar an bhfáil ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge do shaoranaigh a bhfuil seirbhís den chineál sin á lorg acu. Táthar ag súil leis go bhfoilseofar an Bille sin san Fhómhar.</P>

An bhfuil aon tuairim ag an Aire Stáit cathain a bheidh an tuairisc agus na moltaí aici ón Choimisiún?</P>

    <P>Ag féachaint ar an nGalltacht, nach n-aontaíonn an tAire Stáit go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach taighde den chéad scoth a dhéanamh ar mheon an phobail i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Muna mbíonn meon an phobail ar eolas againn agus an <Col N="270" /> fhadhb glan in ár n-aigne beidh sé deacair scéimeanna oiriúnacha a chur in áit.</P>

Tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh sé agam faoi dheireadh mí Meán Fomhair, ach roimh dheireadh na bliana ar aon nós.</P>
      <P>Tá an ceart ag an Teachta mar gheall ar mheon an phobail. B'fhéidir gur rud tábhachtach é sin a fháil amach. Nuair a fheiceann tú an méid airgid atá á chur ar fáil do Ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn tá tú ag caint faoi athrú a chur ar mheon an phobail. Ach i mo thuairimse tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh níos mó béime ar chúrsaí oideachais mar cuidíonn sé sin go mór leis an Ghaeilge a úsáid taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá súil agam fosta le cabhair TG4 agus rudaí mar sin a bhfuil spéis ag daoine óga iontu go mbeidh níos mó suime acu an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus go mbeimid in ann an Ghaeilge a chloisteáil i ngach áit. Ag éirí as an Choimisiún tá súil agam go mbeidh moltaí praiticiúla agam. Tá mé ag súil chomh maith go gcuideoidh an Bille Teanga go mór le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ach tá sé deacair athrú a dhéanamh ar mheon an phobail i leith na Gaeilge. Tá jab an-mhaith déanta go mór mhór ag na daoine a luaigh mé. Dá mbeadh sé éasca bheinn ábalta achan rud a dhéanamh ach le cúnamh Dé cuideoidh na moltaí ó Fhoras na Gaeilge chomh maith leis an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathnú ar fud na tíre.</P>

What efforts has she made to acquire additional staff, and what assurance can she give the House that in future there will be no such delays which, had the Commission initiated the legal process, could have resulted in the Department ending up before the European Court of Justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>I accept there was a delay. The reason was that in recent years there was a concentration of staff on the designation of sites under both the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive. That very important work needed to be completed as effectively as possible. However, I directed that priority be given to the completion of the report. It has now been completed and submitted to the European Commission in accordance with the commitment I made in this House in April. The next report is due early next year and work on it has already commenced.</P>

If the Deputy puts down specific questions pertaining to the cuckoo, corncrake or any other bird he believes to be at risk, I will be happy to provide further information on the matter.

However, the overall situation is unsatisfactory. I have repeatedly asked one question of the Minister and she promised to consider doing something about it. It is that a census of wildlife in general be carried out with the aid of school children, particularly national school children. The Department, apparently, does not have the resources to do it.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to my earlier replies on this topic and in particular to my reply to Question No. 30 on 11 April 2001. Additional information supplied by RTE in support of its appli<Col N="274" /> cation for an increase in the level of television licence fee was received in my Department on 20 April 2001 and has been examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers, who were engaged by my Department to advise on the application. I expect to receive the consultants' report on the additional information within days. On the basis of this report, in conjunction with PricewaterouseCoopers' earlier report on RTE's application, I will develop my proposals for Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to bring this matter to Government for decision as soon as possible. However, I must be certain that any increase I might propose can be objectively justified. I have no plans at present to publish PricewaterhouseCoopers' reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the additional information required by the consultants was provided to the Department and has been passed to them. Does the Minister not agree that the present situation regarding the RTE application for a licence fee increase is most unsatisfactory, particularly with regard to the type of strategic planning RTE must engage in with the introduction of digital terrestrial television? Can the Minister assure the House that she will have brought her recommendations regarding the proposed licence fee increase to Government before the summer recess? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to have all the information to hand to make this decision. As I outlined on the last occasion, the delay was not mine but was due to the fact that further information was sought from RTE by the consultants I engaged to evaluate the application. Now that the information is with the consultants and I hope to receive it within a number of days, I will be in a position to evaluate the application along with the additional application. When I have completed that, I will bring it to Government and a Government decision will follow.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and other Members will be aware that if there is to be an increase, I must be able to say that the proposal put to me, including the additional information, has been objectively justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The information was supplied to the Minister by RTE on 20 April and passed on by the Department at that time. The fact that she has not yet received the recommendations from the consultants means the process is extremely slow, particularly in the context of the urgent situation facing RTE. With regard to the earlier part of Question No. 47, is the Minister disposed to publish the PricewaterhouseCoopers report when it is completed and received by the Department? Then all Members can assess the real situation in the run up to the Government decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to evaluate this issue. Obviously, if I ask an objective, professional firm to do the work I will <Col N="275" /> give it the time it wants to do the job in an effective manner. I know the firm will do so and that it took only the amount of time needed to carry out the objective evaluation. As I said, when I receive that information, which should be within days, I will be in a position to make my final decision. I will then bring that to Government for a decision.</P>
      <P>Regarding the publication of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the Deputy will know that this is part of a Government decision and it would not be appropriate to publish information that is still part of the decision-making process. This is the usual procedure when decisions are being taken &ndash; that information remains for the Government to decide on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that RTE is in a difficult, if not impossible, situation in that for a number of years it has been running at a deficit? It is in a limbo because it is difficult to plan for the future and that has repercussions not only for RTE but for bodies such as TG4, which depend on RTE for a significant amount of their funding. Does the Minister agree that an early decision is important and should be made so that RTE and other stations which depend on it know what the future holds for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, as soon as that information comes to hand I will not delay in making my decision. It is important when talking about public funds that this matter is looked at objectively and in the possible event of complaints being made to the European Commission about unacceptable State aids to RTE. That is not to say I accept the licence fee revenue constitutes a State aid but it is important to look at this matter objectively and to give a considered view at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister stated time and again that she does not believe RTE deserves a licence fee increase and that from the first time an application was put before her, when she became Minister, she said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to an increase? She said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a proportionate increase based on the cost of living index and based on cost indices of any sort. How will she change her mind now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where that information came. Obviously, the Deputy misunderstood what I said. At no stage did I say RTE would not be considered for a licence fee increase. Obviously I would not be wasting my time, that of the Department or of PricewaterhouseCoopers in taking on a great amount of information to be evaluated without taking their proposals seriously. I would not have asked that firm to do so if I did not think it was necessary to look in a very objective way at the proposal put forward by RTE. I have always said that if there <Col N="276" /> is to be an increase it will have to be based on value for money. Nobody would object to that, as we are dealing with public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We want value for money and a level playing pitch. If the Minister is to allow RTE a licence fee increase, will she make that conditional on the Freedom of Information Act applying to all public servants, particularly those in RTE, and not just to Deputies and Senators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, the Freedom of Information Act applies to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we not getting the information about the broadcasters? Their incomes have been queried but information has not been forthcoming. What about the high profile people, who are slagging us day in, day out as if we were fair game?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Deputy is saying and questions have been asked on this for a number of years. The answer we have been given to date is that commercial sensitivities are involved when it comes to certain individuals. As the Deputy will be aware, the Cabinet sought certain information and some information was given regarding the money paid to certain ranks of individuals and sections in RTE. This is a matter the Deputy might like to raise with RTE directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE will not give me any information. The Minister has to bring in legislation and tell RTE it will not get any money until it operates under the same conditions as us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the Minister pointed out earlier that it cannot be published at present as it is part of the decision-making process of Government. Once the decision is made, however, will the Minister publish it? In any event, we could then obtain it under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that the licence fee increase and the setting up of the transmission company were not linked. Does she not agree, however, that it is unlikely agreement will be reached regarding the setting up of the transmission company until RTE knows its financial position? It will obviously not know that until the Minister has reached a decision on the licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was talking about the licence fee and setting up the DTT, I was referring to the fact that there is obviously no link between licence fees and the setting up of these structures. RTE would argue that to be able to improve its service it would need an increase in licence fees and that is precisely what I will be looking at in terms of the PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation. Those are some of the arguments that have already been put to me both by the chairman of the authority and the director-gen<Col N="277" /> eral and they will be issues of importance. When I said there was no link, I was talking about the setting up of the structures and the selection process of DTT as well as the construction and sale by RTE, as that is all part of the broadcasting Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should indicate clearly her goodwill towards RTE. From the terms of reference of the examination being carried out, RTE management and the whole organisation has lost confidence in the Department providing proper funding to it. Will the Minister make a statement indicating that she does favour an increase in the licence fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that public service broadcasting is an important part of broadcasting and has been given its rightful role in the broadcasting Act. The Deputy will not be surprised when I say that any group or body seeking funding from a Government must obviously be able to justify its case, and that is the case here. I am looking forward to examining the proposals that are to be put forward in the next few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all sites normally open at this time of year, managed by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, and where a guide service is provided, which were closed or which did not reopen due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, are now open. The reopening of the sites was made possible by the relaxation on controls that had been put in place to prevent the spread of the disease. The expert group on foot and mouth disease that was established by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, advised that from 11 May individuals could be allowed access to land for recreational activities such as hill walking subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the expert group recommended that footwear should be cleaned and disinfected before and after use, dogs must be kept under effective control at all times and direct contact with susceptible animals must be avoided. In the light of this advice, I was able to announce the re-opening to the public of the national parks in Killarney, Connemara, Glenveagh, Wicklow and the Burren with effect from that date. The Phoenix Park was also re-opened to the public for recreational purposes. Access to practically all of the national monuments and nature reserves, <Col N="278" /> which are managed by Dúchas where a guide service is not provided, is now possible. The exceptions are sites where access is through private land, where consent of landowners is necessary. It is essential that visitors to the sites comply with the procedures recommended by the expert group in order to prevent any further outbreak of the disease in the State.</P>
    <P>The sites with a guide service are promoted in the Heritage Sites of Ireland brochure, which is published by the education and visitor services division of my Department. A national edition and seven regional editions of the brochure are published. Some 325,000 copies of the national brochure are distributed to the regional tourism authorities. Some 160,000 copies of the national brochure in French, German, Spanish and Italian are distributed to Bord Fáilte offices overseas. The brochure is also available at the individual sites. Some 200,000 copies of the regional editions of the brochure are also distributed. A website, heritageireland.ie, provides information on the opening times of the sites in six different languages. I am satisfied the sites managed by my Department are adequately promoted. I understand that a national promotional campaign of all tourist attractions, including the sites managed by my Department, is being undertaken by my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news from the Minister that all the national parks are open again and I acknowledge the measures being put in place to promote the use of those national parks. The Minister described the measures as adequate. I put to her that people's livelihoods depend on the traffic through the national parks and that there is a need for further measures to encourage and develop more business in the short to medium term to make good the shortfall to operators in the tourism sector who are an important support to the full exploitation of these assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly correct in saying heritage tourism forms an important part of the tourism sector and perhaps will become more important in future years. My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, is ensuring that there will be a national promotional campaign for the all the attractions, including sites managed by my Department. In fact, he made a very positive statement yesterday, where further moneys were being made available to deal with these promotions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, that national parks are a major tourist attraction. In my county, as the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, would understand, Glenveagh attracts about 100,000 visitors per annum. It will be very difficult to reach these figures this year due to the fact that these parks have just been recently reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Following the Cabinet meeting in Killarney yesterday, we understand that £2 million has been allocated towards the promotion of tourism in Ireland. I suggest that a significant percentage of that money should be devoted to promoting national parks and heritage areas and sites which have suffered as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed in news reports last night on the question of tourism seemed to be very positive and obviously I am pleased at that. The Government dealt with the foot and mouth disease crisis immediately when it arose to ensure that all precautions were taken in the hope that the disease would not spread. As a result, we have a happy story to tell at this time of the year when perhaps it is most important that we are able to open up the countryside for further visitors.</P>
      <P>On the promotion and marketing of these sites, it is, first, the preserve of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to decide on how the promotional campaign will be run but I will certainly have a word with him. I know that he will include the national parks in his campaign to promote our tourism attractions. As the Deputies stated, they obviously play an important part in tourism, both in the local areas and regionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that general tourism measures are being put in place by her colleague but I still put it to the Minister that there is a need for a more focused approach from her Department.</P>
      <P>How many animals in national parks were slaughtered as part of the foot and mouth disease prevention policy and what were the species?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly get that information for the Deputy. As he will be aware, the main concern was around the Cooley area because of the outbreak there. The susceptible animals were deer in particular. Happily the crisis did not escalate because of the tremendous efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, in particular, to ensure that every suspect case of foot and mouth disease was dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to promote the sites. As I stated, we do so on an ongoing basis anyway through the education and visitor services division of my Department. Obviously that takes a great deal of time and effort. As I stated in my initial reply, this information is made available in a number of European languages and on the website. We will work with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure there is further promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some contrasting images in today's newspapers. In one newspaper we see the Taoiseach and his colleagues toasting themselves with champagne in Killarney and elsewhere we see the citizens of Drumconrath in County Meath, the constituency of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, displaying drinking water, the quality of which is so bad that one Fianna Fáil Deputy &ndash; from the same constituency as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government &ndash; compared it to a cattle dose. Given the ongoing deterioration in the quality of water in our rivers and lakes which has been highlighted in the EPA millennium report and as the Government is in flagrant breach of European Union legislation in this area, will the Taoiseach agree the time has come for the Government to take action to improve the quality of drinking water which is bad in many parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will refer to the 14 other areas of dramatic failure for which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible in this House and indicate what action he proposes to take to deal with his 15 failures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is working efficiently towards the implementation of the national development plan all over the country through water and sewage schemes, on which about £3 billion is being expended. Most communities are beginning to see the benefits of it and will continue to see them. Where we have been in breach of any EU directives, the Minister has clearly indicated his plans to deal with them. Up to a few years ago, there were hundreds if not thousands of applications for improved water schemes. At least we are now successfully working towards a plan to deal with those. Over the period of the national development plan, we will deal with these to the best of our ability. I am sure that the expenditure of £3 billion will improve the standard and quality of our water as well as significantly improving health and other related issues.</P>

      <P>I will not rise to that particular bait. However, I will ask the House again to commend the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for working diligently through an enormous improvement programme relating to water, sewerage and drainage schemes that were long awaited. I know there are some court breaches and there are some difficulties in that. Deputies Noonan and Quinn will be aware of that because those cases were taken when they were in the Cabinet. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is now trying to deal with those issues as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the decision of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in respect of the Loughgall killings where it found that the British authorities had failed to provide an independent inquiry into the nature of those killings and so were indicted before the court and having regard to a case relating to Dean Lyons that will be highlighted this evening on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, is the Government now convinced of the necessity to bring in legislation as a matter of urgency to provide for an independent Garda ombudsman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach report progress on the High Court case over the Abbeylara inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is studying the judgment. He has already said he will make changes to the Garda Complaints Act. In relation to Loughgall, while the European Court of Human Rights did not make any statement about the circumstances, it did comment in quite critical fashion about the subsequent investigation, or lack of investigation, that it called unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made comment about Abbeylara earlier today, which I can repeat. The Government has decided that legislation may be needed and we are preparing that in draft form. However the case is in court today and we want to see the judgment from the court. As soon as we get a finding from the court we will have to see if legis<Col N="286" /> lation is necessary and, if so, that will be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that people in glass houses cannot afford to throw stones? The clear precedent established in the European Court's judgment with respect to the Loughgall killings makes it absolutely imperative that we move as a matter of urgency to establish a clear independent system of inquiry into Garda complaints. If we do not do so immediately, or if we are not seen to do so immediately, current and future inquires could well be subject to the same legal challenge that people in Northern Ireland brought in Strasbourg against the British Government in relation to the method of inquiry and the manifest lack of independence. Before a similar case is initiated in this country, it behoves us now to clearly indicate that we intend not to amend the existing legislation but to bring forward clear new proposals that would put the independence of any such Garda appeals system beyond any doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what Deputy Quinn is saying; he has stated this before. I would not like to think that the remedies here would be the same as in Northern Ireland. In the case of Abbeylara or anywhere else, I do not think there has been any lack of action by the Garda. Admittedly it is not an ombudsman&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are investigating themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Their practice has been to take a senior officer from another unit and district to investigate the matters. Perhaps that is not satisfactory and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that a level of independence is required. He has said that he will examine the recent judgment and also the case for having an inspectorate to deal with these issues. I hope he will soon bring forward his proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that so far the debate on the Water Services Bill has been on supply rather than conservation measures? Will this Bill redress that balance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I can do that. I want to also ask about the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill. This is the responsibility of the same Minister and publication is expected in early 2002. Does the Taoiseach accept that that would need to be fast tracked given the chaos in Dublin and the difficulties in outer suburban areas where car parking at train stations is causing chaos?</P>

    <Col N="287" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The water services Bill is to consolidate and update the water services legislation. The heads of the Bill are expected this summer but the legislation will not be available until next year. When the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill was launched about two months ago it was stated that there would be a period for public consultation. That period is nearly over at which point the Minister will start to draft the Bill.</P>

The order for the Health Insurance Bill is before the Dáil. I have no wish to disrupt or delay the passage of that legislation. If the Minister will not make a statement in the House, will he ask the chairman of the Laffoy Commission to appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children to explain why two members of the commission&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Human Rights Commission Bill is on the Order Paper for this session. It purports to establish, in Irish law, the European Convention on Human Rights and to address defects in the existing Human Rights Commission Act. The Minister indicated yesterday that he is thinking of splitting up those two objectives because he cannot get the full Bill through the House this session. Can I ask the Taoiseach if there will be a short Bill simply to put the Human Rights Commission on a proper statutory basis? I assure him that if such a short Bill is introduced, my party will facilitate its expeditious passage so that the commission can get on with its good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I refer to a statement, which no doubt the Taoiseach will have received, that the Minister for Health and Children either consciously or unconsciously misled the House in relation to a very seriously ill cancer patient. Will the Taoiseach ensure that the record of the House is put right? In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister indicated that a Ms Jeanette Byrne had asked for her treatment to be <Col N="290" /> deferred. That is simply not the case. This woman was denied treatment. It is important that the record of the House is corrected. Is the Taoiseach willing to address this issue in the interest of this patient who has been very badly treated? </P>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Tánaiste stated recently, in response to an OECD report &ndash; I am not sure if she had Cabinet approval &ndash; that she would address the issue of regulating pharmacies and that she expected deregulation to occur by the end of this year.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> This Bill is the necessary follow-up to the financial resolution on motor tax rates which was passed by the House on the 8 March 2001. As Deputies are aware, the financial resolution has only limited statutory effect and is required to be replaced by a Bill which provides a permanent legal base. The provisions of the Bill before the House are the same as those contained in the financial resolution with the addition of a provision to vary fees for full driving licences by regulation and also a provision relating to administration of the local government fund. The financial resolution essentially amended the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, in relation to rates of motor taxation. In general, with some exceptions, the financial resolution increased motor tax rates by between 4% and 6%.</P>
    <P>As I indicated during the debate on the financial resolution, the rebalancing of motor tax which I am proposing will &ldquo;green&rdquo; motor tax somewhat. That is not to say that motor tax is, of itself, a green tax. Nevertheless, we can configure the motor tax code to give it a greener bias, which will hopefully have positive environmental effects. On this basis, lesser increases in motor tax will apply to cars with smaller capacity engines which, as a general rule, do not use as much fuel as larger cars and, accordingly, create less harmful environmental side effects, particularly carbon dioxide emissions. The changes in motor tax rates provided in the financial resolution, and again set out in the Bill before the House, are already in place having come into force on 1 April 2001. Not all motor tax rates have been increased and some have been decreased. I will refer to this later.</P>
    <P>By way of background, motor tax is collected by local authorities and paid directly by them into the local government fund which was established under the Local Government Act, 1998. As well as the proceeds of motor taxation, the fund is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution which is increased each year at least in line with inflation. It is primarily used to finance non-national road grants and general purpose block grants for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities' current expenditure is met from a range of sources. In 2001, local authority current expenditure, estimated at £2.1 billion, will be financed as follows. Specific State grants, e.g. non-national road grants and higher education grants, will amount to about £559 million or 26.6% of income; local commercial rates will generate about £518 million, which is about 24.7% of total income; local charges and fees for goods and services, which will amount to about £586 million or 27.9%, and, finally, general purpose grants amounting to £436 million or 20.8% of current income. General purpose grants, financed from the local government fund, are an important source of local authorities' funding, representing about a fifth of total local current income. They are discretionary and may be used by authorities for funding whatever day to day operations they <Col N="294" /> consider necessary without any strings attached from my Department.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, such operations span a wide spectrum covering a multitude of areas such as housing, roads, water and sewerage, planning, the natural environment, recreation and amenities, community development and so on.</P>
    <P>Given its range of functions, local government is facing cost increases on a wide range of fronts. If local authorities are to meet the demands being placed on them, clearly they must be adequately resourced. In addition to their usual scale of operations, local authorities have responsibility for delivering on large elements of the national development plan. It is imperative, therefore, that they have sufficient financial resources available to deliver this work. While much of the capital costs of the NDP will be met by the Exchequer, significant downstream costs will arise for authorities in terms of operation and maintenance of the projects and schemes. Additional resources which arise from changes in motor tax rates will help local authorities to meet their commitments in this regard and to provide more and better quality services to the community. The local government fund is also used to finance non-national road grants and additional resources brought about by the increases in motor tax will also allow work to continue on improving the non national road network.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, new motor tax rates apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2001. As regards private cars, three different rates of increase are provided, depending on engine size. There is a 4% increase for cars up to 1100cc. This represents an annual rate increase of between £4 and £6. There is a 5% increase for cars from 1101 cc to 1500cc, which translates into annual increases of between £8 and £10 and a 6% increase for cars of 1501cc and over. These increases will range from £15 per annum at the lower end of this bracket to £51 for cars over 3091cc.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed in the Bill cannot be considered excessive. It is interesting to note that almost two thirds of all cars are under 1500cc and will, therefore, be only subject to annual increases of between £4 and £10, or between just 8p and 19p a week. A standard across the board 6% increase is provided for goods vehicles. At the minimum goods vehicle rate, which incidentally is paid by over four fifths of commercial vehicle owners, this represents an annual increase of £10, or less than 20p per week.</P>
    <P>A revision of motorcycle tax rates is proposed to reflect the different engine sizes of these vehicles. The single rate of £22 is being replaced by the three tax bands, which existed prior to 1992. The new rates vary between £25 for motorcycles under 75cc to £45 for motorcycles over 200cc.</P>
    <P>In motor tax law, there is a motor tax class that includes vehicles constructed specifically for the conveyance of a built-in machine or workshop and this class would include recovery vehicles. In <Col N="295" /> motor tax law parlance, such vehicles are known as contrivances. Outside of recovery vehicles which collect disabled vehicles, this class includes cranes, well-boring machines and fish and chip vans. These vehicles, like goods vehicles, are designed and constructed for the carriage of various items in the course of trade or profession. As such, these vehicles are being brought into line with the goods vehicle class and their rate is increased to the new goods vehicle minimum of £170.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for a 6% increase in respect of agricultural tractors. The rate for non-agricultural or general haulage tractors is being aligned with the minimum goods vehicle rate given the type of use to which such vehicles are put. The Bill also provides for average increases of 12% for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles. While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles.</P>
    <P>Two new motor tax classes are being introduced under this Bill. The first of these is a class covering all vehicles, irrespective of whether they are private vehicles or goods vehicles, which are used exclusively on an offshore island to which there is no direct road or bridge access from the mainland. A reduced rate of just £52 per annum is provided for this class. This reduction is in recognition of the limited use of such vehicles and that some owners require a vehicle both on an island and on the mainland. The reduced rate will not apply to vehicles on islands such as Achill or Valentia which are connected to the mainland.</P>
    <P>The second new tax class comprises all vehicles which are used exclusively for mountain and cave rescue purposes. This tax class is being established to exempt this class of vehicle from motor tax altogether. Vehicles used exclusively for transporting lifeboats, ambulances, fire brigade vehicles and State owned vehicles are already exempt from motor tax. Exempting this new class of vehicle for motor tax purposes completes a motor tax exemption for all emergency vehicles.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, one of the primary reasons for rebalancing motor tax rates is to reflect their impact on the environment. As a greening measure, no increases are proposed for public service vehicles such as buses, taxis, hackneys, youth and community buses and school buses, and electric vehicles are also being exempted from any increases in motor tax rates.</P>
    <P>While not covered by the Bill, I mentioned during the debate in the House on the financial resolution that as a measure to assist people who may face difficulty in taxing their cars on a full year basis, regulations were being introduced to provide for a reduction in the surcharge which applies to vehicles which are taxed half yearly and quarterly. As with increases in motor tax rates, <Col N="296" /> these regulations came into effect on 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, driving licence fees have been regarded as an excise duty under the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, as amended by the Finance Act, 1989. As such they could be varied, as desired, in the annual budgetary process through an amendment of the Finance Act. The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, provided that driver licence duties were to be paid into the Local Government (Equalisation) Fund and the Local Government Act, 1998, provided that such duties would be paid into the local government fund. In the light of these changes, it is considered that it would be more appropriate that driving licence fees be set otherwise than in the Finance Act. The Bill makes provision for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to set the driving licence fee. It is proposed that the fee can be set by regulation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, has on a number of occasions in reply to parliamentary questions indicated that arising from a review of the overall driving licence fee arrangements carried out by my Department, it is proposed to introduce more equitable licence fee arrangements for persons aged more than 70 years. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, indicated that amending legislation would be required to implement this change and undertook that such legislation would be implemented as soon as practicable. The current Bill provides the necessary legislative vehicle. Following the enactment of the Bill, it is the intention that the regulatory changes introducing more equitable licence fee arrangements for persons aged more than 70 years will be proceeded with promptly. I am not sure whether I should declare an interest, but both my parents are over 70 years just in case somebody raises it.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, given that motor tax proceeds are paid into the local government fund for local authority use, costs incurred by my Department in connection with the collection of motor tax are recoupable from the local government fund. A similar provision existed in relation to the operation of the equalisation fund. In addition to motor tax, fees from driver licences and some other minor miscellaneous fees and duties are paid into the fund for distribution to local authorities. Although such fees are paid into the fund, neither the Local Government Act, 1998, nor its predecessor dealing with the equalisation fund, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, specifically refer to the recoupment from the fund of costs associated with the administration of these fees. As with the costs associated with the collection and administration of motor tax, it is considered that the same provisions should apply in respect of driver licences and section 7 of the Bill provides for this. In any event, in practice in many cases, the same staff are involved in the same work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> With the introduction of the euro notes and coins from 1 January 2002, the Bill provides the euro rates of motor tax. The euro amounts were arrived at by dividing by the euro convertor &ndash; 0.787564 &ndash; and disregarding any cents. This approach not only ensures that motor tax offices continue their practice of handling whole units of currency but will result in a reduction in motor tax to all customers. Savings vary from under a euro for annual renewals to one euro plus for half year applications and one to three euro for quarterly renewals.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for minimal increases in motor tax rates which are below inflation rates. The income generated by these increases will not only improve the capacity of local authorities to provide a quality service to its consumers but will also contribute to an improvement in the quality of the environment by encouraging the use of smaller capacity cars. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the ever increasing cost of providing new roads and maintaining existing ones and, therefore, I have no fundamental objection to paying road tax or to fairly modest increases in road tax. Most people would accept that road users should make a direct contribution to the cost of maintaining roads over and above the contribution they pay through general taxation. Anyone who has anything to do with local authorities recognises the major demands being made on local authorities in all areas but especially in the areas of providing roads, maintaining non-national roads, secondary roads, tertiary roads and footpaths, the control of road openings and the costs associated with that, road sweeping, road safety and other demands being made on local authorities in terms of housing construction programmes under the Planning and Development Act and under those aspects of the national development plan that fall to the local authorities to deliver. Local authorities are literally groaning under the weight of these additional demands. With the increase in population the public are demanding higher standards of services from everybody, including public servants and local authorities.</P>
      <P>I want to put to bed the notion that this is a green tax. I am pleased the Minister softened his cough somewhat in that regard. He said this measure will green motor tax somewhat, which is a long way from what he claimed in March when he suggested in a press statement that we should be almost dancing in the streets with delight because such a wonderful green tax would be introduced. As politicians, we should not make such statements as it only increases public cynicism when we try to deceive people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, a green tax is a tax on ownership, but this is a fixed tax which will have the exact opposite effect. It will not reduce usage, as people will feel guilty about the initial outlay and will try to justify the expense by using their cars more often and spread the fixed cost <Col N="298" /> over a greater number of miles. With our onerous vehicle registration taxes, if fixed taxes had any impact on reducing usage, there would not be a single car on our roads and we would not have any traffic problems. This is a good old fashioned revenue raising tax and there is nothing wrong with that as taxes have to be raised, but it should not be dressed up as anything else. We should not pretend it is not part of general taxation and that it has nothing to do with it, given that it has everything to do with it.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the resolution in March, the Minister spoke about the importance of boosting the flow of income to the local government fund to help meet the cost of the increased demands on local authorities. If the Minister expected this measure to have an impact on reducing car ownership or car usage, it would be illogical to expect an increase in the flow of income into the local government fund, as one would then be seeking to increase expenditure from a fund that was diminishing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was genuinely concerned about the environment, he would batter down the door of his ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, and ask that she sanction the provision of more buses for all urban areas. Dublin Bus will not get any new buses this year, yet every Minister, even those who do not represent urban areas, must know that there is a traffic jam stretching from the front and back gates of Leinster House in all directions for up to almost 70 miles every day. The Minister for Public Enterprise is denying licences to private bus companies on the most spurious of grounds and no other Minister is doing anything about that, yet she will not sanction the provision of additional buses to Dublin Bus. Restricted conditions attach to the few licences that have been issued, such that drivers are not allowed to pick up or drop passengers where they want to. It is an awful spectacle in a city that is almost grinding to a halt to see half empty buses passing by people waiting pathetically at bus stops for buses that rarely ever come.</P>
    <P>While I am referring to a public transport issue, it is very much related to the Minister's brief. I remember being in Malahide when the Minister launched the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin and he asked that Dublin absorb approximately 20,000 additional houses every year for the next few years. If he wonders why those houses have not been built, that is partly due to the lack of transport. Almost without exception, every objection to planning applications for housing is traffic related. The public, with good reason, have lost confidence that the Minister or any other member of the Government will do anything to promote or provide modes of sustainable public transport. It falls to the Minister, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to encourage the Minister for Public Enterprise to get her finger out in terms of issuing licences. If she will not approve the provision of additional buses, she should at least issue licences to allow others to provide buses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> This is not a green tax or a local tax, even though the Minister has often tried to promote it as a local tax. If it were a local tax, it would be spent where it is collected and local authority areas in which there are many cars, such as mine, would be one of the richest counties instead of being one of the poorest. Although this tax is collected locally, it is centrally controlled and distributed according to some formula that nobody has ever mastered or understood. It is an unknown and arcane formula and militates against urban and city councils and thus urban areas. If the Minister genuinely wanted to reduce emissions, he would address the area of public transport.</P>
    <P>When a new tax is introduced in a budget by the Minister for Finance, some attempt is made to indicate how much will be collected under it. The Minister did not indicate the revenue that it is expected will be generated by this increase in the tax. This tax generated approximately £370 million last year, which is a great deal of money. Has this increase in the taxation, which was charged from April, been factored into the allocations to local authorities for 2001 or as a result of this increase can they expect higher increases than in previous years in the allocations for tertiary road grants, which are normally announced during the summer? I am not sure if that will be the case, but irrespective of that I plead with the Minister to consider significantly increasing the grant levels to urban local authorities, which even though they may not be designated as urban local authorities are becoming increasingly urban in nature.</P>
    <P>The local authority in my area receives no footpath grant whatsoever and pathetically low tertiary road grants, even though 95% of its population live in housing estates and have footpaths and public lighting outside their doors and all the operational and maintenance costs that go with that kind of high density living. The pounding of traffic on a daily basis increases maintenance costs. The same applies in all Dublin local authorities, including local authorities in many other counties where increased urbanisation spills out from town centres into county councils which do not have the same rate base as urban councils and corporations. In many older areas, particularly areas that were built more than 30, 40 or 50 years ago, including estates in my constituency, there has been no road maintenance since before 1987. The roads are subsiding and footpaths are crumbling and it does not make economic sense not to maintain them. Reconstruction work is required. It is very difficult to justify not repairing footpaths for elderly people when we are spending limitless millions of pounds on motorways. If there is to be a bonus for local authorities, I ask the Minister to direct it to where it will make a real difference to people's lives in their local areas.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the financial resolution my colleagues and I raised the anomaly surround<Col N="300" /> ing the issue of taxing electronically assisted bicycles. While the Minister promised to deal with the issue, no attempt has been made to deal with it in the Bill. Taxing these bicycles is as ludicrous as taxing a child's pram. Indeed, on occasions I have seen children's prams being used as offensive weapons. This is exactly the kind of transport mode the Minister should encourage. They are emission free and noise free and much safer than conventional mopeds or bicycles because they have a cut off speed. I was speaking to someone recently who said that he would cycle to town on an ordinary bike at 37 m.p.h. while these bikes have a cut off speed of 25 m.p.h. Given that we are spending enormous amounts of money on cycle paths, surely we should encourage people to use them because it is frightening how little they are used.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing age range of the population, people should have an option of using cycling as a method of recreation or commuting to work. Older people like myself might even be tempted to use the bike but might need a little help on hills. As these bikes might be a little more interesting than traditional cycles, they might attract younger people who are taking to those ghastly noisy mopeds and, worse, to motorbikes, which could not be a more dangerous mode of transport, apart from the emissions and noise impact on the environment.</P>
    <P>In other countries electrically assisted bikes are not subject to motor tax. Their use is encouraged. What worries me is that if these bikes are subject to motor tax, they are also subject to motor insurance and the carrying of number plates. Some countries have abolished import tax on them, while others give a 50% grant to people to buy them because they consider them so desirable. It is daft for us to tax them. I realise that the law is turning a blind eye to such bikes on the road but this puts the Minister and anyone involved in an accident in an invidious position. It is wrong not to match the legislation with the application of the law on the ground. I ask the Minister to consider this aspect because it is a dilemma which will not go away. I will be tabling an amendment but the Minister may be in a better position to deal with the issue by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>I must warn the Minister that I will table an amendment to section 7 on Committee Stage. I may be suspicious by nature but it seems the local government fund was set up and ring-fenced precisely to be a local government fund and to prevent Ministers from dipping into it when the need arises. I may be wrong but I suspect this is an attempt to dip into the fund for something other than that for which it was set up. As far as I am concerned, the fund was set up for a certain purpose. It may be inadequate and nothing other than a ring-fenced fund for the optics that road tax is going to local authorities. However, it is the thin edge of the wedge if the Minister starts to dip into it for other uses. While the Minister says this is to do with the administration of the licens<Col N="301" /> ing system for drivers, the reality is that an awful lot of money needs to be spent on the whole area of ongoing driver education and licensing. However, I am determined that money will not come out of the local government fund. Road safety is a national issue which must be funded by the Exchequer. I am putting the Minister on notice that I will not support anything that puts even a little chink in the armour of that ring-fenced local government fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure which will facilitate the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in reducing the cost of licence fees for people aged over 70. This was a very onerous aspect in many cases, particularly as it was accompanied by a need to get expensive medical certificates over a certain age. This is a welcome provision in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an amazing habit of making the most grandiose claims for what are often very mundane initiatives. He has lived up to that reputation in his presentation of this rather modest Bill. He says his proposals will green motor tax somewhat. I think it is more somewhat than green. He states that as a greening measure no increases are proposed for public service vehicles such as buses, taxis, hackneys, youth and community buses, school buses and electric vehicles. When the Bill is passed, I can see the flock of motorists leaving their cars to take public transport because 4% or 6% will not be applied to taxis, hackneys and buses.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of how little the Government has done to green taxes that this modest measure should be offered to the House as a green measure. It is nothing of the kind. It proposes a modest increase in the levels of motor taxation to which I stated the Labour Party had no particular objection when the motion was discussed some time ago. I have some concerns in relation to the Bill. The first was already referred to by Deputy Olivia Mitchell. It relates to section 7 of the Bill in which the Minister proposes to take from the local government fund what are called &ldquo;expenses incurred by the Minister in connection with the collection of motor vehicle tax&rdquo;. In the two respective subsections of that section he proposes to make this raid on the local government fund retrospective in one case to 1 January 1998 and in another case to 1 January 1997. I will oppose that section on Committee Stage. Deputy Mitchell pointed out that when the local government fund was established it was done on a ring-fenced basis. This is the first assault we have had on the local government fund by the Minister. I do not see any point in it. As he made clear in his own contribution, the local government fund is made up of the revenue collected in motor taxation plus a contribution from the Exchequer. Why there should be an attempt to recoup expenses incurred in relation to the collection of motor taxation and driving licence fees baffles me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the explanatory memorandum, which normally tells us if there are costs associated with particular legislation, makes no <Col N="302" /> reference at all as to whether there is any cost to the Exchequer in relation to this particular Bill. Since it is silent on the matter it is clear that what is intended here by way of a raid on the local government fund is a revenue raising measure. It is doubly unacceptable because it is the Minister himself who will decide by regulation what the level of the driving licence fee will be. It is also, in the event of any difficulty arising as to what constitutes expenses in connection with the collection of motor tax or the driving licence fee, the Minister who will be the arbiter of any dispute. I intend to return to that on Committee Stage and, as I have indicated, I intend to oppose that section because I see it as a raid by the Minister on the local government fund.</P>
    <P>The second reservation that I have in relation to the Bill &ndash; I want to echo comments I made when these proposals were in motion form earlier this year &ndash; has to do with the way the local government fund is distributed and the lack of accountability for this fund. The vast majority of the people who pay motor tax, who are by definition the contributors to the local government fund, live in housing estates in urban areas where the roads and footpaths are literally falling apart. The worst roads in this country are to be found in the various housing estates in urban areas. Many of those roads were built 20 or 30 years ago by &ldquo;spec&rdquo; builders who often paid little attention to the quality of the road they were putting down. These roads are now falling apart. They are in a critical state and the level of financial assistance available to local authorities to do anything with them is quite minuscule.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister when he made the road grant allocations for this year he referred to these urban roads. In a section of his press release on 5 February 2001 he said that urban roads must not be neglected either and that the users of urban roads also deserve good quality roads. That is true although the use of language in his statement is a giveaway. It seems to me that urban roads, the roads in housing estates, are treated very much as the also-rans when it comes to the allocation of moneys for the upgrading and maintenance of roads.</P>
    <P>In the 2001 allocation, for example, only £19.1 million has been allocated to urban authorities for their non-national roads and that is out of a total allocation of £319 million, in other words, just 6% was allocated to urban authorities for the upgrading and maintenance of non-national roads. Let us look at the major urban centres. For example, in Dublin city the allocation to Dublin Corporation is less than £17 million out of a total allocation of £319 million, about 5% of the total allocation. If we take the entire greater Dublin area, the four authorities of Dublin City, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, the total allocation is £40 million out of the total of £319 million. In other words, a little over 12% of the total allocation of roads money is going to the area which has about 30% of motor car registrations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> I said before when this was in motion form that I accept that the allocation of moneys for roads and the general allocation of moneys to local authorities from the local government fund cannot be exclusively on a <i>per capita</i> basis but I do not accept a regime where it appears to be virtually exclusively on a per kilometre basis, irrespective of whether it is a little used road in some part of the country or a highly used road in an urban area. The day is approaching when the people who pay motor tax will look at the roads in their immediate area and they will wonder what they pay their motor tax for. It is essential that there is some rebalancing of the way the local government fund is distributed and how the non-national roads allocation, which comes from the local government fund, is distributed in order to provide a reasonably decent quality of road for people who pay the road tax for the roads in the areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>This would not be an issue, and none of us would complain very much about the proportionate distribution of road grants and the local government fund, if it were not for the fact that the roads concerned are in an appalling state. Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred earlier to the quality and standards of the footpaths and I agree with her. They now cost local authorities large amounts of money, not for repair and maintenance but for claims from people, particularly elderly people, who fall and injure themselves on broken footpaths. It is a problem that must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>I referred before to the disproportionate way in which the local government fund itself is allocated. A look at the distribution of the local government fund shows that, <i>per capita</i>, those in south Dublin receive £54.75, those in Galway city £76, Waterford city £79 and Dublin city £80. At the other end of the spectrum, County Leitrim receives £228.76 <i>per capita</i>, County Longford £199.23 and County Roscommon £172.98.</P>
    <P>We have to discuss seriously the basis on which the local government fund is allocated, a demand I made in a meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government. The local government fund comprises the proceeds of motor taxation and a contribution from the Exchequer. This House should be given the fund's annual account, including details of what goes in and out of the fund and how allocations from it are made. We need to discuss the criteria used to distribute the local government fund. I am aware that a study of needs and resources was carried out on behalf of the Department by Galway County Council. The study reflects the priorities of that county council, which I understand.</P>
    <P>The means of allocation of the local government fund remain unsatisfactory. There must be public discussion in this House of how the fund is divided among local authorities so that we know the criteria that are used. I have looked at the study of needs and resources but I cannot find a <Col N="304" /> list of criteria. Issues that should be included in such a list include the social problems within the area covered by the local authority. Attention must be paid to the State management of the kind of problems that have to be dealt with by local authorities managing large housing estates in urban areas as such problems are not taken into account when moneys are being distributed from the local government fund. The need to provide and maintain community and recreational facilities in large urban areas is not taken into account as allocations are made.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes relatively modest increases in motor taxation and the resultant money will find its way into the local government fund. This House needs to address what is happening to the local government fund, how it is being accounted for, what happens to the motor taxation income that goes into it, how the fund is allocated among the various local authorities and how roads in different parts of the country are treated. I do not doubt that many motorists who will have to pay 4% or 6% extra for motor taxation, depending on the size of vehicle driven, are getting bad value. This applies especially in areas where most of the those who pay motor taxation live because the roads, footpaths and motor infrastructure in such areas are not properly maintained, they are rundown and substandard. Value for money paid by way of motor taxation is not being received.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, there are a number of areas in this Bill to which I intend to return on Committee Stage tomorrow. I do not object to the proposed increases in motor taxation but I have strong objections to the way the local government fund is being managed and the moneys from it allocated. It is something we have to return to in this House at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>In March, we discussed the tax that was proposed in the budget on 6 December 2000. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has told us that this motor tax is not a budgetary issue and is not part of taxation policy generally. Such comments ring hollow with motorists who have to pay a tax which we are told is not a tax. The Minister attempted to hide the tax involved by announcing it in the shadow of the budget last December. He attempted to slip it in after newspapers had gone to print that night and after the budget had been accepted and applauded by those involved in motoring, including the Automobile Association of Ireland. The tax has been described as a green tax in an effort to make people feel that they will benefit the environment by paying it. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, it is misleading to contend that this is a green tax as it is merely a method of collecting further revenue. I notice that the Minister's speech today did not confidently promote it as a green tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it is not a green tax as it will be based on the energy capacity of the car. A car manufactured today can be up to 20 times cleaner in terms of its emissions. I know the Minister referred to carbon dioxide emissions from smaller <Col N="305" /> cars, but a ten year old car may use more fuel than a newer, more environmentally friendly car that has been built to a higher standard. In the last ten or 15 years, the development of new technology like electronic injection systems, catalytic converters and multi-valve engines has contributed to the manufacture of low emission passenger cars. Light duty vehicle engines have enabled significant improvements in air quality in other European countries. Future developments will further enhance air quality.</P>
    <P>The EPA's Ireland's Environment: A Millennium Report noted that the quality of our air is continuing to deteriorate and blamed this on increases in traffic and transportation. A four litre diesel fuelled car has lower emissions than a ten year old small car, but this is not reflected in the Minister's proposals which focus on engine size. Nothing has been done to advance and promote newer, more environmentally friendly technologies. Motorists are not given incentives to purchase new cars and when buying new cars there is no focus on the environmental impact of engines. Certain engines will reduce emissions and thereby benefit air quality, but this has not been reflected with green taxation measures.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations from those in the motor industry on the importation of second hand cars from outside the EU. It is claimed that cars imported from such places have higher emission levels than cars with a similar engine capacity manufactured within the EU. We should be concerned about this and I would like to see it addressed. We have no idea what types of cars are being imported, what types of engines they have or what contribution they make to the already deteriorating air quality here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the additional moneys to be collected under this measure, while I support the notion of a motor tax going directly to support a fund to be reinvested in infrastructure for motorists, I would prefer to see more equity in the allocation of the local government fund. There are questions as to how this funding is allocated. I have here a copy of correspondence in that regard from the Cork county manager to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In it the county manager outlines that Cork County Council has carried out detailed analyses of the condition of the non-national road network in County Cork and of the non-national road grant allocations, which show that 53% of the network is substandard and would require £230 million at current prices to bring it up to standard &ndash; we are all aware of the rate of inflation that applies to road construction and road maintenance costs. He says that at the current rate of grant allocation, it will take from 14 to 22 years to bring these roads up to standard, assuming they do not deteriorate in the meantime.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the increases in allocation in recent years have covered cost increases only and that longer lengths of restoration are not being achieved. He refers to the fact that the <Col N="306" /> council has spent its own resources in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 to fund over-expenditure on the restoration programme rather than cut back on the length of restorations and that such expenditure was in addition to the present annual spend of £15.5 million of its own resources on the maintenance of the non-national road network. He further states that this assessment, taken in conjunction with the council's analysis of the published list of countrywide allocations, shows that Cork County Council is not receiving an equitable proportion of the national allocation and that at the current rate of allocations it will take approximately 19 years before the non-national road network in County Cork will be brought up to standard, assuming they do not deteriorate, but that the increase in traffic in county areas, many of which are large urban areas similar to developments outside Dublin, and the extreme weather we have experienced over recent winters have caused roads to deteriorate at an alarming rate. All the county council can do is patch them up in an effort to repair the damage. It can do nothing in terms of improving the quality of the road network. In those circumstances, 19 years is an optimistic estimate.</P>
    <P>The road network in Cork is the longest in the country. However, in terms of the allocation of non-national road grants, in 2000 it ranked 26th and in 2001 it ranked 24th. Sligo and Roscommon were behind Cork this year in terms of investment per kilometre of road. That is the extent to which our non-national road network has been allowed to deteriorate. It is ironic that a Fianna Fáil Government is proposing an increase in motor taxation, having abolished it in 1977. It is obvious that the reasons for the condition of the roads go back a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy remembers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember it well. I hear about it regularly at local authority meetings. Engineers point to it all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister before about the funding of county boroughs and urban corporations which have not received a fair share of funding for roads in their areas. This question was also raised by Deputy Gilmore. Such funding is meant to cover footpaths as well, but the condition of footpaths in many areas continues to deteriorate. Cork Corporation has found that its hands have been tied in terms of upgrading footpaths and it is leading to huge increases in costs in terms of public liability because of accidents, because of elderly people turning on their ankles and falling in these areas. The Minister is well aware of that. There was a report on this recently in my local authority area. County boroughs and corporations cannot get on top of the situation because many roads are deteriorating, public liability accounts for a large chunk of their budgets every year and costs seem to be continually escalating. Many roads in housing estates have not been <Col N="307" /> resurfaced since they were constructed in the 1970s and none of us is sure what the quality of construction was at that time. In the Cork area the situation is exacerbated by the fact that roads were built on marshland which tends to sink, and this affects the road surface.</P>
    <P>This is to be a local government fund, and everybody is concerned about how such a fund is allocated. I hope section 7, which empowers the Minister to use the moneys obtained from driving licence fees, will be clarified. The local government fund should be ring-fenced and the Minister should not be able to dip into it for the purpose of administering the licensing system. That money should be kept specifically for the local government fund as outlined. That is what it is intended for. Such funding is in short enough supply at present without taking further from it.</P>
    <P>This is an additional tax on the motorist. However, the more money people invest in keeping their cars on the road the more likely they are to try to get value for money and use them rather than using public transport. Investment in public transport is lacking. I questioned the Minister for Public Enterprise about investment in new buses in Cork. We are only replacing old, deteriorating quality buses, not increasing capacity. There has been no advance on park and ride facilities. The Minister for Finance included proposals in previous budgets to develop park and ride facilities but few of them have been taken up.</P>
    <P>Last week there was a picture of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, boarding the Luas bus in London. Where is the Luas? It will be two or three years before it is available. We are still looking at the construction holes in the road but there is no sign of Luas. There is no sign of anything to alleviate the problems experienced by commuters. There is talk of the metro and Luas but they are not built. What is to be done today and tomorrow to benefit the commuter? Where are the additional buses, bus corridors and park and ride facilities to encourage people to leave their cars at home and use public transport?</P>
    <P>Bus lanes are restricted to taxis and buses. Why not ask the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Dublin Transportation Authority to encourage a car pooling system whereby cars carrying two or three passengers can use a bus lane? People would be extremely interested in such a proposal. They would go out of their way to participate in such a system if they could use the bus lane. It works well in the United States. I always travel by bus in Dublin and when one stands at the bus stop all one can see is car after car carrying just one occupant. It would be a simple measure to open the bus lanes to car pools, particularly the bus lanes which caused controversy by taking over a car lane and squeezing motorists into just one lane. Car pooling is a simple measure that could be implemented immediately. It works satisfactorily in other countries and should be <Col N="308" /> considered here. I believe it would be extremely popular.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the Bill is that it is being promoted as an environment tax. It is not that but merely another method of collecting funds which, I hope, will be spent in a more open and equitable fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to address the House on this Bill. The Bill offers us the opportunity to tease out a number of issues. First, however, I will refer to two points I raised on 8 March when the House debated the financial resolutions. The first is the exemptions in section 3 of the Bill. At that time I proposed that the Minister consider exempting sub aqua clubs which provide an emergency service on inland waterways. They are part of the rescue services and should be given the same recognition as the other emergency services which are exempted.</P>
      <P>Sub aqua clubs do valuable work and are involved in search and rescue activities when there are drowning incidents, mainly on our inland waterways and lakes. They provide an excellent service. However, the vast majority of such clubs are run on local voluntary contributions. Members of the teams give voluntarily of their time to carry out searches. Many of the clubs are run on a shoestring. It has been suggested that the cost for an individual involved in a search is approximately £60 per day. If an extensive search is required, it can involve significant costs for both the local sub aqua club and the members of the club involved in the search and rescue operation.</P>
      <P>It is not possible in many cases for the Garda sub aqua team to be called in, due to the many demands placed on it. The fact that some members of the sub aqua team are now based with the Garda water unit in Athlone will further tie up the team. As a consequence, sub aqua clubs are usually the first port of call for local gardaí when a search and rescue operation is required. The members of these clubs are called out at short notice to carry out these operations. Their vehicles are not used on a full-time basis for emergency purposes but they provide an important service in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Clubs are also requested from time to time to cover safety events in water. This is an important service and the Minister will be aware of that. There is no inland water rescue service unlike on the coasts where there is the RNLI and the coastguard service. Sub aqua club vehicles are also used to transport equipment for non-emergency purposes and for social outings for diving. However, in many cases this is part of the ongoing training which takes place in sub aqua clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dolphin sub aqua club in Roscommon has made a submission on this issue to the Minister. The emergency telephone numbers of the club are printed on the side of the club's van should people believe there is a need to call its members out during an emergency. The Garda, the Civil <Col N="309" /> Defence and the fire service in Roscommon have the numbers to contact the sub aqua club in such emergencies.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problem that the sub aqua club members are not involved full time in these activities and that the system could be abused as a result. It must be feasible, however, for the local garda superintendent to certify that a sub aqua club is providing a much needed emergency service on inland waterways in the community and that the exemption is not being abused. We are not talking about a huge amount of money but an exemption which would give recognition to the work and commitment of these clubs in providing an emergency and search and rescue service all year round, especially given the number of people who use the inland waterways.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to review this matter and to discuss it with the Garda authorities. They could certify that the clubs provide this service and thereby give them an exemption from motor tax. It would be small but important recognition. I hope the Minister will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for this exemption.</P>
    <P>I also raised, in the context of the section 3 exemptions, the use of rapeseed oil. We should encourage the use of biofuels through a reduction in excise duties and motor tax on these vehicles. We will not meet our requirements under Kyoto in relation to emissions unless we encourage the use of biofuels and especially rapeseed oil, which could provide a cash crop for many farming communities. At present, farming is going through a difficult time, a subject to which I will return. This country is also subject to the volatility of the oil markets. We have the potential to develop rapeseed oil as a cash crop. The climate is suitable and the technology has been developed. Maxol has put significant investment into this technology.</P>
    <P>Ireland could be a leading nation and could lead by example in the development of biofuels. However, unless we are prepared to give this some form of encouragement through reductions in excise duties and motor taxes, that will not happen. It is a huge pity that we do not seize this opportunity now.</P>
    <P>One of last Sunday's newspapers reviewed the new biofuel Ford Focus which allows drivers to choose between petrol or LPG as a fuel source. It is currently being tested in the Irish market but to the best of my knowledge it is not recognised in the Bill or in the current motor tax regulations. LPG is an environmentally efficient fuel, with 80% less noxious emissions than other fuels, and meets with many of the criteria set down for emissions. The engine starts on petrol and then the LPG kicks in automatically, but again it is not given recognition in relation to taxation policy here. This is a measure that should be reviewed. The British Association of Biofuels and Oils has promoted biodiesel as a fuel of the future. Biodiesel engines are more costly to maintain and that <Col N="310" /> additional cost should be taken into consideration on excise duties and motor tax.</P>
    <P>The British Government reduced the cost of biodiesel by 20p per litre in its recent budget and Volvo recommends the use of low sulphur diesel, including a mix of rapeseed oil of 5%, yet we are not giving recognition to the use of biofuels when we have the potential to develop them as an economic industry to support agriculture and our environment. We have ignored the issue again today and it is a pity the Minister did not take note of this when it was proposed some weeks ago during the debate on financial resolutions regarding excise duty, which followed this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Regarding agriculture, the Minister said the Bill provides for a 6% increase in respect of agricultural tractors and that the rate for agricultural tractors or general haulage tractors is to be aligned with the minimum goods vehicle rate, given the type of use of such vehicles. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has told the House about the need for the general public to support agriculture given the foot and mouth crisis. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has told the House that we need to put support provisions in place and that he will review the farm assist scheme because of the huge financial pressure being put on farmers, yet the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is putting an extra 6% on the cost of motor tax for tractors. While that is not a huge amount of money, the principle is what we are talking about. We are talking about a Government that has pitied the farmers, saying they need support and that we have a farming crisis, yet today the same Government wants to increase motor tax on tractors. I cannot understand why one Department is saying one thing and another Department is doing the exact opposite, penalising the agricultural sector when it is under severe financial pressure. The Minister should review this section and reduce motor tax on tractors rather than increasing it. It is a contradiction in policy terms for the Government to increase agricultural costs at a time when that sector is going through such difficulties.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with licences. The Minister is talking about changing the mechanisms by which the fees are charged for licences. Regarding the new licensing mechanisms which were put in place over the past few weeks, we have now decided, ten years after the decision was made in the EU, to introduce a theory test. Will the Minister explain why he did not consider the introduction of a theory test for the 345,000 provisional drivers on our roads? There is no consideration for them regarding a theory test and this is a missed opportunity as the Minister could have gone to the insurance industry and said that he was introducing this on a voluntary basis for those 345,0000 provisional licence holders and that if they completed the theory test they would get a reduction in the cost of their insurance. That would be recognition for doing the theory test.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The Minister could have reviewed the situation and decided that this could not be imposed on those currently on a provisional licence but when that provisional licence was renewed, be it for one's second or fifth provisional licence, the theory test could be introduced at that point. The introduction of the theory test was discussed for the past ten years and a golden opportunity was missed to tie the insurance industry into it and give recognition to those who completed it by giving them a reduction in the cost of car insurance. Again, the Government has ignored the issue of car insurance, particularly for young drivers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's newspapers stated that rogue drivers are adding £57 to the cost of each insurance premium. I had hoped the Minister would deal with this issue when he brought in this legislation as it is important that motor tax and car insurance are tied together. We should have a proper national database of those drivers who have not paid their motor tax or insurance and are costing those who pay their insurance £95 million per annum. It is disappointing the Minister did not address this. He did not give us the up-to-date situation on the introduction of the national vehicle file, which is fundamental to tackling this problem. One can be sure that if £95 million is going towards motor insurance claims every year, many more people are avoiding motor tax every year as we do not have the systems in place to ensure that abuse is tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned reducing the cost of licences for older drivers and I had hoped he would consider introducing some training mechanism for older drivers. We suggested that eight months ago and I hope the Minister reviews the situation.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister in conscience increase road tax on cars, vans, lorries and tractors when the county road network throughout the country is deteriorating at a rate that will eventually lead to its complete disintegration? I need not remind the Minister of State, who comes from my own city by the Lee, of the serious consequences that may arise because of the road infrastructure in County Cork.</P>
      <P>There are roads in my constituency which have not had maintenance for the past 30 years, not a shovel of chips or a litre of tar. They have been left in abeyance and are deteriorating at such a rate that they will soon be extinct altogether. It is a shocking state of affairs that it is over 30 years since some county roads in Cork saw a shovel of chips or a litre of tar. That is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork County Council covers an area which is one eighth of the entire area of the State, yet County Cork has a lower rate per kilometre of <Col N="312" /> county road funding than any other county council in the country. The Minister boasted that he gave £24 million for such roads to Cork County Council but the county manager and county engineers state that Cork would need £240 million to meet county road demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not sincere when he states that this is a green tax. It has no trace of green in its substance, not even one of the 40 shades of green. It only digs deeper into the pockets of the already hard-pressed motorists. Surely it is clearly evident to the Minister that, unlike what he said at the outset, this is not a green Bill? If this is a green tax, do I take it from the Minister's speech that he will insist that the Taoiseach and all his Cabinet colleagues, including himself, will do away with their Mercedes and replace them with cars such as the Fiesta, Punto or Ka? Perhaps he has in mind insisting that the Dublin members of the Cabinet use Honda motorcycles on their way to Dáil Éireann, but he has not given any thought to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, who must travel 240 miles to Dublin. Will the general trend be that all Ministers will be reduced to using small cars?</P>

      <P>Yes, I drive an eight year old Mercedes because I do not have the price of a new one. I would probably be dead on the road from west Cork long ago only for the fact that I have been driving such a heavy car. The Minister must realise that the people are not driving Mercedes cars or good quality high-powered cars out of a sense of grandeur but out of necessity. All the road fatalities at present are caused by small cars involved in accidents which disintegrate like coke cans. Does the Minister want us to go back to using cars with the quality of coke cans? They do not have any idea about what is needed in Ireland nowadays.</P>
      <P>The Luas system was supposed to be launched in Dublin recently. Where is there evidence of the availability of that system in the city? Luas spelt backwards is Saul, and the Minister knows what happened Saul on the road to Damascus. If the Government is to get the Luas project off the ground, it will need a miracle like that which occurred on the road to Damascus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to be <i>au fait</i> with the situation. County Cork receives grants of £23 million per year for the county roads network. The county manager and the county engineer stated that we would need £230 million a year for the next ten years to bring our roads up to standard. My constituency does not have one mile of national primary roads, one mile of rail track or an airstrip. South-west Cork has no proper transport infrastructure, yet it is bigger than nine of the counties in Ireland. We have been completely neglected since our rail system was taken up 55 years ago and sold to a Third World country <Col N="313" /> where, according to reports I received this morning, it has run perfectly since. Surely the constituency of Cork South-West deserves recognition?</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident that there are many anomalies in this legislation. The Minister stated that there is a 4% increase for cars up to 1100cc, a 5% increase for cars from 1101cc to 1500cc and a 6% increase for cars of 1501cc and over. It seems he wants to reduce us to the use of mopeds or Mini Minors.</P>

I am not sure whether road tax is chargeable on ministerial cars in any event. I have not had the pleasure of using one yet, but one never knows what may happen in the future.</P>

      <P>The increase of 6% on tractors comes at a time when the farming community is in dire straits due to controls regarding the foot and mouth crisis and BSE. Having hardly earned a penny since new year's day, the Minister has saddled them with a 6% increase. At the same time the Minister has failed to provide decent laneways into farmers' yards and in County Cork there is a ten-year backlog in the local improvement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the biggest legislative cover-up I have ever seen. Either the Minister for Finance was afraid to introduce it in his budget speech or he deliberately refrained from doing so, but the Minister came into the Dáil the following morning, after making an announcement after midnight the night before that the Government was <Col N="314" /> increasing these taxes, and got it through harmoniously with the aid of the four Independent Deputies. I want the Minister to realise that he will no longer cod the public in this respect. The lives of the people are in his hands. He will be responsible for reducing the standard of cars in use in the future to that of coke cans.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to follow Deputy Sheehan who covered all the ground thoroughly. As a representative of the same region, I concur with what he said about the condition of our county road network. Perhaps it is not the most pertinent point of this legislation, but in dealing with any motor tax matter our constituents would think it remiss of us if we did not bring to the Minister's attention once again in the strongest way possible, as Deputy Sheehan did, the appalling condition of the roads in County Cork and throughout the country. This evening my colleague, Deputy Creed, will raise in the Adjournment debate the lack of road grants available to County Cork.</P>
      <P>A recent detailed study conducted by the county manager of Cork County Council paints a clear picture of a road network which needs substantial investment over the coming years to maintain them in their current condition. I hope when the Minister responds to Deputy Creed he will have some good news. At a time when the Celtic tiger economy still seems to be roaring strongly, according to this afternoon's welcome unemployment figures and the strong economic trends, our rural constituents find it extremely difficult to accept the appalling condition of the roads which they must use to drive to work or school every day.</P>
      <P>We could go back in history to 1977 when the decision was taken to abolish rates and motor tax. Since then the condition of the roads has gone from bad to worse. I hope the Minister will give serious attention, between now and the next budget, if he is still Minister for the Environment and Local Government or if the Government is still in place at that time, to putting a meaningful financial package together which will make a difference to the county roads network.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to &ldquo;green&rdquo; the motor tax system. If we were speaking about green taxes five or six years ago, most of our constituents would have had little interest in the subject. Fortunately, people have now become more aware and seriously concerned about the state of our environment, be it air or water quality, and they will listen. The huge environmental problems caused by car emissions can be seen daily in our cities and towns. A meaningful response from the Minister would be met with acceptance by the public. This proposal by the Minister is a very small step and it will make no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last budget was a missed opportunity. A carrot and stick approach is necessary when it comes to environmental matters. There should be a certain level of penalty coupled with tax incentives and allowances so that people are helped to <Col N="315" /> choose a more environmentally-friendly option. LPG was a relatively common motor fuel in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but it no longer seems to be a choice for a significant number of motorists. It is very clear that the use of LPG would be helpful for the environment. The Minister should avail of the opportunity which this Bill provides, or that provided by the budget, to give preference to fuels such as LPG which are less damaging to the environment. We need an urgent debate to examine what the Minister can do to improve the environment. The public is willing to respond and we need much greater action from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. A few years ago, during a debate on VRT, I suggested that there should be a concession on VRT for cars with a certain level of emissions, and this proposal is another way of doing that. Anything that helps the environment must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that I come from the premier tourism county in the country. The Minister was there yesterday and would have seen for himself the dependence of Kerry on tourism. I say without fear of contradiction that we must have the worst county road network in the country. That could once have been said about Cavan-Monaghan but it is now the case for Kerry. From the point of view of the Minister and his party's electoral strategy, it is vital that the problem of county roads in Kerry is addressed. The only solution is a substantial increase in funding.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department has asked the county engineer to up-date the five-year programme. This programme was initiated in 1995 and has been very successful. County councils are now able to review resources and implement proper plans for roads restoration work. This work needs to be accelerated and the next plan will require funding. I ask the Minister, when it comes to the allocation of extra funding, to respond generously to the needs of Kerry. We have a greater amount in miles of county roads than any other county in the country. Some of these roads have not been attended to in the past 25 or 30 years. I have travelled these roads and they are on the point of collapse. Unless the funding is provided, the problem will get worse. The contributions of motor tax from the county of Kerry puts it fifth or sixth in the list. An enormous amount of money is being taken from County Kerry in the form of motor tax and it is only right that the Minister should reciprocate by returning the contributions to Kerry motorists and by supplying additional funding.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite who have contributed to this debate. No Minister likes to introduce new taxes <Col N="316" /> or to raise existing ones, but any decision taken to raise taxes is obviously not taken very lightly by any Government. I assure Deputies that the decision was not taken lightly in this case either.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked whether this Bill is intended as a device to raise revenue or to &ldquo;green&rdquo; motor tax. The Bill will address both of these issues. It will not totally &ldquo;green&rdquo; the motor taxation system, we never said that it would, but we are biasing increases in favour of smaller cars. We did that initially in the first increases in motor tax in 1998, when in relation to VRT, there was a significant shift from higher engine size cars to lower engine size cars and we wish to continue that trend.</P>
      <P>Everyone has accepted the need for local authorities to have sufficient funds to meet their many obligations, and this provides one source of funding. The Exchequer grant to the local government fund is another method and I am pleased to announce that this year the total local government fund amounts to about £723.5 million, which is a substantial increase on the amount that was available in 1997.</P>
      <P>To reply to a question raised by Deputy Mitchell, in a full year the changes will provide £20 million. It is estimated that from April this year it will generate about £15 million. I am disappointed to note that Deputies opposite tried to convey the impression that this was sneaked in on the evening of the budget. I had occasion to take them to task about that previously. If members of Fine Gael are asleep or are not aware of what is happening at 6 p.m., perhaps that explains how they are faring in the polls.</P>

      <P>The press release came out at 6 p.m. and was available if people wished to look at it. The issue of the policy on motor tax was raised. It does not form part of taxation policy generally. Motor tax, unlike all other taxes, is not paid into the Exchequer because under the Local Government Act, 1998, it has to be paid directly into the local government fund. It is interesting that some people charge us with trying to sneak it in. The first time this change was made was in 1997 when the previous Government, under the local government equalisation fund, allowed for an increase. The legislation promulgated by that Government was completely outside the budget or the Finance Act agenda. This is a continuation of that procedure. The local government fund followed the equalisation fund and the same practices are applied. The proceeds of motor tax no longer go to the Exchequer and the practice is for changes in the motor tax regime to be dealt with outside the budget or the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the effect of motor cars on the environment and whether this is a green motor tax. Deputy Clune said diesel cars are more environmentally friendly than petrol cars, but that is not so. While diesel cars are more fuel efficient, they emit far more local pollutants <Col N="317" /> such as fine particles and hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. That should be noted.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the financial resolutions the question of taxing sub aqua vehicles used for emergency purposes was raised by Deputy Naughten. He repeated that request during this debate. He subsequently wrote to me and we exchanged correspondence. I indicated my willingness, subject to certain precautions, to introduce a change to facilitate that. The Irish Underwater Council, which is the national governing body of underwater sports in Ireland and represents over 80 clubs and 3,500 divers throughout the entire island, has written to me and drawn attention to a number of scuba diving clubs that have purchased vehicles to be used exclusively for the transport of search and recovery equipment. It requested an exemption from motor tax for vehicles used exclusively for under-water search and recovery purposes. I promised Deputy Naughten previously that once we had considered the matter I would bring forward a relevant amendment and I intend to do so on Committee Stage. Perhaps his colleagues opposite will convey that to him.</P>
    <P>A number of Cork Deputies pleaded their case in relation to the amount of money Cork County Council is receiving. Given that the matter is being raised on the Adjournment this evening, I do not want to pre-empt what may be said except to say that recently a sum of £27 million was allocated to Cork County Council for 2001. That is the highest allocation countrywide for non-national roads. The Cork Deputies will be interested to learn that since 1997 the allocations to Cork have increased by 80% from a base of £15.8 million.</P>

      <P>The question of electrically propelled vehicles was raised by a number of Deputies. In my approach to this Bill I recognised the case for mechanically propelled vehicles and I have not applied any motor tax increase to them, contrary to what may be thought. Apart altogether from the motor tax code, under Irish road traffic law electrically propelled vehicles are regarded as mechanically powered vehicles and are subject to legal requirements relating to the use of all mechanically propelled vehicles. Such vehicles must have proper brakes, lights and number plates and must be covered by third party motor insurance. The rider must have appropriate driver's licences and so on. All aspects of this type of vehicle are being evaluated in my Department with a view to introducing a less prescriptive regime under road traffic law. It will be appreciated that account will have to be taken of the road safety aspects involved.</P>
      <P>The case for reducing tax on electrically propelled vehicles is not an open and shut case by any means. While such vehicles do not give rise to CO2 emissions of themselves one has to bear in mind that due to inefficiencies in the generation process it may well be that on a life cycle basis such vehicles could conceivably have potentially higher CO2 emissions associated with them in terms of the use of fossil fuels in the generation of electricity. Nevertheless, Deputy Mitchell said she would table an amendment on Committee Stage. I look forward to discussing the matter in more detail at that stage. The Deputy indicated that in other countries there is no motor tax for these vehicles, but that is not so. In the UK, for example, there is a motor tax of £15 per annum.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a general comment on matters raised about the local government fund. There is a needs and resources model and money is allocated on the basis of that model. I indicated to Deputies previously that if my Department received an invitation to attend the committee to explain the needs and resources model, I would make officials available to do so. It is important that everyone has a full understanding of how equitable and fair the system is. The invitation still remains. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>&ndash;its neglect at providing significant job creation in the seven western counties, given that less than 10% of all job creation in the State in the last three years has been located in the west;</P>
      <P>and calls on the Government to urgently frontload capitalisation for infrastructure and employment opportunities, to speed up the introduction of broadband technology, to upgrade third level educational facilities and to promote the continuation of agricultural activity in the region.</P>
      <P>The changes in the world economy have given the west the opportunity to compete equally in the global economy but this chance is being taken away by Government inaction. Progress is being blatantly and unforgivably stalled by Government inaction through the Fíanna Fáil and Progressive Democrats policy of &ldquo;<i>mañana</i> infrastructure&rdquo;. What is worse is that a creeping policy of abdication of responsibility by the Government in the guise of allocating authority to independent consultants and bodies such as the ODTR has meant that little action has been or is being taken. The prospects for participation by the west in the new economy are being hampered by a confused and often negligent attitude on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only 10% of the 30 million people entering Ireland each year do so in the west, including the 2.2 million who enter via Shannon. Most of the remainder enter through the Dublin access <Col N="320" /> points. As a tourist destination the west's best chance is the short break holiday visitor market, yet access is such that it takes a day to get there from the United Kingdom and a day to get back. Such poor access is very detrimental for business, particularly tourism, for which the west is outstandingly able to provide in every way except the critical fact that the infrastructure has been so neglected that few are able to get to or from the west. I accept that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has secured a three hour stop-over for Jordanian tourists; does she believe her job is done now? Is that really it?</P>
    <P>Can we take it that the Government is responsible for the natural and reasonable outcome of its actions or inaction? If we accept this, which incidentally is a presumption of law, are we left with no alternative than to accept that the Government has no desire to improve infrastructure in the west and is pursuing a <i>laissez faire</i> policy in relation to roads and rail access to the west? There once was a man who said, &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;; it is now easier to get to hell than it is to Connacht.</P>
    <P>This is affecting businesses as much outside tourism. In a recent survey by the Market Research Bureau for the chambers of commerce over three quarters of businesses wanted direct flights from the west to UK or London destinations. If they cannot get there by air they will find it hard to get there by any other means, but still no action has been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>The western region accounted for just 16% of total national employment between 1998 and 2000, mainly in Galway city. The job gains in the west are in Galway city and County Clare, which accounted for 90% of all job gains in the west, with counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal actually suffering a net loss. The west's national share of IDA jobs is falling every year from 22% in 1995 to 18.7% in 2000. Imagine in a booming economy a net loss of jobs. Does the Government accept responsibility for this or does it blame the IDA for not creating jobs in the region?</P>
    <P>The west hardly has a sea crossing choice, yet a key access route such as the N5 to Westport is in such a state of disrepair that the negligence is becoming malicious. There are eight national primary routes to the west, only one of which has been given dual carriageway status through the national development plan. This contrasts with all the roads from Dublin leading to the east coast, north and south. This shows the lack of priority the Government has given to western development. All Government road initiatives centre on one incorrect premise: that all roads lead to Dublin. There is foolhardiness to this arrogant presumption. I propose in particular the N2 to Donegal, the N5 to Westport, the N4 to Sligo and in line with my proposal on cross-Border cooperation the N16 should be upgraded.</P>
    <P>Roads are not just about lorries and the commercial movement of goods. Quality of life, and cars, are also dependent on the road network. It <Col N="321" /> is important that we receive definite promises from the Government that this will take place within a given timeframe. To date, we have nothing. The Government has clearly given priority to eastern seaboard road development over the west. Time is running out for road initiatives. Will the Government give a date and a decision on investment in roads for the BMW region or will it opt for its current strategy of allocating responsibility to unaccountable groups sitting on expensive reports and abdicating responsibility? </P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that people from all over Ireland contribute to State coffers, or does he believe it is just those on the eastern seaboard? I am not asking for anything unusual, just that the Government recognises it is spending the taxes paid by the people of the Border, west and midlands. If he will deign to recognise that the west contributes to the national budget, why is he so reluctant to give the west what it has paid for? Do we have to produce a receipt? I am not asking for any favours. It is not charity, it is basic infrastructure for which we have already paid. Tax for infrastructure should be the deal but the west seems to be expected to pay and not receive. That is what is happening and the Government is responsible, not the consultants, not civil servants, not the people of the west.</P>
    <P>The ESB warned the Government that large areas of Ireland are experiencing severe electricity supply problems due to the overloading of our electricity transmission system. Faced with five consecutive years of annual growth in electricity demand of about 6%, the ESB is attempting to meet the demands of a relatively industrialised country using a transmission system designed for a primarily agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>The problem is not just about supply, it is also about reliability. In Carrick-on-Shannon last Friday there was no electricity supply for ten hours and much business was lost. The ESB could offer no explanation for the failure. The electricity transmission system can be compared to our rural water scheme. The problem is that the more people who are put on the system the slower the flow rate. In a water scheme this means that the pressure in a shower is less than desirable. In a transmission system it means that voltages drop, lights dim, computers cut out and data is lost. None of this causes a serious problem for the domestic user but many industries such as biotechnology and computer firms are dependent on electricity of a regular voltage. Foreign companies who are considering setting up in an area will want to know that the required supply of electricity will be available at the correct voltage and that if one transmission line is hit by lightning or taken out for maintenance, they will still have power. This is one of the main problems facing the ESB. At present three of the five lines that have to be cut off for maintenance are shut down at weekends or bank holidays. Substantial new infrastructure must be provided without delay to rectify this situation. The problem with the <Col N="322" /> development of the transmission system is not one of money. ESB is currently investing about £200 million in the system and has plans to invest a further £250 million. Because of planning delays, it can take eight years to build a single line. This is the responsibility of the Government. Will the Taoiseach and the Government accept responsibility for energy supply to the west?</P>
    <P>The ESB has a poor record of consultation with local communities. The choice between overhead and underground cabling is clear-cut, according to the Government and the ESB. However, the only costing offered by the Government has been produced by the ESB itself. About two months ago, I formally asked the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide another costing from an independent party. There was no response and no action was taken. The lives of many are overshadowed by the prospect of unnecessary and dangerous overhead pylons. Over 4,000 people have objected to the proposed construction of a transmission line through Flagford, County Roscommon, to serve Sligo town. The lack of response from the Minister on the costing is insulting to the people who will have to live with the decision.</P>
    <P>I believe that gas supply is a solution to part of our energy problem in the western region. The Government has not put a time frame in place for the delivery of gas to Sligo. They have merely announced that it will take place at some stage. A date should be set and a distribution plan should be implemented. This ideally should be done in conjunction with other infrastructural works. However there is no time frame for gas, roads or broadband Internet. I know from experience that if there is no time frame, there is no promise. If the Government was candid enough to admit that none of this is going to happen, then at least that would allow private investors to assess the possibilities. While the Government continues to pander, promise and procrastinate, no business will enter the area.</P>
    <P>According to measurements of educational participation, the two worst performing counties are Monaghan and Roscommon which score participation rates of 13.1% and 12.16%, respectively, in third level colleges. This contrasts dramatically with the three best performing counties &ndash; South Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which scored 21.11%, 24.52% and 37.8%, respectively. It comes as no surprise that the eastern seaboard has the highest educational involvement. This can be attributed to the low level of investment in education in the west, and particularly the north-west. Does the Government accept these figures? Silence is legally deemed to be assent and silence is all we have had from the Government in response to calls to level the educational playing field for the Border, midlands and western region.</P>
    <P>A university facility is urgently required in the Sligo region. The amalgamation and change of status of existing facilities is more than justifiable for three main reasons. First, depopulation can be <Col N="323" /> stalled and reversed by enabling students to stay in the west for third level education while bringing in further students from all over the country. Second, the presence of research and scientific facilities is a recognised prerequisite for biotechnology firms in considering development locations. Third, the employment and community advantages of a university have the effect of bonding and augmenting communities.</P>
    <P>High speed telecommunications capability is essential to compete for e-commerce business on the international stage. A well developed broadband infrastructure across the country is essential to avoid the over-concentration of national investment in the Dublin area. E-commerce negates entirely the historic disadvantage of the west of Ireland in attracting investment and quality employment for its people. When the west has an Internet infrastructure, it can compete globally with San Francisco, Singapore, Munich or Dublin. This is a golden opportunity for the west. The new economy removes trade barriers such as geographic location and is ideal for the west. Unfortunately, the Government's failure to allow for an Internet infrastructure is disproportionately affecting the west. Small scale individual exceptions have been facilitated to provide bandwidth for certain groupings in Dublin but nothing comparable has been done for the west. In fact, when the Government speaks of Internet infrastructure, it refers to City West in Dublin, not the west, the midlands or the Border region.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, said in her watershed comments of 1998: </P>
    <P>Of immediate significance is the proposed unbundling of the local loop. This would allow competitors of Telecom Éireann to gain access to individual customer lines at a price comparable to costs of establishing new lines. This will have the effect of accelerating the development of competitive service offerings, while minimising economic disruption and unnecessary duplication of local access networks.</P>
    <P>I agree, but three years have passed since the Minister made that statement and nothing has progressed in the meantime. Ireland Offline was established because of frustration with the Government's inaction and negligence in providing bandwidth and affordable Internet access for small to medium sized enterprises and customers. That body has said that what is available now is far from adequate and has called for urgent action by the Government to allow universal flat rate access to the Internet for all users, complete local loop unbundling by Eircom and universal access to broadband services for all users.</P>
    <P>Eircom has stated that it is unable or unwilling to provide e-commerce infrastructure to the west. I call on the Government to give a firm commitment that the financial resources provided to Eircom will be ring-fenced and that this money will only be expended to provide urgently needed <Col N="324" /> broadband infrastructure in the west. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a lack of capital investment in the western counties. The west is seriously discriminated against, as outlined in the motion before the House. We got less than 10% of all jobs created in the State over the past three years. In the Government's amendment, it claims credit for the retention of Objective One status for the Border, midlands and western region. That status was maintained as a result of the campaign by Deputies on this side of the House, especially those from the west, including Deputies Jim Higgins, Ulick Burke, John Perry, Gerry Reynolds and myself, for the retention of Objective One status, which is well justified. In the counties of the Border, midland and western region, GDP is less than 75% of the national average. In fact, it dropped from 75% in 1991 to 70% in 1995 in the western counties.</P>
      <P>The NESC report on population distribution and economic development, which was published in December 1997, showed the percentage change in employment by region from 1971 to 1996. There was a 5% increase for the Border region and 5.7% for the western region compared to 23% for the rest of the country. Population trends for the western counties show a depressing picture. Apart from the growth of Galway city, the population of the western counties has seriously declined. CSO figures show that from 1926 to 1996 there was a decrease in population in all parts of Connacht, with the exception of Galway city and surroundings. While the Galway borough population increased from 14,227 to 57,241, the population figures for the rest of County Galway, and for all the other Connacht counties, show a serious decline. County Galway might be regarded as the most prosperous county in the west, but its population has decreased from 169,366 in 1926 to 131,613 in 1996 &ndash; a 22% decline. I will mention the figures for just a few towns: Mountbellew had a 40% decrease, from 12,652 to 7,631; Oughterard and district had a 24% drop, from 14,494 to 10,960; the Clifden and Cleggan area, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy is familiar, went down from 2,399 to 1,980 &ndash; a 16% drop; Bunowen-Ballyconeely, an area which I know particularly well, showed a 47% drop from 800 to 425; County Leitrim went down from 55,907 to 25,057, a drop of 55% in that period; Mayo went down from 172,290 to 111,524, a 35% drop; Roscommon declined from 83,556 to 51,975, a 38% drop, while Sligo declined 22% from 71,388 to 55,821; Cavan went down 36%; Donegal 15% and Monaghan 21%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Connacht's steady progress has mainly been in the last eight years. In 1993, 900 jobs were lost when Digital transferred a section to Ayr, Scotland. It was a serious blow to Galway and shock waves went through the city. I was mayor then and a task force was set up which established an enterprise employment force. It fought back with <Col N="325" /> the talent, experience and expertise of the Galway people. The people of the west are resilient and Galway fought back to the position it enjoys today. The rest of Connacht suffered a minus in that period and over the last 70 years as the figures show.</P>
    <P>The discrimination against the west is shown in the distribution of the last round of Structural and Cohesion Funds, 1994 to 1999. Ireland benefited by £5.175 billion but the 13 counties of Connacht and the Border counties received £1.683 billion while the other 13 eastern and southern counties received £3.492 billion. Another example is that Counties Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow received £1.721 billion from those funds, more than the counties in the Border, midland and western region.</P>
    <P>Many essential projects in Galway city and county depend on Structural Funds. The city, capital of the west and the fastest growing in Ireland, needs major capital expenditure on roads and rail to alleviate the increasing traffic chaos in the city and approach roads. We must plan a commuter rail service to take workers and shoppers to Galway from Tuam, Athenry, Oranmore, Claregalway and surrounding areas. It should be part of the Government's plans but it is not. It allows the situation to worsen daily. To relieve the traffic congestion at the Headford Road roundabout, there should be a fly-over from the Sean Mulvey Road to the Quincentennial Bridge to separate the westbound traffic from that on the Headford Road and distributor roads into the city. These are essential projects the Government should look at. The Connemara environment project was submitted to Brussels in 1995 and its estimated cost then was £75 million. Connemara needs essential services. Clonbern, Leenane, Carraroe, Roundstone and Clifden require sewerage treatment plants. They are tourism areas and we breach EU regulations by pumping raw sewage into the sea. The Government should address these matters.</P>
    <P>The rail service should be improved with a second line from Athenry to Galway city linking Tuam and Oranmore. Galway is unique in having a station in the heart of the city, in Eyre Square. People should be brought in by train to alleviate the traffic problems. Much work must be done in the western region. I do not have enough time to go into further aspects of it. I call on the Minister of State here this evening, Deputy Molloy, who represents the area, to ensure that the Government becomes serious about plans to develop the west's infrastructure, especially the Connacht counties. We are being left behind as the statistics prove. Under the new Structural Funds, in which we have Objective One status, let the money be spent here. The priority must be to reverse what happened in the last five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for sharing his time and compliment him on this timely motion. It is regrettable that we have only Deputy Molloy here this evening. He is a western <Col N="326" /> Minister, but the Minister of State with responsibility for regional development, Deputy Ó Cuív, is absent. He has not yet realised his responsibilities. Shortly after being appointed, he admitted that he did not know his areas of responsibility. Deputy Davern, who had responsibility for western development for the past four years, failed to do anything positive. He lacked initiative and drive to advance any project in the Government's lifetime. It is too late for promises as we approach the next general election.</P>
      <P>We see a tug of war between the Ministers, Deputies Ó Cuív and Fahey, in Deputy Molloy's own constituency over a project vital to the development of the west, especially Galway city and county. Neither knows what to do about Galway Airport and development funds for it. Deputy Molloy sits on the fence leaving them to fight it out. That is the problem with western development under this Government. There is no doubt that its first vital mistake was to transfer western development from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is the death of any area to be placed under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development because nothing will happen. That Department's empire builders will ensure that.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Western Development Commission was established by statute. It had responsibility for spending £25 million that year. &ldquo;The Review and Outlook for Agriculture and Western Rural Development, 2000-2001&rdquo; published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development recently, states on page 65, that:</P>
      <P>The Commission is responsible for the operation of the £25 million western development investment fund in this area. The fund will contribute to the strategic development of the area through investment in business start-ups, growth orientated small and medium enterprises as well as in community based developments aimed at encouraging enterprise development in the area. [This is the important part.] To date 11 projects have been approved by the WDC for assistance totalling £1.54 million and £0.55 million has been drawn down from that fund to aid three projects.</P>
      <P>Three years, three projects, £0.55 million, and we call that western development. It is a scandal and those responsible for delivering that service and for this fund should resign immediately. It is incompetence beyond belief. We have £25 million to spend to assist, provide services and enterprise in the west but only £0.5 million has been spent in three years. It is a damning statistic from which the Minister of State cannot run. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development himself put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot expect this Government to be serious about western development. Deputies McCormack and Reynolds mentioned the decline in agriculture. In the country as a whole there will be 20,000 full-time farmers. What will be left in <Col N="327" /> the west when <i>pro rata</i> we break that down as to a viable existence in the west under present farming conditions? There will be far fewer full-time farmers. The flight from rural Ireland continues and nobody, certainly not this Government, has done anything. Nobody, certainly not this Government, has cried &ldquo;halt&rdquo; or has done anything positive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack mentioned Objective One status. It was a fight in this House that brought the Government screaming to the table to say it would fight for Objective One status for the western, midland and Border counties. It was reluctant to do that and that reluctance has since resulted in inaction and absolute failure in regard to policies for western development. As recently as 1 May, I endeavoured, through the Taoiseach's office, to ask various Ministers the amount of money each Department has spent over and above what was previously spent as a result of our Objective One status. Six Ministers declined to answer because they could not identify additional funds spent by their Departments in the BMW region. If that is Government, it is time to query what the Government is doing. It is time the Government allowed those with initiative and commitment to the west to do something about it and to stop the rot which is happening under this Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to job creation, on three previous occasions I have indicated the failure of the Government, particularly the Tánaiste, to identify one job in the past 25 years in Ballinasloe, east Galway, which has been IDA-assisted. There has been a net loss of jobs. Only last week 40 temporary employees of the Square D firm were let go because of difficulties. Last year A.T. Cross finally came to halt. That was the flag ship in terms of jobs and industry in Ballinasloe but all those jobs were lost. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, the Tánaiste and a few others, including the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, met and formed a task force but they have done nothing since to create a job in that important town, one of the largest in County Galway. Is that a record of which to be proud four years after entering Government? There has been a net loss in employment.</P>
    <P>We talk about infrastructural development throughout the country. The NRA said the farmers, landowners and property owners of the west are entitled to the same rate of compensation as those in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare or elsewhere in the south east or south. However, it has failed miserably to recognise that holdings in the west are smaller and that the damage done because of severance as a result of that necessitates a more generous response in terms of compensation, but it said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It cost the NRA £20 million extra to change the route of the N18 from Oranmore to Gort because of 42 bats in a barn on the route. To this Government and a Government agency bats are more important than people in the west. It is unfortunate that the relevant Minister is not <Col N="328" /> here to face his responsibilities. It is a pity he does not know what his responsibilities are because he too is failing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this important motion and I thank Deputy Reynolds for raising it. I would like to continue in the same vein as Deputy Ulick Burke. I am very disappointed that this Government has failed to deliver in regard to development, particularly given that the Taoiseach was in Ballaghadereen with the Cabinet to launch this big plan. I do not want to take from the commitment of the management committee in Dillon House. An ambitious plan and a blueprint for success was launched at that time &ndash; a massive document. The west is full of documents, but there has been little action. Although a blueprint for success, a big document, was launched in the media at that time, little or nothing has happened since.</P>
      <P>Policies for western development need to reflect the unique character of the region. Four fifths of people, or 657,000, live outside towns with a population of 5,000 or more. There are few, if any, plans for small towns in the west. We have all these bodies &ndash; the Western Commission, the enterprise boards and State agencies. The Government amendment to the motion refers to the progressive implementation of the national development plan 2002-06. I believe the Taoiseach said this plan would run until 2010. The plan will not be implemented in four years. There is no plan of action for the west.</P>
      <P>In Sligo, for example, the improved energy infrastructure is not there to bring in jobs. I spoke to an industrialist in Sligo the other day and he has 26,000 square feet and a massive office complex which is empty. There are no new jobs in Sligo. There are improved services at Sligo regional airport and at the international airport at Knock, but nothing is happening there. It is all lip-service.</P>
      <P>In regard to the seven counties of the west, it is definitely the case that it is all hype and no action. This Government is totally spent with consultant after consultant and launch after launch but no action. The Minister cannot say there have been any new jobs or a major industry in Sligo since I came into the House in 1997. We have not been licked by the Celtic tiger which has gone elsewhere. I am very disappointed that in the time it was here, Sligo did not benefit.</P>
      <P>We talk about the spatial plan which is another joke. There is no spatial plan. This Government has not announced the plan or the future growth centres. Sligo was identified by Fine Gael as a future growth centre, but that has not happened. We have chaos with the N4 into Sligo, that is, securing the development of the N4 to dual carriageway &ndash; motorway standard. Deputy Reynolds referred to other routes as well. The main concern is the N4 and that plan has not taken off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Small villages and towns were definitely sold a pup in regard to the Western Commission. Deputy Ulick Burke spoke about the very committed staff. It took years for the Government to give the funds &ndash; it was an EU problem and it had difficulty securing the funds. It is not that people want grants, but small companies need to survive in the small regions. The west is distinctly different to any other region and we need a document, a plan, that will encourage development in small villages and towns but that has not been developed.</P>
    <P>Tourism is on its knees at the moment and there is not a plan for tourism. We all hear of the major tourism destinations, but we need to develop new destinations. Where is the plan for that? The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has not come up with a new plan for the west even though he is from Donegal. I have not seen an ambitious plan for the north west. This Government has failed.</P>
    <P>People's income has not improved even though the economy is doing exceedingly well. There is a huge expectation, but this Government has failed to deliver in many areas. It has neglected small regions. We all hear the big announcements in regard to the bigger towns and cities on the east coast but when it comes to the designation of Sligo as a future growth centre, this Government has failed in regard to that commitment. It has not clearly stated that Sligo will be a future growth centre in the national development plan. The development plan for the west was supposed to be implemented from 2000 to 2006. This Government will not deliver it and with a change of Government, we will certainly prioritise serious disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We hear the hype in regard to the BMW region. Nothing has happened in the region. The Border, midland and western region has a plan. Despite the campaign to acquire Objective One status, there is little or no evidence of anything being done, particularly when one sees the evidence in Sligo where an industrialist has invested his own money in the provision of factory space which is lying vacant in Sligo town. That is an indictment of what the Government has done for the west. I am disappointed it has failed dismally to deliver on all the hype. When the election is called, the west will rally and give a message to the candidates seeking office to implement the mandate clearly established in the blueprint for success because the Government will not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The enormous economic strides that have been made over the past decade, the tremendous opportunities now available to our school and college graduates, and the return of so many of our people to live and work contrasts with the scourge of emigration this country endured over most of the past 150 years. While all regions of the country have benefited from this progress, the national development plan recognises that the regional distribution of our economic progress has been uneven. Rapid growth has taken place, particularly in the major urban areas but, by way of contrast, other parts of the country have been making more modest economic progress.</P>
      <P>For this reason, more balanced regional development is a fundamental objective of the Government's plan. Balanced regional development is about all parts of the country being able to participate in economic and social progress and being able to benefit appropriately from the opportunities it presents. Such a balance is essential if we are to fully exploit our resources and deliver on our long-term national objectives and great national potential. We must build on the economic progress we have achieved over the past decade, sustain it into the future and ensure its benefits are more widely spread. More balanced regional development will benefit the less developed regions through increased prosperity and the more developed regions through reduced congestion and pressure on infrastructure.</P>
      <P>This was among the most prominent considerations before the Government as it approached the preparation of the plan. It involves an investment of more than £40 billion in 1999 prices over the seven year period from 2000 to 2006. It is the largest investment plan ever drawn up by this State.</P>

      <P>It has four basic strategic objectives: continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth, consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness, fostering balanced regional development, which is particularly relevant in the context of the motion we are discussing and promoting social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the disparities in economic and social progress within the country, the Government successfully negotiated with the European Union for the designation of the country into two regions &ndash; the southern and eastern region and the Border, midlands and western region. This arrangement enabled Objective One <Col N="332" /> status to be retained for the BMW region for the full period to 2006 while the southern and eastern region qualifies for a transitional regime for Objective One status until 2005. To give this arrangement full effect, an assembly was established in each of the two regions. Our successful arrangements with the European Union regarding regionalisation forms one of the building blocks in the national development plan for the pursuit of more balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>There is broad consensus that our infrastructure has not kept pace with our economic growth and development and that improved infrastructure is now the key issue for a better qualiyy of life and for national development. There is an urgent need to develop our infrastructure to meet the country's growing needs, to maintain and improve our competitiveness, to enhance our quality of life and to provide greater protection for our environment.</P>
      <P>The impact of this investment will be very visible in the western counties. The national road network in the region will be dramatically improved over the period through the upgrading of the following routes: the N2 &ndash; Dublin to Border/Derry, N3 &ndash; Dublin to Cavan, N4 &ndash; Dublin to Sligo, N5 &ndash; Dublin to Westport and N6 &ndash; Dublin to Galway. Major improvement works on other national primary and secondary routes in the region will also take place.</P>
      <P>National primary route projects with a total estimated value of approximately £2 billion, including the N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 routes serving the western counties, are currently in planning. Most of these projects are scheduled to be completed or under way by 2006.</P>
      <P>The motion makes no reference to non-national roads. This is understandable because when it comes to non-national roads there has not been any lack of investment in the western counties referred to. Non-national road grants generally have increased significantly in recent years. Funding of £323 million has been allocated for non-national roads this year. This is a 20% increase on last year's expenditure of £269 million and an 85% increase on the 1997 expenditure of £174.8 million. That money was made available by the Government, which the Deputies opposite supported at the time, but they have now come in here with their fairytales.</P>

      <P>The BMW region, in which all these counties with the exception of Clare are situated, accounts for 40,514 or 44.9% of the 90,303 kilometres of non-national roads. The national development plan provides for investment of £848 million at current prices in this region in the 2000 to 2006 period.</P>

      <P>Overall, the investment in national and non-national roads in the BMW region will contribute towards providing easier access to employment, training and social opportunities for the region's inhabitants and offering existing firms and potential investors better access to the national road network and, thus, to domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>Under the NDP, almost £3 billion has been provided for water and waste water services, which is more than three times the outturn of £906 million under the previous NDP. Of the total expenditure, the BMW region will benefit from expenditure of almost £1 billion up to 2006.</P>
      <P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, the first of a series of rolling three year programmes providing details of major public schemes to be undertaken, contains schemes valued at almost £650 million for the seven counties referred to in the motion. Investment in the BMW region under the programme during 2000 amounted to just over £100 million. The next three year programme will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>The rural water programme is comprised of a range of capital grant measures to assist in the upgrading and development of rural water supply and waste water infrastructure, principally that of group water schemes. The main emphasis of the programme is on improving the quality of water under such schemes. Members will recall the mess these group water schemes were in under the management of the last Government. Of the total investment of £420 million under the programme, 70% will occur in the BMW region.</P>

      <P>The Government's investment in housing and related infrastructure is yielding positive results. Measures taken by the Government have led to the achievement of a record housing output of 49,812 units nationally in 2000 &ndash; the sixth successive year of record output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided, for the first time, a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of £6 billion in the national develop<Col N="334" /> ment plan. Funding under this heading and for housing related infrastructure was further increased by £984 million in Action on Housing, reflecting the commitment of the Government to tackle social and affordable housing need. This investment will ensure the housing needs of almost 100,000 families will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan. We have provided for an increase of 6,000 starts in the local authority housing programme with funding for 41,500 starts over the period of the plan, front loaded to meet existing demand more quickly.</P>
      <P>The annual resources allocated to housing since the Government took office have trebled to just over £1.1 billion in 2001 with the funding for local authority and social housing programmes increasing from £179 million in 1997 to almost £703 million this year.</P>
      <P>The western region has shared in this increased investment in social housing. The capital allocation to the counties concerned in 2001 under the local authority housing programme amounted to just over £80 million compared with £30 million which the previous Government made available in 1997. We have provided an increase of 166% in that short period.</P>

      <P>The Government's response to overall housing needs forms a coherent, connected and strategic response unlike that of the previous Administration. The action taken by the Government will result in further moderation of house prices, increased and more effective provision of social and affordable housing and a more integrated approach to the provision of accommodation for disadvantaged groups such as the homeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan also provides for the economic and social well-being of rural communities and the continuation of agricultural activity in the western region. It provides for total public expenditure of £4.8 billion in the agriculture, food and related rural development areas, of which approximately £2.9 billion will be expended in the BMW region.</P>
      <P>With almost £4 billion in national and EU funding, the CAP rural development plan will account for the bulk of this public expenditure with approximately £2.6 billion being expended in the BMW region. Its four measures concern early retirement, compensatory allowances, rural environment protection and forestry. It will facilitate structural change, support farmers on low incomes, promote sustainable development and provide opportunities for increased income through afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Measures included in the national development plan, including on-farm investment measures to encourage competitiveness and enhanced environmental and hygiene standards, improved installation aid for young farmers and a comprehensive support package for the food industry, have an allocation of £897 million of which £426 million is likely to be expended in the BMW region. In addition to the measures outlined, rural communities will benefit from other NDP initiatives. The plan provides £6.7 billion in total for actions that will directly impact on rural areas. Rural communities will also benefit from planned investment in other NDP areas such as those relating to roads, housing and health.</P>
    <P>On job creation, it is an objective of industrial policy to bring about an improved regional distribution of employment and the specific targets and objectives for the agencies are set out in the long-term strategy report of Forfás. Progress is being achieved by the agencies in increasing the proportion of job approvals in the BMW region. In fact, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new green field investment projects have been secured for the Objective One region, which is ahead of expectations in the three year target set out at the beginning of the year. The jobs will come on stream over the next few years. During 2000, in addition to jobs negotiated, IDA Ireland acquired eight land holdings throughout the BMW region, which will be developed as business parks to cater for the changing needs of inward investment clients. The parks will provide mainly office rather than manufacturing space. These developments underpin the strong regional focus in the IDA's activities and complement rather than compete with other major developments undertaken by the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 10% of all jobs located in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant growth in the number of companies locating in the west region. This rose from 54 in 1993 to 73 in 2000. Employment figures for the same period rose from 7,375 in 1993 to 12,709 in 2000, an increase of 68%. New jobs created in this period grew more than eightfold from 262 in 1993 to 2,191 last year. Other employment such as temporary, contract employment, also grew reflecting the changing environment for many of our companies. Overall performance of the BMW region has improved, with unemployment in the region now down to 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2000. The latest migration data also indicates an increase in in-flows to the BMW region for the first time in many years. There is strong evidence from the agencies that many of these are returning migrants, bringing with them skills and experience gained elsewhere to take up employment opportunities in the BMW regions. While productivity in the BMW region has not kept <Col N="336" /> pace with that in other regions, principally due to the comparative sectoral composition of these regions, it is important to note that significant progress has been made by the BMW region relative to other EU countries, with GVA per person in the BMW region having increased from 60% of EU average in 1991 to 80% in 1998.</P>
      <P>However, to support the efforts of the job-creation agencies to bring development to the BMW region, there is an important obligation on local communities and their leaders to support and facilitate the timely provision of infrastructure essential for future social and economic development.</P>

      <P>In doing so there is a need to recognise and accept that the provision of essential infrastructure frequently brings change in the physical environment but that such change can be managed in a practical and pragmatic way which respects good principles of environmental conservation.</P>
      <P>In the education sector, substantial increased funding has been provided for the National University of Ireland in Galway. In addition, the Government has continued to invest in the development of other third level facilities in the west region in recent years in terms of staffing, budgets and additional courses. Over the past two academic years, the staffing complement has risen substantially in the institutes of technology at Letterkenny, Sligo and Galway-Mayo and the Tourism College Killybegs. A substantial number of new courses have been sanctioned and the budgets allocated to these colleges have increased accordingly. It is planned to continue to develop the framework for the structured development of institutes in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands. In this regard, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the Tourism College in Killybegs, Institute of Technology Sligo and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology will continue to play a major role in higher education.   </P>
      <P>The National Spatial Strategy will form the central thrust of Government policy to achieve more balanced regional development. It will provide a framework within which sectoral policy in areas such as enterprise development, tourism, services and agriculture can be co-ordinated and implemented in future in a way that helps to achieve more balanced development. It will also provide a national and regional context for future decision-making on investment in infrastructure. The strategy will aim to ensure that people, no matter where they live or work, can share more equally in the benefits of the economic and social development of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made with the development of the spatial strategy. The detailed research undertaken as part of Stage II of the strategy preparation process is now being used to inform a series of spatial policy indication papers <Col N="337" /> focusing on spatial opportunities and choices for different areas and the policies and actions that might flow from these. These spatial policy indication papers will be published in the latter half of next month. Their publication will be followed by an intensive period of consultation with social partners, regional and local interests, local groups and the general public. Drafting of the strategy will then commence with a view to its adoption and publication by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will deal with investment in other sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Continuing growth in the economy has resulted in increasing pressure on our infrastructure. The success of our economy has led to an increasing work force, increased demand for transport and an increasing level of car ownership. It is readily acknowledged that under successive governments public transport has historically been starved of investment that would have been needed to cater for the level of demand we now face.</P>
      <P>Since coming into power in 1997, the Government has intensified the vital national task of revitalising the country's public transport system. We are now urgently addressing the deficiencies caused by many years of neglect. The strategy to achieve that revitalisation is set out in the national development plan published last year. Two of the three stated aims of the plan refer specifically to the regions, investment in the rail network, which serves all regions of the country, and increased investment in public transport in the regions generally.</P>
      <P>The motion comes at a time of massive investment in public transport throughout the country. This Government plans to spend £2.2 billion over the next seven years. We have not seen investment in public transport on this scale since the peak of railway development in the 19th century. A total of £500 million will be spent on revitalising the mainline rail network, sending the clearest possible signal that the railway network has a bright future. Some £350 million of this will be spent on completing the five year railway safety programme. Some 490 kilometres of track will be renewed right across the network. A total of £150 million will be spent on railway renewal, especially on new rolling stock and the refurbishment of stations. It is obvious that this Government has committed itself to providing a modern efficient public transport system throughout the country. The Government has always acknowledged that the country is coming from behind in terms of railway investment and there is a lead-in time which must be allowed for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the House might be interested in some of the statistics relating to the work on the five lines to the western region, including £35.5 million invested in the rail line to Sligo since 1997 and the further £2 million which is being invested in 2001. This line will have all continuous welded track by the end <Col N="338" /> of next year and journey times will be reduced by up to 30 minutes as a result. Some £21 million has been invested in the Galway line since 1997. As a result of this investment the Galway line now has continuous welded track along the whole route. Approximately £10 million has been invested in the Westport and Ballina route since 1997. A further £10 million will be invested this year. The line to Ballina will have continuous welded track along the entire route by end of 2002 and the Westport section will be completed by 2004. The journey time from Dublin will be reduced by up to 20 minutes when this work is completed.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has sought expressions of interest from manufacturers for the supply of new mainline rail carriages. This is the first phase of a procurement process designed to improve the quality of service provided to mainline rail passengers.</P>
    <P>In addition, to the investment in rail services progress has also been made in improving bus services. Twenty three new low floor wheelchair accessible buses were purchased for Galway city services as part of the investment programme in bus services in provincial city bus services under the national development plan. These facilitated an improvement in the quality and frequency of bus services.</P>
    <P>In relation to air travel, I would like to assure the House that the Government is committed to the continued development of air transport to and from these regions to ensure that rapid access is available to everyone. Four of the country's six regional airports, namely, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal regional airports are located in the BMW region and, of course, the west is also served by Shannon Airport, which is owned and operated by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The support of the regional airports continues to be an express element of the Programme for Government and the commitment of this Government has been demonstrated through a number of support schemes that are designed to help develop and sustain the regional airport network.</P>
    <P>The Government has been supporting all six regional airports, including the four airports in the BMW region, through grant schemes down through the years to assist in the promotion and development of the airports. A total sum in the region of £250,000 was made available to these four airports in each of the four years 1996-99, inclusive. Last year, 60% of the marketing support budget, i.e., £895,000, was allocated to the four regional airports in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise is also responsible for the implementation of the regional airports measure of the national development plan. Over the period of the plan, £8 million has been allocated for the BMW region airports &ndash; Donegal, Galway, Knock and Sligo. The Department launched a general call for proposals to all the regional airports prior to Easter <Col N="339" /> and the closing date for receipt of these submissions is this Thursday, 31 May.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the Department allocated a fund of £5 million to provide for infrastructural improvements at the regional airports. Of this £5 million allocation, over £4.6 million was allocated to the four regional airports in the BMW region, again illustrating this Government's commitment to the development of infrastructure in the western region. The airports used the resources provided by this fund for various projects including runway upgrading and extension, improved lighting and ancillary capital works.</P>
    <P>The Department also administers the public service obligation &ndash; PSO &ndash; programme for the operation of essential air services on &ldquo;thin&rdquo; regional air routes to improve accessibility and encourage the growth of both industry and tourism related activities. The PSOs make an important contribution to the domestic air access network and facilitate business and tourism development in the regions.</P>
    <P>Under new contracts earlier this year, the PSO programme was expanded significantly with the creation of two new PSO routes between Knock and Dublin and between Derry and Dublin. Derry airport serves the area of East Donegal as well as Derry itself and its hinterland. The Knock PSO service provides a daily early morning flight to Dublin and a return flight every evening. There are two flights per day on the Derry/Dublin PSO route including an early morning departure from Derry and a late return flight. The Donegal and Sligo PSO routes were also renewed for a further three year period. In addition, the flight frequency on the Galway PSO route was increased from three to four daily return flights.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of supporting the PSO programme has been increased significantly to over £10 million per annum under the new contracts compared to an average annual subvention of approximately £3.3 million under the previous contracts.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is responsible for the management and operation of Shannon Airport. The company is committed to the continued development of the airport and to ensure the continued growth of traffic at the facility. The new terminal facilities at Shannon Airport were formally opened by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise in March last year. This new terminal, which is fully equipped with state of the art communications systems, has almost doubled terminal capacity to 4.5 million per annum, from 2.4 million previously. As a result, the airport is fully equipped to meet the demands of airport customers particularly in areas such as aircraft safety, passenger comfort and convenience and to exploit new traffic opportunities to the benefit of the mid-west region. Additional investment is proposed for the area, which will underpin the economic well being of the airport and the wider region as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> On natural gas, it is fair to say that the natural gas system in Ireland is about to undergo a complete transformation with the system being extended across the midlands and into the west. This is a very important development for the region as it will create a modern energy infrastructure and provide the basis for future development.</P>
    <P>BGE is proceeding with the ring main pipeline, which will run from Dublin through Athlone to Galway, and then south to Limerick, where it will connect with the existing natural gas network. This pipeline is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2002. In addition to providing additional capacity to flow gas around the country, the availability of natural gas will be extended to new areas of supply. The following towns have already been identified for connection as a result of this project &ndash; Trim, Shannon, Mullingar, Loughrea, Athlone, Galway, Ballinasloe, Gort, Athenry, Ennis, and Killaloe.</P>
    <P>BGE is also proceeding with the construction of a pipeline from the Corrib gas landing point to Craughwell, outside Galway, to join the ring main. This pipeline is scheduled for completion about April 2003. The development of this pipeline will enable gas to be connected initially to Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry. The ring main and Corrib spur pipelines will involve an investment of about £200 million in the BMW region. This is a large scale investment which will establish a core energy infrastructure in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government recently decided that the gas network would be extended to the north-west. There is a range of options for these extensions and BGE has engaged economic consultants to assist them in assessing the situation. On a preliminary basis, it appears that a pipeline extending the system to Sligo and Letterkenny would not be a commercial proposition as the demand for gas in these areas would not be sufficient to justify the capital investment. Funding an extension of the network raises competition and State aid questions and these issues along with the funding options are currently being examined. In any event, while these matters must be addressed and fully resolved, I will be reporting to the Government on the options and implications when the BGE report comes to hand in order to get the project under way.</P>
    <P>The need to upgrade the country's electricity infrastructure, particularly in the provinces, is noted and accepted. ESB and Eirgrid are embarking on a £2.1 billion programme of investment over the next five years designed to redress this matter. This investment will cover further work on the network renewal programme and the distribution system, low voltage, and also facilitate significant reinforcement of the transmission system, high voltage. Some of the main transmission infrastructural projects scheduled to be completed over the next five years are the Donegal loop, i.e., a 110 kV line from Binbane, near Killybegs, to a new 110 kV station in Gweedore <Col N="341" /> and continuing from there to Letterkenny; the Cloon, Tuam, to Castlebar 110 kV line; the Flagford to east Sligo 220 kV line and station; the Oldstreet, east Galway, 400 kV station and the 220 kV line to Cashla, Claregalway. By 2005, the effect of this investment will be represented by significant reinforcement of the electricity infrastructure in the western region.</P>
    <P>On telecommunications, the widest possible availability of competitive services has been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy since liberalisation. In recent years the Department has put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, £20 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. The majority of these projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the western counties.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to £158 million. There is a commitment that two-thirds of this budget will be spent in the BMW region. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received the Department entered nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of £126 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately £43 million.</P>
    <P>A feasibility study is being carried out into the installation of an Atlantic corridor providing broadband fibre optic cable along the western seaboard between Kerry and Donegal. The feasibility study will be completed this September. In late 2000, the Government launched the CAIT, Community Access to Information Technology, initiative. Under this initiative funding of £2.5 million is being made available to support projects aimed at introducing groups marginalised from information technology to its benefits. A large number of proposals have been received by the Department and are being evaluated. It is anticipated that there will be substantial support to these types of projects in western counties.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I reiterate this Government's demonstrated commitment to upgrading this country's infrastructure, including in the western counties.</P>
    <P>In late October 2000, the Government launched the community access to information technology initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been interesting that the speeches we have heard so far have not included a single reference to population. Similarly, there have not been any references to needed infrastructure or to the shift in population from rural areas, villages and towns to cities. This tells us, interestingly, that whenever planning issues are discussed, the Government's attitude is to produce endless lists of projected expenditure as a substitute for thought or a real attempt to come to grips with the issues. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is a nice man who has given many such lists. Deputy Molloy, who preceded him, could be called the Minister for lists as he was even more voluminous in his use of them. Now that the timetable for Knock airport has been put on the Dáil record, we may perhaps return to what I understand this motion to concern.</P>
      <P>Population statistics for many western counties were given by a Fine Gael speaker. I congratulate his party for putting down this motion. The statistics showed that the population of most western counties, such as Leitrim and Roscommon, has declined. It is very interesting, but I want to be positive. How can the Government credibly suggest that it has the slightest interest in planning, given that it has announced an expenditure programme over six or seven years of £40 billion without an effort at suggesting a time scale across sectors, communities and regions? The Government has not ever believed in regionalism or in regional planning, as reflected in its deep antipathy to the last Government's proposal to have regional structures in education. The Opposition of the time wrecked the proposal by opposing it tooth and nail, thereby revealing a deep commitment to centralisation. It is wrong that Ministers, the political representatives of those in the west, stand like puppets to read the Department of Finance's projected expenditure across sectors. The Department of Finance once opposed rural electricity as it thought it would never catch on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an interesting phrase in the last speech, when the reason for not extending the gas <Col N="343" /> pipeline was given. The speaker said that State aid and market competition issues need to be addressed. I will discuss whether they will be overcome by sticking with the point I was making. The Government ran into difficulty in relation to telecommunications infrastructure as it has not addressed the issues. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, did not mention the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 April about the comments of Deputy Jim Higgins. The Deputy was displeased by Eircom's decision to drop its proposal to bid for the installation of a telecommunications network, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> the previous month.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of State-led State aids and market competition, but the reality is that it is not possible for a company to provide universal telecommunications access without State intervention. In the case of the ESB, I refer to appropriate access to energy infrastructure. As market-led thinking has defeated State initiative, there is an enormous lag and the possibility that such initiative will not again be found in the west. Let us contrast such a prospect with any one of the principles of regional policy. I wrote about regional policy in 1974-75, when I was a founding member of the Irish Regional Studies Association along with people like Michael Bannon. At that time, literature suggested that regional policy should be implemented for any of three reasons.</P>
    <P>The first of these was a strong citizenship model which suggested that every citizen has the right to communicate, to enjoy a level of public services in the State and to participate in a community that has an infrastructure to enable it to develop. It was a rights based view. The second possible reason for implementing regional policy is because national economic growth is taking place and one should be entitled to participate in it. The third reason was available to those who did not accept the first two and argued that if a concentration of industry and services was allowed, a problem would be created which had two related sides. While urban dis-economies were created by pouring population on to an infrastructure that would have to be continually added to, an infrastructure with the capacity to deal with education, housing and similar matters was being abandoned.</P>
    <P>Urban dis-economies and rural decay are the two sides of the same coin. Where is the evidence of any aspect of regional policy in what we have heard? It is wonderful for a Government to have such resources available to it, but it is a pity that in these best of times we have such a bad Government, one that is hostile to planning. An elementary scholar approaching this area would ask how expenditure of £40 billion within a specific period can be announced, but the spatial plan will not be announced for another year or two. The spatial plan will deal with the distribution of people among towns, villages and cities. New growth cities will have to be identified and different cities and towns will have to be connected. It is an <Col N="344" /> appalling case of putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>I do not have enough time to go into this country's historic antipathy to planning, but it goes back to the 1930's and notions that the State should do nothing, should be dictated to by the market and should only help the poorest of the poor. An incredible attempt at centralising decision making has been made. Other speakers have correctly pointed out that, having used the BMW region to make the best possible contrived case to the EU, the Government has not proportionately distributed the results of what was received from Structural Funds to those places for which the Government made the greatest effort. To listen to long lists of proposed expenditure, from national Exchequer resources or from EU funding, is windy stuff and the aural version of watching a three card trick.</P>
    <P>People are interested in simple things. At the end of the plan, will all citizens enjoy the same access to communication? Will there be an information divide between the existing developed regions and those regions whose GDP is about 70% of that of more developed regions? The question must be answered with a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Will people have equal access to energy sources, such as electricity lines that can carry the same volume of energy as lines in the industrialised region? What is the answer, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;? The Government's answer is that State aids and market competition have to be balanced. It cannot fulfil the requirements of the motion moved by Deputy Gerry Reynolds unless it commits itself, as a State policy, to a concept of regionalism based on any one of the three things I have mentioned. We could debate the reason for having a regional policy, its shape or its content, but we are not getting to that point.</P>
    <P>One must look at the issues that arise as a result of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's speech. He gave a hidden jab at the end of the speech suggesting those who are interested in ecological and responsible development may be holding things up. He mentioned that communities will have to realise that development can take place with ecological attention. He said:</P>
    <P>To support the efforts of the job-creation agencies to bring development to the BMW region, there is an important obligation on local communities and their leaders to support and facilitate the timely provision of infrastructure essential for future social and economic development.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that it is the local communities that are blocking things? It continues:</P>
    <P>In doing so there is a need to recognise and accept that the provision of essential infrastructure frequently brings change in the physical environment but that such change can be managed in a practical and pragmatic way which respects good principles of environmental conservation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> That word &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; is a great word. It means that if we have made mistakes in the past we can cover them up in the present and continue them in the future. This is from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing. He has given us a lecture about how the community should behave in accepting what is decided for it. That raises a further question. What happens if the share which has been allocated to the National Roads Authority is taken out of the national development plan? In what country in the known world are plans for road infrastructure ahead of the national spatial plan? How will the national spatial plan appear when the expenditure decisions and decisions about roads have been taken? Is this not extraordinary? Maybe it will be a series of aerial photographs of what is being done in a piecemeal way. It is a disgrace, a scandal, that the national spatial plan is not put out in advance of these other important decisions. In so far as the Minister of State referred to his own successes in housing and other matters, and sticking to the question of roads, there is need to get over our antipathy to planning, about which I have said enough for the moment. I could say a great deal more.</P>
    <P>There is also need to construct a culture of consultation with the public. People do not need little paragraphs. What the Minister of State is talking about, and what the NRA has frequently talked about, is showing people what has been decided for them. That is defined at consultation. However, in most political democracies consultation is the definition of the problem, consultation on how it is to be approached, definition of different means of approaching it, the establishment of a plan in which people will be involved, the allocation of funds for it, its execution and monitoring. That is called democracy. The present Government &ndash; unfortunately Fianna Fáil has a long tradition of this, the Progressive Democrats more so because the market speaks to them in some ghostly way &ndash; will not accept that as a version of consultation. They produce two or three options, print them &ndash; all the technical resources are behind them at this stage &ndash; slap them up on a wall for a period of 28 days and say that is what has been decided. That is seen as consultation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the questions people are really asking. In agricultural regions they want to know whether there is a future for the farm family. Where the farms in the counties referred to in this motion differ from other farms all over the country is in relation to physical characteristics. As many as 70% or more are under 50 acres, and 50% could be under 35 or 40 acres. They differ in relation to soils and drainage. Economically, they differ in terms of what they can produce. They also differ as to the social characteristics of those who run them. I do not need a lecture on western development, or to be told that, having destroyed the opportunity for agricultural training for the sons and daughters of people from a farm in the west, the Government is deeply com<Col N="346" /> mitted to agriculture. We watched the loading towards 10% of farmers of the benefits of our entry into Europe. At the time of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, we could have worked the guidance element far better. It was all on guarantee. All the benefits, therefore, were primarily related to ability to increase output.</P>
    <P>Small farms which are not included in the Government's agricultural planning are also places where there are many rural houses which are falling into decay. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, when he was in full flight, mentioned that the amount of provision for social housing had increased by 166%. However, he forgot to say that due to his efforts the cost of housing had increased by 300%. He told us about moderating house prices. How is house price moderation being assisted by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy in eliminating the special tax that was supposed to be implemented on speculators? They suddenly found that tax reduced just the same as everything else, and the reason is that house prices are supposedly moderating. When I was on Galway Corporation with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, we used to wonder whether the housing list would ever reach 1,000 &ndash; it was usually around 800. Today it is 1,700, and people wait five years for the offer of a house of any kind. The Minister of State tells us house prices are moderating and that the spend on social housing has increased by 166%, but he does not tell us that his friends, the speculators, are getting between 300% and 400%. Why did he not tell us that? Why did he bow his knee to the speculative tendency, the people who are tearing the heart out of the economy?</P>
    <P>There are other questions people ask. A rural family asks if there is a future for the farm family. People in a village ask whether they will have basic services that will enable them to live there with dignity. People in towns ask what kind of electricity supply and telecommunications service they will have. People are also interested in housing. Many of them would be very willing to go and live in rural houses. Let us do something imaginative and draw up a list of all the need, beginning with planning. Let us find out how many abandoned houses are there in Ireland. The Government could give grants to have them refurbished and offered to people who desperately want rural housing.</P>
    <P>On transport, I am one of the people &ndash; Deputy McCormack is another &ndash; who use the train to Galway, in relation to which £21 million has been expended on the provision of a continuous welded line. I use that train every week. We hear explanations that people find humorous at times as to why the train is delayed. The suggestions include difficulty with the signalling. Perhaps the market theorists will tell us why it is that if two lines have to be put down alongside the railway line for signalling and telecommunications the telecommunications line for the private <Col N="347" /> telecommunications service goes down first and cannot then be interfered with to provide a proper signalling system? Is that not a clear case of the predator getting in first and the travelling public losing? Is there anything interesting in the rail network in the western region? Is there anything to suggest belief in an integrated infrastructure combining train, bus and other forms of transport? What we are really being told is that a great juggernaut of road design, funded out of the national plan that has nothing to do with the spatial plan, is coming down the road. If people want to entertain themselves in a couple of years time, several working papers will be available to show the spatial plan when it has been decided. People are looking for some very interesting and basic things. They want the population decline to surface in some speech. I am not inventing it. It is there in the census for anyone to see. They want to know about transport. They want to know about the evening up of infrastructure. They want a time scale on the expenditure. They want to be consulted on how it will happen. They also want to know what the Government's attitude is to expenditure from Europe and the precise initiatives that are being taken. What they have been offered is fascinating and really interesting. They have been told that the Minister of State to whom it was allocated as a responsibility finds it a waste of his time, which is rather like his cousin who has not been at a European Culture Ministers meeting, except for one, for the last several years, but nominates cities to be cities of culture. When he eventually finds out where his office is and migrates to it, he tells us that he wants to be a doer, to get his coat off and do things. If he is listening, why is he not listening to what is being said about the need for houses? When will these transport investments take place? What is the truth about the scandal of the signalling system on the western line?</P>

      <P>It is most disappointing that the Tánaiste is not present to reply to this debate. It is the usual situation with the Tánaiste &ndash; she will always be seen where there is good news but never where there is bad news. I have yet to see her in the House when there is trouble or when people lose their jobs and livelihoods. However, <Col N="348" /> she will be seen on television when jobs or something good is due to be announced. It is a case of &ldquo;Mary good news&rdquo;, never &ldquo;Mary bad news&rdquo;. It is the same this evening for this debate on the situation in Athy. It is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Power, was anxious to raise this matter but, unfortunately, due to a long standing prior commitment he is unable to be present tonight to do so. We were due to share time on the issue.</P>
      <P>On a recent visit to Athy, the Tánaiste said Athy was a strong candidate for decentralisation. That news was well received and I am sure she, like everybody else, was unaware of the devastating news that was to be announced last Friday. The closure of Peerless Rug factory, with the immediate loss of 65 jobs, is a severe blow to the economy of Athy. No doubt other jobs in the town are now vulnerable as a result of the knock on effect of this closure. Athy has suffered many blows in recent years in its industrial development. Numerous factories have closed, including Pyma, Sherwood Medical, Woodform and Hickeys. Previously, there were the closures of Wallboard and IVI. Job losses have also occurred in other factories.</P>
      <P>The continuous haemorrhage of employment must stop. I repeat my call to the Tánaiste, despite her absence from the House, to establish a task force for the region, as has been successfully done in other employment blackspots such as Tallaght and Clonmel. It is imperative that the positive work currently being done by Athy UDC, the chamber of commerce and the county council is supported by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It must provide the expertise and support required to overcome this latest employment setback to hit Athy.</P>
      <P>Athy is a pivotal town for the development of the south Kildare area. The Government must provide the necessary expertise, funding and political will for the future development of the area. So far, that commitment has been lacking from the Government. A commitment to decentralise a major Government agency or Department should form a key part of the strategy to renew employment in the town. This must go hand in hand with an all out effort to attract new investment to the area, given that there is now an advance factory and three other premises that are fully equipped for the needs of the modern economy lying idle there.</P>
      <P>Athy is making great strides on all other fronts. There are proposals at present for a shopping mall and a number of other commercial and residential developments in the town. A new technical college and a new PE hall for the two secondary schools are in the pipeline. A proposal for a new swimming pool and work on 1,300 new housing units have either commenced or are at planning stage. All of this is good news which is, alas, deflated by the latest factory closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to give a commitment to the people of Athy and south Kildare by agreeing to the provision of an employment task force and a <Col N="349" /> commitment to decentralise a Government agency to the town. In addition, it is imperative that the best quality training is now provided for the workers who lost their jobs in the Peerless Rug factory so they and their families can look forward to an early return to the workforce. These families have supported this industry since it started in the town in 1973. Many of the workers are now in their forties or early fifties and will find it difficult to get employment unless a proper structure is put in place to give them the necessary training to secure alternative employment.</P>
    <P>It is imperative the Government does this as a matter of urgency. The Government must instruct FÁS and other relevant State agencies to come to Athy and put a structure in place to meet the demands of these families. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, must convey to the Tánaiste the disappointment of the people of Athy about this closure and the fact that she has made no response to it in the last few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The House will be aware that the Tánaiste is in Waterford to announce 500 new jobs for the Waterford area. She sincerely regrets she cannot be here for the debate and, on the basis of collective responsibility within the Department, I am honoured to be present on her behalf.</P>
      <P>The closure of Peerless Rug will be a great disappointment to the people in Athy and the surrounding area. I appreciate the concerns which the redundant employees and their families are experiencing. Although the closure was only announced last Friday, discussions have already taken place with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. They have been asked to ensure that every effort is made to find alternative employment for the workers who are to lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>FÁS has already been in contact with Peerless Rug in Athy to offer its services to the employees. I am aware that the services available from FÁS have already been discussed with the managing director of the company. Arrangements were made to meet with the factory supervisor earlier today to discuss in detail the best way for FÁS to provide this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great regard for the town of Athy and, as the Deputy will be aware, I have some good friends there. I also have great respect for the Deputy. Unfortunately, Athy has suffered from a decline in traditional industrial sectors within the town. The Athy investment, development and employment forum was established to address the issues of above average unemployment, the deficit in the necessary infrastructure and the lack of substantial new investment in the area. This initiative is jointly funded by Kildare County Council, Athy UDC, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The Athy development forum is a good <Col N="350" /> example of partnership between the local business community, local and county authorities and the relevant State agencies all working together to ensure a prosperous future for the area.</P>
    <P>Over 50,000 people live and work within a 20 mile radius of Athy. The town has a population of over 6,000 people and this is expected to double during the next five years. Many of the people, especially those who have moved to Athy in recent years, work in the north of the county and in Dublin. The next step in the process of encouraging new industry into Athy is to undertake a skills survey which will provide vital information on the skills and experiences of residents who would prefer to work locally and would be a major asset in encouraging new businesses into Athy. FÁS proposes to undertake this survey over the next few months.</P>
    <P>In addition, Athy has been identified as a high priority both for investment and development by the relevant State agencies. In particular, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging the provision of a community enterprise centre in the town, incorporating training facilities, a crèche and small units for micro companies. Athy must, therefore, prove to prospective investors and businesses that it has what it takes in terms of infrastructure, workforce, facilities and the right attitude to show that it is a place in which to invest. Athy is well placed to be a strategic development growth centre in terms of jobs. It also has the quality environment sought by people who wish to live and work there. Athy is undergoing a transformation with major investment planned over the coming years in industrial and commercial sectors, along with housing, roads and leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the plans supported by Athy Urban District Council and local business interests in addition to the efforts by the State agencies under our remit, including Kildare County Enterprise Board, will see Athy develop into a town offering excellent opportunities for working, living and leisure in the years ahead. I will bring the Deputy's comments to the personal attention of the Tánaiste tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this problem on the Adjournment. Lismullen national school is located two miles outside Navan. The old part of the school was built in the 1930s; the school I attended is a similar type school and it was built in 1937. A small two room extension was added in recent years. There are 165 pupils at present and the inadequacy of the facilities has been known to the Department since 1986. There has been little response apart from letters and there has been no positive reaction to the needs of the pupils, teachers and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no purpose built PE room and the entire PE programme is taken outdoors, so it is obviously impossible to implement a huge por<Col N="351" /> tion of the programme without indoor accommodation. Each year when the school wants to stage performances for parents, which is part of the extracurricular activities teachers do, they must go to institutions outside the immediate area for a venue.</P>
    <P>There is also insufficient room in the school for proper parent-teacher meetings. The staff room is a converted cloakroom which is barely adequate in size and almost every day when visitors such as parents come to the school, discussions must take place in the corridors. There are no storage facilities and consequently one of the school corridors is totally congested, blocking a fire exit. That is a fact. There is nowhere to put equipment, as I saw when I was in the school last week.</P>
    <P>That is unacceptable in this day and age. There are two prefabricated buildings with low ceilings which are inadequate for the number of pupils in the school. The school requires a computer room, as it is essential today that a school has IT facilities available to it. There is one computer in every classroom as there is no space in the rooms for any more.</P>
    <P>The principal and parents' council of the school want funding for a new hall as well as an office, library, computer room, adequate storage space, staff car parking and room for parents to pull in when collecting children as parking on the road is very dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is no Minister for Education and Science present and it is disappointing to say the least that neither is available. Is it possible that a meeting could be set up so that a deputation from the school can be received in order that this matter can be brought forward? I thought having to wait five to eight years for such facilities was gone given the amount of money around. This kind of situation should not continue. I spent my early years in this House making representations to have schools built across my constituency but here we are in 2001 with a primary school looking for a small amount of money to provide badly needed facilities for 165 pupils. It is now six years later and nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The main reason being given to these people is that the Department is waiting to see what other schools will have to be built in the locality given the expansion of Navan. That should not be a reason to delay the provision of funds for badly needed facilities for the students of this school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It affords me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, who is engaged in other business, of outlining to the House the current position regarding the application received in the Department's planning and building unit for additional permanent accommodation, at Lismullen primary school, Navan, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school is located approximately five miles <Col N="352" /> south-east of Navan town centre and a short distance off the main Navan-Dublin road. It is also close to the rapidly developing eastern end of Johnstown parish and is the only primary school there at present. This area has been developing extensively over the last number of years and is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The impact of these developments on existing school provision in the general Navan area is being monitored by the planning section of our Department in an effort to determine the overall long-term educational requirements of the area. Close contact is being maintained with Meath County Council and the Navan development plan indicates that up to 3,000 houses will eventually be built in the vicinity of Lismullen primary school.</P>
    <P>The school experienced a decline in enrolments in the recent past, dropping from 205 pupils in the early 1990s to 159 in 1999-2000. As a direct result, the staffing at the school also decreased during that period, levelling out at a principal and five mainstream class teachers in September 1998. However, it would appear that a turnabout has occurred in the school's enrolment pattern. The figure for September 2000, the current legal figure agreed for staffing, is 163 and showed a slight increase on the previous year. This is seen as an indication of the initial impact of local housing developments on the school. The current staffing of a principal, five mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher is likely to be maintained for the school year ahead. The planning and building unit of our Department is at present examining this school's application taking all relevant factors, such as the aforementioned housing developments and demographic trends, into full consideration.</P>

        <b>:</b> While the decision to sell the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited, Whitegate Oil Refinery and Whiddy Island Terminal for US$100 million is being dressed up in positive terms &ndash; that is, the $100 million and a drop of 0.4 pence per litre of petrol &ndash; I am less than enthusiastic about the sale.</P>
      <P>The Tosco/Phillips acquisition will place a significant national asset in the hands of a large non-EU company unfettered by Irish strategic concerns. The State will be beholden to a large multinational energy company for its refining and storage facilities. I am particularly concerned about the issue of the 90 day oil reserve. The existing arrangement with the INPC is that the State has a 90 day oil reserve guarantee but this is not included in the deal approved by Government yesterday. Why was it not included? This is an issue of vital national concern. Why did the State not insist that the 90 day oil reserve, so essential as a safeguard for our national interests in the event of an emergency, be included?</P>
      <P>The purchase price of the refinery and terminal is US$100 million. Last week in a reply to a written parliamentary question from Deputy Stanton, the Minister for Public Enterprise stated:</P>
      <P>. . . the purchaser has sought a ministerial guarantee which would have the effect of the State being liable for any of the INPC's liabilities under the legal agreement should the INPC be unable to discharge them . . .</P>
      <P>We know that the cost of the refurbishing work carried out by the INPC is £60 million which gave rise to the annual levy of £14.5 million on consumers. The Minister has now guaranteed that whatever outstanding liability there is for refurbishing and other liabilities is to be paid off by the Government as part of the deal. What I want spelt out clearly is what are these liabilities? What do they come to in financial terms? How much of the purchase price of US$100 million will be eroded by the discharge of these liabilities by the taxpayer?</P>
      <P>Again, when referring to this underwriting guarantee last week the Minister went on to state:</P>
      <P>This guarantee could cover certain potential environmental liabilities. The details of the latter have been the subject of substantial negotiations between the parties and I am satisfied that it would be against our commercial interest to disclose them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I genuinely do not wish to be negative in relation to the Tosco Corporation and I wish them every success. However, the Minister knows full well that concerns have been expressed about Tosco's <Col N="354" /> environmental record in the United States leading to a considerable number of clashes between the State, the company and environmental groups. How can it be &ldquo;against our commercial interest&rdquo; to disclose what level of guarantee has been given to pay for environmental accidents or negligence on the part of a private company? Are we not giving Tosco a blank cheque? Even if Tosco never had a difficult environmental track record, why should the State pick up the tab for any environmental incidents for which the company itself should be solely responsible? As regards the 235 workers, how copper-fastened is the 15 year guarantee of employment? When will the employee share option trust come into being and what are the details of same?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, Ireland depends on foreign imports of oil by sea more than other nations. At present there is a tightening in the availability of refined petroleum product locally, in Europe and globally. We must be sure that we are doing the right thing in selling this State asset to Tosco.</P>
      <P>I understand that Tosco itself is in the middle of being taken over by Phillips and is going through a period of uncertainty. Perhaps we should hasten slowly and wait until the dust settles on that take-over before we allow this sale to go through. I want a proper debate on this issue. There are jobs at stake. It is important for the economy, for the consumer, for the workers and for the environment that we get this right.</P>
      <P>The refinery at Whitegate has a proud record. It is making a substantial profit at present. People have said that we are giving away this facility to Tosco. I want to know how sure the Minister is of the 15 year guarantee. Is it worth the paper on which it is written?</P>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach told us three times that legislation will be produced in the autumn but today he said legislation would be produced before the end of this session. It strikes me that this is being rushed and I caution the Government to hasten slowly and get it right. There is no hurry. Whitegate is going extremely well and it is making a great deal of money at present.</P>
      <P>As my colleague said, we also must be careful about the strategic reserves. Last winter certain parts of the country were very close to running short of petrol and home heating oil. We cannot take a risk with this. We must be careful. We must be sure. There is too much at stake. I look forward to the Minister's reply but I am also demanding a full debate in committee and in this House. I do not want this legislation guillotined. I want everything on the table. When it happens we need to know what we are voting on.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> On Saturday, 26 May, a milestone was reached in the proposed transaction involving the disposal of the business and certain assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to the Tosco Corporation, a major US refiner and marketer of oil products. On that occasion, legal documents were signed by the two companies which set the sale process on course for completion on 16 July next, subject to certain significant conditions being met in the interim.</P>
    <P>The main assets involved in the proposed sale are the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy Island oil terminal in Bantry Bay, which are operated by subsidiary companies of the INPC. A third subsidiary company, the National Oil Reserves Agency, which maintains Ireland's strategic oil reserves, is not included in the proposed sale and will continue to operate in the State sector.</P>
    <P>The process of finding new arrangements to underpin the refinery has been going on since early in 1999. In approving a major investment in the refinery, the Government wanted all options for commercialising the operation considered afresh and requested INPC to scope out all the possibilities.</P>
    <P>An extensive search process was carried out by INPC in response to the Government's request. INPC's detailed evaluation of the various proposals received confirmed that the bid submitted by the Tosco Corporation was by far the most advantageous to the State in both financial and strategic terms. This conclusion was subsequently endorsed by the independent consultants engaged to advise the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance in the matter. INPC was accordingly authorised to enter into heads of agreement with Tosco to confer preferred bidder status and to facilitate negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Tosco proposal, which has been refined in the course of the extensive discussions which have taken place between all of the parties in the interim, involves the payment of a gross consideration of US$100 million, although the net proceeds to the State will be less, after taking account of a number of factors, including the retention of INPC's existing debt and the costs associated with a proposed ESOP for the work force.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, Tosco is undertaking to operate the refinery and the terminal for at least 15 years on a purely commercial basis, without the benefit of the mandatory regime or any other kind of artificial support, while maintaining existing jobs and conditions of employment. This is in marked contrast to the situation that has applied since the State got involved with Whitegate in 1982. Since then, because of the reliance on the mandatory regime, which is subject to annual review, a Minister with responsibility for energy has not ever been in a position to guarantee the future of the refinery from one year to the next. Crucially, the new owners have indicated that they will be in a position to meet the increased investments required at INPC going forward. <Col N="356" /> With tougher and more stringent environmental rules coming into effect in the future significant sums will be required for INPC in order for the company to meet oil product emission standards. Tosco Corporation has the experience and the resources to ensure that the new exacting standards for refining oil products will be met.</P>
    <P>The transaction includes the normal allocation of responsibility for ongoing environmental liability for a transaction of this kind. The time available does not permit me to go into detail, but we can be quite open about it on another occasion.</P>
    <P>While the proposed transaction as it now stands represents a balance of the interests of the various parties, there are clear advantages for INPC, for the work force and for the economy generally. Assuming the sale proceeds to completion, it will provide a solid basis for refining and terminal activities for at least 15 years and will offer security and career development opportunities for the employees in the context of a major oil industry undertaking without the need for artificial support measures. From a national strategic perspective, the contribution which these facilities make to security and diversity of supply will be underpinned for the foreseeable future at least cost to taxpayers and consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, intends to bring forward legislative proposals before the summer recess to empower her to discharge certain functions without which the proposed transaction cannot proceed to completion. This will provide an opportunity for the House to debate the proposed transaction and, I hope, be convinced of its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>With a general election less than 12 months away, I am glad that it is the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, a fellow Cork man, who will reply to this debate, because the single biggest issue in that campaign in Cork will be the condition of the roads. I have rarely seen the level of anger and frustration of local communities all over my constituency and all over County Cork at the condition of the roads and the perception that we are not getting our fair share of the cake. In raising this matter here, I lay the blame fairly and squarely at the door of the Government, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply to a parliamentary question I tabled late last year shows clearly that Cork County Council has received the lowest allocation per kilometre of public road of any local authority over each of the past five years. Having got that information, I spoke to the Cork county manager, the county engineer and a number of senior executive engineers in the county council and the council sent a detailed submission to the Department on 10 May last. I will deal in some detail <Col N="357" /> with the contents of that submission. The letter from which I wish to quote was sent by the Cork county manager to Mr. Niall Callan, assistant secretary of the roads division of the Department. I am sure the Minister of State will accept that the county manager is not given to exaggeration. His submission is based on facts. The letter states that Appendix A in the submission shows the results of Cork County Council's examination of the county's non-national roads network broken down into the council's three divisions, and that it shows that 53% of the network is substandard and, in its present condition, requires £230.7 million of expenditure to bring it up to standard at current prices.</P>
    <P>At the current rate of grant allocation, and assuming that the roads do not dis-improve, it will take between 14 to 22 years in the three divisions to bring the roads up to standard. This council has expended the following sums out of its own resources to fund over-expenditures on the restoration programme rather than cutback on the length of restorations &ndash; 1998, £282,000; 1999, £995,000; 2000, £918,000. This expenditure is in addition to the present annual spend of £15.5 million of council's own resources on the maintenance of the non-national road network.</P>
    <P>This assessment taken in conjunction with our analysis of the published list of country-wide allocations, shows that Cork County Council is not receiving an equitable proportion of the national allocation. In 2001, Cork County Council will receive only 77% of the national average allocation per kilometre. In 2001, Cork County Council will receive only 25% of the allocation of Kildare County Council.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Kildare County Council has a total number of kilometres of 2,086, while Cork County Council has 11,582 kilometres:</P>
    <P>Our actual allocation for 2001 is £26.98 million. If Cork County Council had been treated in accordance with the national average, or with three selected counties, its allocation would be as follows: the national average is £4.8 million; Monaghan County Council, £46.4 million; Meath County Council, £55.6 million; Kildare County Council, £109.4 million.</P>
    <P>Based on the assessment which the council has carried out, this would mean an annual allocation of £102 million at current prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government wrote to me on 13 February, 2001: </P>
    <P>For your information I have recently announced a record grant of almost £27 million in non-national road grants for Cork County Council in 2001. This represents an increase of 15% on the initial road grant to the county last year. I am confident that this substantial increase will provide the necessary support to the county for much-needed works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The reality is that the allocation is £27 million, the assessed needs are £102 million. Much of the damage is in the Blarney area office, an area well-known to the Minister of State, the Blarney to Killarney route that goes from Blarney onwards to Macroom, the road from Coachford to the Angler's Rest, the road from Cloghroe onwards towards Donoughmore, Crean's Cross to Coachford. The Minister of State knows all these roads, they are in a disastrous condition. The Minister of State's Department cannot continue to discriminate against Cork County Council in the fashion that it has. As a Corkman, the Minister of State's performance has been abysmal and he has twelve months to rectify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before turning to the specific issue raised in relation to Cork County Council, I avail of this opportunity to outline the progress being made in the significant resourcing of non-national roads.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year a record provision for non-national roads of £319 million for 2001 was announced. This was an increase of £150 million or just over 21% on the original 1997 allocation. In making this provision the Government was again delivering, as it had in previous years on its commitment to ensure an adequate financial base for the non-national roads programme.</P>
      <P>This has been copper-fastened by the national development plan which provides that there will be expenditure of at least £1.9 billion at current prices in the 2000 to 2006 period. What this means is that there will be significant expenditure on non-national roads in each of the years covered by the NDP. It is guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme, which aims to restore regional and local roads in county council areas by the end of 2005, continues to be the cutting edge of the non-national roads effort; the funds available for this programme have increased from more than £20 million in 1995 to more than £162 million this year. This provision greatly increased the rate of progress being made in the restoration of regional and county roads to an acceptable standard. To date, 15,346 restoration improvement schemes have been completed with more than 21,567 kilometres of non-national roads benefiting from improvement. There have been 26,667 restoration maintenance and improvement schemes costing £588 million carried out since the programme began. The Department has recently asked county councils to submit new multi-annual programmes to the Department for the 2002-05 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, I confirm that the Department has received a submission from Cork County Council dated 10 May <Col N="359" /> 2001, seeking additional funding for the council's non-national road network. The council's submission is being examined in my Department and will be responded to in the near future.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council's non-national road grant allocation in 2001 is almost £27 million. This represents an increase of 70% on the council's initial 1997 allocation of £15.8 million. In fact this is the highest allocation countrywide for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Within this allocation, Cork County Council will receive grants of £2.33 million for discretionary maintenance, £1.97 million for discretionary improvement, £13.6 million for restoration improvement and £4.8 million for restoration maintenance which represents increases respectively of 87%, 53%, 80% and 59% on the council's 1997 allocation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Cork County Council was one of ten county councils selected for special grant aid this year to support housing and other related developments. Under this new grant scheme the Government is committed to providing <Col N="360" /> Exchequer funding of more than £5 million to Cork County Council over the period 2001 to 2004 for road infrastructure to support housing and other related development of which £375,000 was allocated in 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, Cork County Council have indicated that it intends spending more than £14 million from its own resources on non-national roads in 2001. This in effect means that the council, in all, will have more than £40 million available to it in 2001 for non-national roads, the highest figure of any county in the country.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that what I have outlined represents a very reasonable approach with significantly increased grants available to Cork County Council in 2001. In determining the 2001 grants, we were conscious to ensure that the increased resources available will equip all authorities appropriately, including Cork County Council, in relation to its ongoing and special needs.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 30 May 2001.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a consultancy which I shortly expect to commission to examine the options that may exist throughout the north Clare area for the facilitation of public access to the Burren National Park and for control of that access. My Department will shortly complete terms of reference for this exercise and tenders will be invited in accordance with standard procedure. The Deputy may be aware that my Department offered £500,000 each to Kilfenora and Corofin towards the development of visitor facilities at those centres. The offer to Kilfenora has been accepted, and work is well advanced on a facility which will, I believe, greatly enhance the appeal of Kilfenora as a tourist destination as well as very effectively informing visitors to the Burren about that unique place. Thus far, the community at Corofin has not been in a position to take up this offer. However, the offer remains open and I will carefully consider any viable proposal put to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 80 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council's report on stone monuments is being examined in my Department at present and I anticipate that my officials will be making arrangements to meet with representatives of the council to discuss it and other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report needs to be put in a context. For example, stone monuments are by their nature, largely ruinous and have in most cases been in decay for many hundreds of years. It must also be remembered that when the State first became involved in the preservation of monuments in the middle of the 19th century and indeed up to quite <Col N="363" /> recent times, the practices and materials used in the conservation of monuments were understood at the time to be best conservation practice. It is only in recent decades that the damage caused by the likes of portland cement-based mortars has become apparent. Nevertheless, as the report indicates, even the use of cement may have arrested the structural decay of some of our monuments, particularly those of the harder limestone construction. This is an inherited problem and even with best conservation practice, which is slow and painstaking by its nature, the problems will not be remedied overnight.</P>
    <P>The rate of decay relates to the type of stone used in the construction so that, for example, soft sandstone monuments are more affected than limestone monuments. This is particularly true in the case of the finer carved detailing on many of the sites assessed in the report. Intensive damage is often caused by higher vegetal species such as ivy and trees but the remedy does not require costly specialist interventions.</P>
    <P>The report assesses only 112 monuments but there are over 120,000 monuments in the State. Furthermore it is not safe to assume until the report is examined in detail that up to 27,000 stone structures and monuments are significantly damaged or suffering neglect.</P>
    <P>In November last year I announced a major investment of over £100 million in the built heritage under the national development plan, which included an unprecedented level of commitment to the conservation of national monuments in the care of the State. Given the above context I should emphasise that the State, through Dúchas the Heritage Service of my Department, has been to the fore in stone conservation practice in caring for the 740 monuments in State ownership.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council published the report and, although it is a statutorily independent body, I will ask them to forward a copy to the Oireachtas Library to be available to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>In its recently published report for 1999, the National Archives Advisory Council reiterated its concern at the failure of some Departments to transfer records to the National Archives as required by the National Archives Act, 1986, and referred in particular to two Departments which still hold large quantities of pre-1960 records that are overdue for transfer. I share the council's concern with regard to the transfer of records. I understand that the position <Col N="364" /> in relation to one Department will be substantially improved when a major transfer takes place later this year and that the National Archives is currently reviewing the position with regard to such records with the second Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 329 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware, no doubt, that last November I announced a major investment of over £100 million in the built heritage under the national development plan, including an unprecedented commitment to the continued conservation and protection, in the period up to 2006, of the sizeable portfolio of over 740 national monuments and historic properties in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. Having conducted a detailed review of the properties under my control I have identified in excess of 100 sites, which will require major work from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view, to be funded during the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, the Deputy may also be aware that the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and funded by my Department, operates a buildings at risk register for heritage buildings of architectural significance. The register informs the administration by the Heritage Council of its architectural grant scheme where buildings in need of essential repairs are grant-aided. I understand that the council is making available £1.5 million under this scheme in 2001. Details of the grants provided by the Heritage Council under this scheme are contained in its annual report.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May of 1998, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the package of proposals for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage. That package, which is being implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms, rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As part of the package, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government launched, in 1999, a grant scheme for the conservation of protected structures, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of legislative provisions also contribute to the protection of the architectural heritage. These include section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which allows tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, <Col N="366" /> maintenance or restoration of approved buildings; the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, under which a nationwide survey is being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest; and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, which places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future.</P>

      <P>My objective in relation to Dublin, and indeed the country in general outside the Gaeltacht, as regards the Irish language is to promote bilingualism in the broadest meaning of that term. Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish Language Agency of the North-South Language Body, is charged with the promotion of the Irish language on an all-island basis. An Foras is active in promoting the Irish language in Dublin and I understand that Dublin Corporation, in conjunction with An Foras, has employed an Irish language officer to implement a language action plan and promotional, advertising, marketing, advice, financial and other assistance is provided by An Foras to individuals, businesses, organisations and other groups in the Dublin area for the promotion of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Ciste na Gaeilge is a fund administered by my Department which assists Irish language projects and organisations outside the Gaeltacht. Funding has been provided to organisations and projects in Dublin in the past and worthwhile applications from Dublin will be considered in the future. A grant of £40,000 from Ciste na Gaeilge was approved for Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge in 1999 towards the cost of a feasibility study on a major language project, Baile Átha Cliath le Gaeilge, for the Dublin area. Work is in progress in relation to that study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of my reply to the Priority Question on <Col N="367" /> the commencement of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, subsection (4) of section 1 of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Minister must sign a commencement order before the Act comes into effect. The commencement order may refer to specified provisions or be general in nature but must specify a day or days on which the Act or the specified provisions come into operation.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to make an order bringing the whole Act into effect shortly. However, the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to address certain practical arrangements before this can be done. In this context I met with the Independent Radio and Television Commission on 26 March 2001 to discuss many of the issues arising from the enactment of the legislation. In addition, my Department has been in consultation with the Independent Radio and Television Commission with regard to the financial and staffing resources which it estimates it will require when it assumes the responsibilities of the new broadcasting commission of Ireland to fulfil its statutory remit. The Independent Radio and Television Commission has made a submission seeking additional resources and my Department is currently examining the submission with a view to securing the necessary sanction for the additional resources needed to carry out its new functions.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the commencement of the Act, the Government has recently appointed four additional members to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC. Members of the BCC who are serving at the time of the commencement order will continue to serve as members following commencement. The appointment of four new members is in line with the requirement in section 22(6) of the Act that, with a nine member commission, a minimum of four members must be women and a minimum of four members must be men.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Act, 2001, also provides me with enabling powers to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity. However, as I have said previously in this House, there are many complex issues to be addressed and I do not believe it would be appropriate to establish the station as a separate statutory entity until such issues are resolved satisfactorily. I expect that the process of establishing Teilifís na Gaeilge as an independent concern will take a number of years.</P>

      <P>There are currently no EU directives awaiting implementation by my Department. With regard to the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), the European Commission has initiated proceedings against Ireland in the European Court of Justice, essentially for late transmission of our full list of sites. Similar cases were taken against France and Germany. There was an oral hearing of this case in January. Although counsel for the Commission made favourable mention of the recent progress made by Ireland, the case was not withdrawn. The advocate general's report is expected to be delivered very soon.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC), the Commission has initiated proceedings against Ireland in connection with overgrazing and the decline of red grouse in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg complex, a special protection area under the EU Birds Directive. Implementation of the rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the implementation of farm plans prepared by my Department, taking account of commonage framework plans, will address the overgrazing situation. With our legal advisers we have prepared a defence of our position in these proceedings, which have not yet reached a court hearing.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a proposed development of social housing consisting of 40 dwellings in Shandon, Dungarvan, County Waterford. The area is of archaeological potential and Dungarvan UDC who are carrying out the development are well aware of this and wish to comply with best practices in mitigating any archaeological impacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is a large site it was agreed by the developer to break it down into a number of zones for archaeological monitoring purposes. So far one report has been received arising from first phase archaeological monitoring of the area encompassing proposed dwellings Nos. 35 to 40. A series of pits were uncovered together with a small sub-circular structure, which appears to have been a temporary dwelling or shelter associated with the pits. The pits were a series of smelting pits, which seem to have produced large amounts of ore. Some surface flint was also <Col N="369" /> found. The site was fully excavated and recorded before being released for development.</P>
    <P>On 24 May my Department received a draft report arising from a second phase of monitoring in the area of proposed dwellings Nos. 27 to 32. First indications are that there is a structure of archaeological interest at this location, possibly a medieval moated site or pre-historic site. The matter is being assessed by the UDC, its consultant archaeologist and my officials to work out the best mitigation strategy for this find.</P>

      <P>To determine which rivers in Ireland best meet the required scientific standards for special areas of conservation for salmon, staff of my Department consulted widely, particularly with the central and regional fisheries boards. I am satisfied that this has resulted in extensive information on salmon distribution and abundance being brought to bear on the selection of rivers to be proposed as SACs for salmon. On the basis of this information it has been concluded that the River Liffey does not meet the required standard. I do not therefore intend to propose it for designation as a special area of conservation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, agreed to the removal of the vessel from Kilmainham Gaol and that it could be retained thereafter by the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project, my Department agreed to its storage by the group subject to the provision of appropriate accommodation, satisfactory to the National Museum of Ireland, for the ketch. The <Col N="370" /> housing of the <i>Asgard</i> at the car park of the Point Depot was examined by officials of the National Museum of Ireland. It was concluded that the accommodation provided was most unsatisfactory and a formal notice to this effect was issued by the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The ARP has re-housed the vessel in a more secure location in the docks area. The current arrangements satisfy the requirements of the museum in relation to accommodation for the time being.</P>

      <P>My Department's responsibility in the film area relates to the granting of certificates under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This is a tax-based incentive scheme aimed at encouraging investment in film production in the State. The Deputy will be aware that following consideration of the strong case put forward by me on the basis of the review group's report, the Minister for Finance in budget 2000 agreed to an unprecedented extension of the current section 481 tax relief scheme until April 2005 and increased the limits on the amounts production companies can raise under this scheme.</P>
      <P>In the year 2000, a total of 28 such projects which are not described as international or otherwise were certified under this scheme, 18 of which were films and ten were for TV broadcast. It is not possible to state definitively how many projects actually started in 2000.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to the number of jobs created in the sector are compiled on an annual basis by the Audio-visual Federation of IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. I understand the statistics for 2000 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The national monuments and architectural protection division of my Department has five monuments in its care in the area of the Inishowen Peninsula in County Donegal, the best known of these sites being An Grianán of Aileach. The Deputy will be aware that there has been considerable damage in recent times to this site caused by a number of factors including extreme weather conditions, vandalism and visitors taking stones as souvenirs. Conscious of the importance of this site my Department commenced essential repair and conservation work on site this month. It had been intended that this work would commence in early March but restrictions as a result of the threat from foot and mouth disease prevented this from going ahead until recently. I expect that all necessary work at the site will be completed by the end of August. Other national monuments in the Inishowen area in the care of my Department are Carndonagh Cross, Clonca Church and Cross, Pluck Standing Stone and O'Doherty's Keep. Although there are no planned works for these sites at present, my Department is committed to carrying out routine maintenance work as required.</P>

      <P>Last year the Government agreed revised arrangements as provided for in the Broadcasting Act, 2001, for the introduction of digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; in Ireland. These revised arrangements provide that the DTT platform will be established by two separate but inter-linked transactions: (a) the separation out and sale by RTE of the existing RTE transmission network as a going concern and subject to RTE being able to retain a shareholding of up to 28% in the new entity; and (b) the selection of the DTT multiplex company, the DTT retail business, to be licensed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental project management group chaired by my Department and including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Public Enterprise is managing the process to select the DTT multiplex company. A consortium of advisers headed by <Col N="378" /> AIB Corporate Finance is executing that process under the direction of the project management group. The public phase of the selection process commenced in the week ending 18 May when advertisements were placed in national and international newspapers inviting interested parties to participate in the process to be selected as the DTT multiplex company.</P>
    <P>I understand from RTE that the public phase of its transmission network sale process has also begun and that RTE's advisers commenced the distribution of its pre-sale document to interested parties on 11 May.</P>

      <P>The European Union habitats directive requires member states to propose, on the basis of specified scientific criteria, relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date Ireland has proposed 362 sites as candidate SACs. This represents a total area of 9,907 square kilometres. In view of the varying sizes of member states, and of individual SACs, it is not very useful to compare numbers of sites. To compare national lists of candidate special areas of conservation, the standard approach adopted by the EU Commission is to express the total extent <Col N="380" /> of candidate SACs in each country, including marine areas, as a percentage of the land area of the country. Ireland's proposals, by this calculation, amount to 14.1% of the area of the country. According to recent information from the EU, this would rank us seventh among the 15 EU member states, and slightly above the overall figure for the EU of 13.1%.</P>
    <P>One should not attach too much importance to such figures, in view of the differing types and conditions of natural areas across Europe. I am satisfied that the extent of our proposals, and the procedures we have followed, particularly in allowing time for consideration of landowners concerns, provide the basis for very effective implementation of the habitats directive in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Deputy is referring to the Sandymount Strand-Tolka Estuary special protection area, SPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State owned foreshore areas of Sandymount Strand and the Tolka Basin were designated as an SPA under the EU birds directive in March 1994 as part of a process to designate all qualifying parts of Dublin Bay as SPA. Another major area within Dublin Bay, the North Bull Island, had been separately designated as an SPA in February 1986. Subsequently, survey and censuses of waterfowl clearly indicated that other areas of Dublin Bay qualified on scientific grounds to be included in the SPA. These areas, mainly intertidal waterfowl-feeding grounds, of Dublin Bay had not been included in the original designation <Col N="381" /> but are important for large numbers and variety of waterfowl, especially Pale-bellied Brent Geese and various species of waders.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in July 1999 my Department advertised a proposal to extend the Sandymount Strand-Tolka Estuary Special Protection Area, SPA. Arising out of this, the Dublin Port Authority contacted my Department to discuss the SPA boundary<i> vis-à-vis</i>, their proposals to extend the port facilities. The detailed extent of the SPA proposal was closely examined in the context of an environmental impact assessment of their development proposals. This EIA established that at extreme low spring tides, twice each month, a very small area of intertidal mudflats is exposed in the particular area affected by Dublin Port's proposal for port extension. Only common and adaptable species of birds feed opportunistically on this infrequently exposed area. On consideration of these facts, and taking account of the numbers and species of birds recorded using the small area exposed at extreme low tides, and its very limited availability as a feeding area, it was concluded that the inclusion of an area of 11 acres in the SPA was not warranted and its loss to the proposed port extension would not be significant in the context of the entirety of Dublin Bay's intertidal habitat. The total area of the Sandymount Strand-Tolka Estuary SPA including the recent addition is 4,200 acres &ndash; 1,700 hectares. It should be pointed out that most of the 52 acres of the proposed port extension is permanently covered by water and was never considered or proposed for inclusion in the SPA. The definitive SPA &ndash; as subsequently incorporated in the statutory instrument &ndash; was published in February 2000.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware there has been considerable damage to An Grianán of Aileach caused by a number of factors including extreme weather conditions, subsidence, vandalism and visitors to the site taking stones as souvenirs. The most recent recorded damage at the site was over the weekend of 7 January 2001 when fencing erected by my Department was uprooted, stones from the monument hurled across the site and stainless steel information plaques torn from their plinths. Obviously the sheer scale of the vandalism which occurred that weekend is a worry for, not only my Department, but for anyone who cares about the heritage of our country.</P>
      <P>Following on from the damage and vandalism to which I have just referred, my Department had intended to undertake essential repair work to the monument in early March but because of concerns regarding foot and mouth disease the commencement of this work had to be delayed. However, with the easing of foot and mouth restrictions, work commenced on the site earlier this month. I fully expect all the necessary work to be completed by the end of August.</P>
      <P>For health and safety reasons, during the repair work it is necessary to limit access to the site and to this end my Department has secured the agreement of Donegal County Council for a temporary closure of the access road to the monument for the period of the works. However, conscious that the site is an important one my Department will ensure that access to the monument is maintained for visitors from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Holy Well at An Grianán my officials recently met representatives of the local community and arrangements are now being made to undertake repair work to this part of the site.</P>

      <P>Eligible categories of persons, including both women and men, for the social economy programme are much wider than those on the live register. The full listing of categories of persons eligible for the social economy programme is outlined as follows. There is also a 10% exemption limit for other disadvantaged persons who do not meet the normal eligibility criteria, including women in low income welfare dependent households. This exemption may be applied to the total number of grant-aided persons employed across social economy enterprises.</P>
      <P>Eligible grant-aided employees are: unemployed persons over 35 years of age in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or one parent family payment for at least three years; persons in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension or blind persons pension, and persons in receipt of disability benefit for six months or more who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature; a Traveller, of any age in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or one parent family payment for one year or more. In the case of travellers under 18 years of age, a minimum of 12 months spent in a Travellers' training centre will suffice for eligibility; qualified adults &ndash; adult dependants &ndash; over 35 years of age of long-term unemployed persons and persons over 35 years in receipt of a widows-widowers contributory and non-contributory pension, carer's allowance, deserted wives benefit, subject to application of a qualifying period for eligibility as with unemployed persons and lone parents.</P>
      <P>Note (1) Time spent on community employment or job initiative and/or recognised training course will count towards eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Note (2) Time spent in prison will count as part of the eligibility period. Ex-offenders need not <Col N="387" /> be signing on the Live Register at time of recruitment.</P>
    <P>Note (3) Casual workdays of up to 90 days in the previous three years will be allowed.</P>
    <P>Grant supported employment in a social economy enterprise may be full or part-time but employees must meet the criteria as outlined above, apart from the 10% exemption facility.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to make any meaningful estimate of the cost to business of updating data processing systems for the changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002. The following are some of the main issues which would preclude any meaningful estimate: every business operation is unique and consequently individual business needs will vary depending on the management of that business and the needs it perceives; costs are likely to vary substantially depending on the timing of actions by business management to update data processing systems e.g. actions taken now can be planned to greater effect, and the least cost options can be identified, whereas actions left until the end of this year are likely to prove considerably more costly to implement; many businesses may use the opportunity of the euro changeover as a rationale for updating their data processing systems generally, notwithstanding the fact that actual requirements for the euro changeover may be considerably less in monetary terms by comparison.</P>

      <P>Participation on CE is normally for a period of one to three years depending on the person's age and unemployment status.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 25 or over who have been one year unemployed may participate in CE for a maximum period of three years. This period cannot be continuous. Participants are required to have a break of twelve months after each year of service. To return to CE after the year break the person must have been unemployed for the period of the break. In special circumstances where a participant will benefit from two years continuously, 10% of participants in this category may do two years in succession.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 35 or over who have been unemployed for a period of three years may participate in CE for three years continuous. The maximum period, currently, is three years for all.</P>
      <P>Occasionally, arrangements are made in very exceptional circumstances to accommodate participants who would benefit from a further term on the programme outside the usual criteria, for example, drugs task force projects.

      <P>Community employment or CE is a work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and-or further education and training. The programme is designed to provide temporary rather than ongoing opportunities for persons unemployed for a minimum of 12 months. There are currently approximately 33,400 participants on the programme. CE supervisors and participants are employed by the sponsors of projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. Within the context of the overall number of places avail<Col N="389" /> able on CE, FÁS has operational responsibility for the delivery of the programme.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in July 1999 to restructure the programme the numbers employed on CE are reducing to 28,000 by the end of 2003. The reduction in absolute numbers participating, together with the changed eligibility criteria are considered to be appropriate given the present economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections.</P>
      <P>Consultations with relevant Departments are currently taking place in order to progress the mainstreaming of essential services currently undertaken by participants on the CE programme. This will further reduce participation levels. The mainstreaming of these services should enhance the services being provided and provide employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Department of Education and Science with regard to schools services are at an advanced stage and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to that Department in time for the new school year in September next.</P>
      <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a new high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with particular employment barriers. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly and I would hope that this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>
      <P>My Department is also considering with FÁS the issue of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on CE, and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will also be considered in the context of developing policy for the high supports process, and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of CE following the mainstreaming of essential services.</P>
      <P>Community groups currently availing of CE who wish to convert to social economy activity can avail of financial grants and technical supports available under this programme to employ former CE participants, among others, in social economy projects. Social economy support is available to communities that can provide for a social need and generate an income from this activity.</P>
      <P>CE will remain a substantial programme for the foreseeable future. However, in the context of labour shortages and the dramatic reductions in the numbers of long-term unemployed I believe we must continue to gradually reduce the overall numbers participating on active labour market programmes. This can be achieved through a process of mainstreaming jobs and targeting available resources at those most in need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1998 FÁS has responded to factory closures in Donegal by implementing a tried and tested process of individual interaction with each interested worker who has been made redundant. This interaction takes the form of a quality registration interview. The process enables FÁS to carry out a skills and training needs analysis, which it uses to set-up training initiatives that are matched to both the worker's needs and to the identified needs of local industry. The skills analysis produced by FÁS is made available to all the relevant bodies in Donegal to assist in the attraction of new industry. For the client, a dedicated employment services officer puts a personal action plan in place. This action plan takes the form of training, retraining, work practice, a job or other employability measures.</P>
      <P>The problem for older workers obtaining new skills is not just confined to County Donegal or indeed, Ireland, but is a European-wide problem. FÁS responds to older workers that are referred by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the Government's employment action plan as they reach a threshold duration of unemployment. The aim of this plan for older workers is to prevent long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operate a back to work allowance scheme and a back to work enterprise allowance scheme to help long-term unemployed people get back in to the work force. The back to work enterprise allowance scheme is administered by local partnership companies and to date this scheme has helped up to 400 people set up their own employment in the Inishowen area alone.</P>

      <P>The basic research grant scheme, which is directed at supporting high-quality basic research projects, in the third level sector, with a particular emphasis on the training of new graduates, is an essential element of this Government's research, technological development and innovation strategy. This scheme has been expanded considerably in recent years, from a base of £0.83 million in 1994. This expansion is in line with the recommendations contained in the independent review of the scheme carried out by Technopolis in 1997. The amount of £6.32 million for new projects which has been approved for the basic research grant scheme this year, represents a substantial increase of 35% on the £4.68 million funding approved last year.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this increase in commitments, it is true that the success rate for projects under this scheme is just under 15% this year, compared to 19% in 2000. This arises however from the substantial increase in funding granted to individual projects, with an average cost of £91,000 per project, compared to £55,000 last year, and an increase in the number of projects submitted for consideration. The benefit of this increase in funding for individual projects is that principal investigators will be in a position to take on both a post-graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher. As a consequence, more individual researchers will be supported under the scheme this year, compared to 2000. The increased funding per project also has consequential beneficial effects, in that it provides for an increase in the level of payments to researchers. This will make it easier to attract research students and post-doctoral fellows of the highest calibre and ensure that they remain with projects, for their duration.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of this scheme is to train researchers and develop a good research base, here in Ireland. We are confident that the funding provided for basic research under the scheme and under the many other measures, provided for in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, will ensure that this objective is met.</P>

    <P>The 2000 allocation amounts to £233 million, 295.8 million, which represents a very significant increase over the expenditure in the previous years. This increase is part of the Government's strategy as outlined in the national development plan, 2000-2006, to invest substantially in research and development as a key economic instrument.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that Forfás undertakes separate biennial surveys on the level of research and development performed in the higher education and business sectors in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The latest data available on business sector research and development relates to the year 1997. The 1999 survey is ongoing. The 1997 data shows expenditure of £535 million. This represents 1.1% of GDP, which is around the EU average.</P>

      <P>The provision of jobs in any area is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies, and not one for which I as Minister would have a direct function.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Shannon and Ennis areas have recently experienced closures or downsizing of companies. However, both IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for the promotion of these areas for overseas and indigenous industry, respectively, are actively engaged in attracting new industry to Shannon and Ennis. Both agencies also work with existing companies in an effort to develop and encourage expansion of their businesses.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development has established the &ldquo;Industry Ennis&rdquo; initiative, a dynamic partnership involving Shannon Development, Eircom Ennis Information Age Town, IDA, Clare County Council, Ennis UDC, Ennis Chamber of Commerce, Clare Chamber of Industry, Clare Enterprise Board, FÁS and the local business community.</P>
      <P>The partnership is committed to providing world class conditions for the digital economy to flourish in Ennis and includes a marketing campaign designed to create opportunities for hi-tech investment and jobs. The &lsquo;Industry Ennis' initiative has generated considerable interest and the partnership is in discussion with a number of both indigenous and foreign owned potential projects.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shannon Development has recently acquired the campus of Our Lady's Hospital, comprising 70 acres of land. The company will retain 30 acres for the development of a state of the art technology park. The park will comprise 750,000 sq.ft. of quality office type accommodation with the potential to employ 3,500 people. It is expected that the information age park will be developed over a ten year period, with the first buildings coming on stream in 2002. IDA Ireland will market the park to foreign companies considering Ireland as a location in which to invest.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development also has overall responsibility for the development of indigenous and overseas industry at the Shannon Free Zone. As of December 2000, there were 133 companies on Shannon Free Zone employing 8,058 people in a wide and diversified base of industry. Shannon Development continues to work with existing companies to help them grow and diversify and with new overseas clients with a view to their establishing on Shannon Free Zone.</P>
      <P>IDA-supported companies in Clare currently employ over 1,140 people. Eight of these companies are based in Ennis and employ more than 770 people. IDA also continues to promote Ennis and its information town status through its network of overseas offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of training services by FÁS, I am advised that FÁS services were offered to the companies in Ennis experi<Col N="396" /> encing difficulties. FÁS services are made available to all employees who wish to use them. These services consist of registration, employment seeking, training opportunities, guidance and counselling. Progress towards re-employment of all the former employees of these companies who registered with FÁS will be monitored by the agency.</P>
    <P>The agencies will continue their efforts to attract replacement projects to areas affected by major job losses and to assist the development and expansion of existing industry in those areas. Every effort will be made to assist the workers affected to find alternative employment and to provide retraining, where appropriate, to enhance employment prospects.</P>

      <P>I have noted the further correspondence sent to me by the Deputy in relation to the committee representing the fishermen and licence holders during the relevant period. I have asked my Department to consult with the relevant regional fisheries board responsible for licensing &ndash; the Southern Regional Fishery Board &ndash; based on all the information furnished by the Deputy and the details given in my replies based on information provided by the Port of Waterford Harbour Company.</P>
      <P>My Department will then review the position with the harbour company. However I would not like to raise any false hopes in the matter as this is primarily a matter for decision by the Harbour Company as an independent commercial State company.</P>

    <P>We have stated our position that the economic and development needs of the people of Iraq do not have to be put on hold pending full compliance with the Security Council resolutions and that we wish to see the system operate so as to allow these needs to be met fully within the constraints required to ensure that Iraq does not seek further to develop weapons of mass destruction or threaten its neighbours. In this regard the new proposals appear to be a step in the right direction. However, we will need to examine them carefully.</P>
    <P>It remains the Government's wish to see the lifting of the UN economic sanctions against Iraq altogether. To bring this about it is necessary for Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations disarmament supervisory commission and to demonstrate, with concrete evidence, its peaceful intentions, especially with regard to its neighbours.</P>

      <P>The Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights &ndash; ODIHR &ndash; is the institution within the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe &ndash; OSCE &ndash; responsible for the organisation of election observation missions in Europe. On 9 May ODIHR sent out a request to all participating OSCE member states for 18 long-term observers and 150 short-term observers as staff for the election observation mission for the parliamentary elections in the Republic of Albania, to be held on 24 June 2001.</P>
      <P>In line with Ireland's joint commitment, together with other member states of the European Union and the OSCE, to supporting newly democratic states and in line with our practice of ensuring participation by Irish personnel in recent election observation missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia, Ireland will be sending five short-term observers to take part in this mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with standard practice, these observers will be nominated by the Agency for Personnel Services Overseas &ndash; APSO &ndash; which is an autonomous body operating as part of Ireland's overseas development assistance programme and funded from Ireland's bilateral aid allocation. APSO selects election observers for each mission from a register of suitable and avail<Col N="401" /> able candidates which it maintains. Criteria applied include relevant experience, the area to be monitored and gender balance.</P>
    <P>Observers receive no remuneration but are provided with sufficient funds to cover the cost of return flights to Albania, hotel accommodation while there, payment of drivers and interpreters and subsistence expenses. An indicative estimate of total costs per observer has not yet been received from ODIHR but is expected to be in the region of IR£1,200.</P>
    <P>In response to a specific request from ODIHR, Ireland will also be providing part of the funding for the deployment of an Irish expert as security advisor to the election observer mission.</P>

      <P>The promotion of Ireland's trade in overseas markets is among the highest priorities of my Department. Under my direction, this important work is carried out by the Department in close collaboration with our network of diplomatic and consular missions abroad, and with other Departments and State agencies at home. In certain of our missions, trade promotion is significantly enhanced by representatives of Enterprise Ireland, specifically appointed for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Ireland has in recent years accelerated its programme for the opening of embassies in states with which Ireland has, or aims to have, increased trade, economic and political relations. In line with the Government's Asia strategy, our diplomatic presence in South East Asia and Australia has been augmented to avail of the growing economic opportunities emerging there. A new embassy has been established in Singapore and new consulates general in Shanghai and Sydney. In addition, the staffing of the embassies in Tokyo and Beijing have been strengthened. It is hoped to continue this programme of opening embassies in states with which Ireland has growing trade relations over the coming years as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> In terms of overall numbers, Ireland has 60 diplomatic offices abroad consisting of 45 bilateral embassies, ten consulates general and other offices, as well as five multilateral missions. A breakdown of these including the number of staff employed is given in annex 1.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has recently completed work to upgrade the rail route between Maynooth and Connolly. This work involved constructing a double track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, resignalling the line and providing new station buildings at all stations including Castleknock, Coolmine and Clonsilla in Dublin 15. The introduction of new services has been delayed pending the resolution of certain industrial relations issues. These issues are currently before the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, strategy for 2000 to 2016 &ldquo;Platform for Change&rdquo; has recommended further upgrading of the Maynooth to Connolly route, such as the electrification of the line, the removal of level crossings and the reconfiguration of Connolly station, to permit an even higher frequency of service. The estimated cost of the further upgrading of the Maynooth to Connolly line is approximately £200 million. Iarnród Éireann is currently assessing the DTO proposals.</P>
    <P>In July 2000, the Government approved, in principle, the development of a metro system for Dublin on a public private partnership basis. Following the Government decision, I asked the light rail project office, LRPO, of CIE to commence the necessary preparatory work on the proposed metro system. Some initial work has been undertaken and a suggested alignment for the metro involving the provision of services to a number of areas in Dublin, including Dublin 15, has been drawn up.</P>
    <P>The LRPO of CIE is currently engaged in a public consultation process on the metro and my Department is currently undertaking a consultation exercise to elicit reaction from potential bidders. The market consultation document, on which the exercise is based, also describes the initial thinking on routing options, initial costings and the physical and engineering options for the metro. In relation to routing, it identifies the line to Blanchardstown as an early priority for development. The responses received will be taken into account when formulating a policy on PPPs and will assist in the metro procurement process which I expect to proceed later in the year.</P>

      <P>Subject to feasibility studies, the Operational Programme for Economic and Social Infrastructure has earmarked funds for additional diesel railcars in respect of commuter services and possible new stations in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that proposed railway developments in the Cork area are currently being considered by consultants who have been engaged by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council to draw up the Cork Strategic Plan, 2000-2020. The consultants issued an interim report and this, among other things, contained proposals that the area along the rail/land corridor from Blarney <i>via </i>Cork to Midleton be rezoned for major residential and commercial development. These proposals were put forward in the context of proposed major rail developments which would involve the re-opening of the line to Midleton and the opening of a number of railway stations along <Col N="406" /> the line. I am advised that the consultants are close to finalising the report which will then fall to be considered by Iarnród Éireann and my Department.</P>

      <P>The person in question relinquished his commission as an officer of the FCA with effect from 7 August 1956 for the reason that he was below the required physical standards. He had been injured in a road traffic accident in June 1955 while on duty and he subsequently received compensation on foot of a civil action against the driver of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>While he was found eligible at the time for an award of periodic compensation in accordance with the terms of the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personnel Injuries) (Local Defence Force) Scheme, 1942, no payments were actually made to him because the relevant amount of periodic compensation was less than the actuarial value of the compensation which he had received.</P>
      <P>The person is not in receipt of any payments from my Department. I have asked the Department to undertake a review of the case and I will advise the Deputy of the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>As the House will recall, I announced last October that I had decided to proceed with the establishment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces, the appointment of which is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the representative associations, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can add that my Department will shortly be in a position to make proposals to both of the representative associations with a view to defining the scope and powers of a military ombudsman in terms which will meet the divergent needs of the various parties. The discussions which will follow are likely to result in an updating of the existing internal complaints procedures. As soon <Col N="409" /> as those discussions are completed, I will make the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the ombudsman proposal.</P>

      <P>Casement Aerodrome is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnell as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland. I have no plans at present for other developments at the aerodrome. I will, however, keep the matter under review to determine whether greater use might be made of this important resource. I might add that the question of establishing facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>In the past three years there has been a capital investment in excess of £7.5 million in Casement Aerodrome. There are ongoing projects to the value of over £1 million. A design team has been appointed for the construction of a new headquarters for the third support wing which has an estimated cost of £2.3 million, with construction expected to commence in September 2001.</P>

A very simple and basic personnel management system was initially installed in 1987 and since then has undergone many software changes and upgrades.

      <P>Negotiations on agriculture are currently taking place at the WTO under Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture which requires that account be taken, <i>inter alia,</i> of the need for special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to create a fair and market orientated agricultural trading system. The current phase of the negotiations is proceeding on the basis of a work plan agreed at the WTO in March 2001. The plan acknowledges special and differential treatment as an integral part of all elements of the negotiations. Ireland participates in the negotiations as a member of the EU and the Commission is conducting the negotiations on behalf of member states in accordance with a mandate adopted by <Col N="414" /> the Council of Ministers in September 1999. The Council agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, that any new round should provide benefits to developing countries and assist the integration of these countries, particularly the least developed, into the international trade system. The Council has also agreed an EU comprehensive negotiating proposal that addresses the main concerns of developing countries in relation to agricultural trade issues.</P>
      <P>The EU has already decided to give duty-free access to all products exported, except arms, from the 48 poorest developing countries. The TRIPS agreement is a general agreement applying to all economic sectors and is not therefore a part of the current agricultural negotiations. In the event that negotiations take place on the TRIPS agreement, the food production needs of developing countries will be borne in mind in the formation of the EU negotiating position. In relation to capacity building, I am aware that the FAO is providing technical support for developing countries. This reflects a recognition in the international community of the importance of trade issues to food security, as underlined in the conclusions of the World Food Summit in 1996. The Government fully shares that perspective and participates actively in the follow-up process to the WFS, which provides a mechanism for international consultation on food security.</P>
      <P>Ireland has signed an agreement establishing an advisory centre for developing countries on WTO law. Ireland was one of six developed countries which participated in the development of the project, together with 15 developing countries, and has committed itself to contributing $1 million to the endowment fund for the centre with annual contributions of $250,000 for a minimum of five years. The centre will provide advice and assistance for developing countries, in particular the least developed, in defending their trade rights. Finally, the WTO provides for participation by civil society. At national level arrangements are in place for consultation with civil society and these arrangements will continue in the future.</P>

      <P>The position is that applicants under the early retirement scheme must prove their eligibility by satisfying its conditions. If an application is received which does not meet the criteria it cannot be validated until such time as those criteria are met. There is a fundamental difference between the payments made under the various schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the early retirement pension. The former derive from an entitlement based on contributions paid, or on need determined by a person's financial circumstances and entitlement is automatic.</P>

      <P>The BSE crisis in Europe late last year resulted in the loss of third country markets for exports of Irish beef. The task of recovering those markets was made more difficult by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease earlier this year. Nevertheless, every effort is being made at political, diplomatic and technical levels to regain access to all of our traditionally important markets. As the Deputy will be aware, our efforts with regard to the Russian market have been rewarded with the recent Russian decision to lift their ban on imports of livestock and animal products. Diplomatic pressure is being maintained on an ongoing basis in all our markets and is being backed up as appropriate by high-level technical visits by my Department.</P>
      <P>The situation in the various markets is also being monitored by An Bord Bia and there has also been direct contact at veterinary level in regard to a number of markets. The approach to each market is being determined on a case by case basis in conjunction with the advice of An Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs via its embassies in the countries in question. Efforts with regard to Egypt and the Gulf are ongoing. Technical meetings with the Egyptian veterinary authorities took place in Cairo in December 2000 and in April 2001 and with the Saudi authorities in January 2001. There have also been contacts with the South African authorities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the authorities in the countries mentioned have a full appreciation of the level and effectiveness of the BSE controls in place in Ireland. However, ill-informed media reporting on the BSE situation in Europe generally has had an adverse effect on public opinion in those countries and it is clear that a restoration of exports to those markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about the control of BSE in Europe generally. No effort will be spared by the Department or by the other Departments and agencies of the State to ensure that all overseas beef markets are reopened as soon as possible and that every possible opportunity is used to convince importing countries of the safety and quality of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>The total number of BSE cases confirmed here in recent months is broadly similar to that for the corresponding period in 2000. There were 24 cases in the period 1 March 2000 to 31 May 2000 compared to 22 cases from 1 March 2001 to date, although the latter figures include two cases identified under the active surveillance programme which was commenced during 2000. The importation of cattle from the UK has been banned since March 1996. A range of additional control measures was introduced in 1996 and 1997 and that the EU Scientific Steering Committee concluded that the Irish control system has been optimally stable since 1998. That committee also predicted a temporary increase in numbers, up to 2002, of animals infected prior to the measures introduced in 1996 and 1997 taking full effect. It is likely that the number of cases will increase this year mainly due to the increased testing being undertaken on a range of animals including those presented at slaughter plants, knackeries and those dying on farms. However, no animals born after 1996 have been detected with BSE and an ever increasing proportion of confirmed cases are six years of age or more. An extensive range of control measures is in place to protect consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general there is no significant delay between the confirmation of a BSE positive case and the depopulation of the herd. A Department valuer normally makes contact with the herd owner shortly after positive confirmation of BSE with a view to valuation of the herd being carried out on an agreed date, usually within two weeks or less of the date of positive confirmation of the disease. In this particular case BSE was confirmed on 23 November 2000 and the herd was initially valued on 5 December 2000. There is no fixed time frame laid down in legislation for the valuation to be agreed. This is largely a matter for the herd owner who may need time to consider the initial valuation or alternatively may wish to avail of the appeals procedure laid down in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Amendment) (No 2) Order, 1990. The latter provides for recourse to independent valuation and ultimately to an arbitrator, should the herd owner wish to pursue this course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned rejected the Department's initial valuation and opted for an independent valuation. Due to a breakdown of communi<Col N="421" /> cation there was a delay in appointing an independent valuer. In recognition of the difficulty created for the herd owner involved my Department arranged for interim part payment of compensation, to be made on 2 February, prior to depopulation. In addition my Department is finalising arrangements for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to be made to the herd owner in recognition of the inordinate and unique delays in this case. An independent valuer visited the herd owner on 25 January 2001. The herd owner also rejected this valuation. A further valuer was appointed and valuation was finally agreed on 14 February. The herd will normally be slaughtered within one week of the conclusion of the valuation process although this can vary having regard to the size of the herd and the capacity in the sole approved slaughtering plant. Payment normally issues within two weeks of receipt of the relevant documentation.</P>
    <P>However, in February 2000 there was a delay in a small number of cases, including the person concerned, between the date of the agreement on valuation and actual depopulation of the herd. The delay resulted from a backlog in rendering of depopulated herds because of an increase in the volume of specified risk materials following a Commission decision, which added bovine intestines to the list of SRMs. This virtually doubled the volume of SRMs to be rendered at a time when only one rendering plant, with limited capacity, was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for the rendering of these materials. However, the Environmental Protection Agency has, since then, approved two additional rendering plants for this purpose and therefore the Department does not anticipate any further untoward delays in completing depopulation.</P>
    <P>In view of the particular circumstances in this case, the herd owner received additional compensation for a number of calves born between the date of the herd valuation and the date of depopulation. There is no provision for payment of further compensation in this case.</P>

The Sligo district veterinary office is aware of the problems being caused by deer in the Riverstown area and officials there are seeking to set up a co-ordinated strategy involving the relevant agencies and others to address the issue.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that the public health risk, in particular, must be approached with the utmost caution. My Department has not yet carried out such an evaluation and accordingly there are no immediate plans to adjust the current quarantine arrangements.</P>

      <P>It was necessary in the context of the overall management of the FMD situation that sheep grazing on the Curragh be suspended at an early stage of the crisis. With a few exceptions, the co-operation of the flock owners was readily forthcoming. Those who had initially resisted the Department's request, made in the overall national interest of ensuring that everything possible was done to minimise the risk of the spread of FMD, eventually took the responsible course of action. It is not yet appropriate to allow normal movement of sheep to resume. I will keep this matter under review on the basis of advice from the expert group and taking account of prevailing circumstances.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the early retirement scheme, the definition of non-farm income is designed to give every opportunity to potential transferees in the scheme to meet the viability criteria. The VTOS allowance is paid to an unemployed person who wishes to avail of further educational opportunities in lieu of their unemployment benefit or assistance. It is understood that payments may be made by either the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or by the VEC. It is not considered unreasonable, in the circumstances, that such payments should be regarded as income for the purposes of the early retirement scheme in the same way as other social welfare payments. It is understood that nearly 70% of VTOS participants are under the age of 40 and, while there is no breakdown for the numbers over that age, only a small proportion of participants are aged 55 years or over. The inclusion of such payments under the definition of non-farm income is more likely, therefore, to benefit young farmers wishing to participate as transferees under the scheme than to exclude older farmers wishing to retire.</P>

      <P>The definition of non-farm income under the current early retirement scheme includes unemployment benefit and other social welfare benefits and assistance. A feature of such payments is allowances for adult and child dependants. As neither the adult nor the child has independent entitlement to these payments, it is the total amount of benefit or assistance payable which is reckonable as income. The primary purpose of regarding these allowances as non-farm income is to enable potential transferees under the scheme, who may not be in remunerative employment or may be temporarily unemployed, to meet the minimum viability criteria set down.</P>

      <P>The definition of non-farm income under the current early retirement scheme is included at section 3.19 of the scheme document. The definition is very broad and covers income from employment, self-employment, investment income, payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and income from FÁS courses. While income from certain departmental schemes or services are specifically mentioned, this is for information purposes only and should not be construed as excluding all other State payments. During discussions with the farm organisations on the outline of the scheme, it was agreed that farm assist payments, for instance, would be categorised as non-farm income. This was to improve the prospects of small farmers wishing to participate as transferees under the scheme in meeting the viability criteria set down in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Any redefinition of non-farm income would have to apply to both transferors and transferees. While some potential transferors should then become eligible, some younger farmers would be deprived of a chance to remain in farming where they could contribute to maintaining the fabric and viability of rural communities.</P>

The Central Bank is producing over 200 million euro notes and over 1,000 million euro coins which will ensure that there will be enough euro cash to fully replace all active Irish notes and coins. Starter packs of euro coins will go on sale to the public from 17 December 2001 and will be sold at face value, £5. The packs will contain 19 euro coins, including at least one of each denomination, to a total value of 6.35. The packs will be on sale mainly through post offices and limited supplies will also be available at individual banks and building societies and, where feasible, at credit unions for members.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions and, through them, retailers will be supplied with euro cash in advance of 1 January 2002 so that they can give change only in euro from that day. In addition, ATMs will begin to dispense euro notes from that day. It is expected that some 80% of ATMs will be changed over to euro on that day and the rest over the following few days. Under the cash changeover plan for 2002, published last year, 10 and 20 notes will be the predominant notes dispensed by ATMs. Furthermore, social welfare payments will be in euros from 1 January 2002 and, in the first week, will generally include at least four 5 notes. These measures will ensure euro cash goes into circulation quickly. Irish pound notes and coins may remain in circulation and will retain their legal tender status up to the end of the dual circulation period on 9 February 2002.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the changeover to the euro in all 12 countries are ongoing and are kept under constant review by the national authorities, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and Finance Ministers in the euro area.</P>

      <P>Transfers to provincial locations are arranged in accordance with an agreement reached with the staff side at general council under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service. An officer's placing on the transfer list for a particular location is fixed in order of date of receipt of the application in the department concerned.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in which the person concerned is employed, has sympathy for the applicant but operates a system whereby officers are required to serve for a period, at present two years, before a transfer application may be considered. In this case, the officer was recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on 27 September 1999 and specifically assigned to the Revenue offices in Waterford. When the required minimum period has been completed, and should the applicant's placing on a transfer list be reached, the officer may then be considered for transfer.</P>

      <P>This levy is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premia, the exceptions being reinsurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.

      <P>The Finance Act, 1995, introduced tax relief in respect of the donation of important heritage items to the Irish national collections provided certain conditions are met. It is also necessary that the donor should not receive any consideration, other than the tax relief, as a result of the donation of the item. The relief consists of a non-refundable payment on account of tax of an amount equal to the <Col N="431" /> value of the heritage item donated, which can be offset against the donor's liability to certain taxes. The heritage item must be valued at more than £75,000 and the aggregate of items approved for donation in any one year is limited to £3,000,000.</P>
      <P>The heritage item for donation must be approved by a selection committee which is made up of the chairperson of the Heritage Council, the Director of the National Gallery of Ireland, the Director of the Arts Council, the Director of the National Library of Ireland, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland and the Director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for determining the market value of the item and I am informed that, in the absence of a specific statutory provision, they are precluded under confidentiality obligations from naming the beneficiaries of this relief. However, a list of heritage items donated under section 1003, including descriptions and values, are published in Revenue's annual report, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>There are Department of Finance guidelines, issued to State bodies, which cover, <i>inter alia</i>, the disclosure of interests by board members. It is a matter primarily for the individuals concerned to ensure that all of their activities are governed by the ethical considerations implicit in the procedures set out in these guidelines. Finally, I should mention that the procedures are currently under review and a revised version of the guidelines, which will be mandatory, will issue shortly.</P>

    <P>The Government is committed to the use of renewable energy resources and encourages alternative energy sources through, for example, incentives and price support measures. Renewable energy, of course, already forms a significant proportion of the electricity supply purchased from the ESB. The Government will continue to <Col N="432" /> be proactive in providing a leadership role in the use of renewable energy resources.</P>
    <P>The deregulation of the utility markets will present opportunities to the Government to use its position as a major property occupier to ensure that energy conservation and competitive pricing will be central features of energy management and procurement policies. Significant advances have already been made in relation to the deregulation of the electricity market. The Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance are currently examining the opportunities already available, or in train, to allow for the competitive procurement of electricity supplies.</P>

      <P>In February 2000 both I and officials of my Department met Ordnance Survey Ireland staff representatives to announce details of the Government decision of 25 January 2000 to draft a Bill providing for the setting up of Ordnance Survey Ireland as a State body. Another meeting was held between officials of my Department and Ordnance Survey staff representatives on 23 March 2001. Following the first meeting with the staff representatives important technical difficulties arose in the context of the drafting of the Bill which took a long time and a good deal of effort to resolve. Because there were no substantial developments to report to staff representatives during this period no meeting with them was arranged. The more recent meeting was held when these issues were settled.</P>
      <P>During the intervening period information on the status of the Bill was regularly conveyed to staff representatives at local level within OSI. It is also the position that since the publication of the Bill the management of OSI have made arrangements through local departmental council and a series of information seminars to inform all staff on the content of the proposed legislation as well as to discuss issues arising from it.</P>
      <P>Several issues relating to the implications of the Bill for staff of OSI were raised by their representatives and responded to by my officials and OSI management at the meeting on 23 March 2001. A formal response to these issues will be given by me shortly. I envisage that another meeting will be arranged between staff representatives and officials of my Department in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The surveillance of food for chemical residues is essential for the protection of public health. As part of their national responsibilities the Food Safety Authority of Ireland monitors the safety of food in the Irish food chain in conjunction with 41 official agencies and their associated laboratories. Through this network of co-operation it is ensured that all food consumed, distributed, marketed or produced in the state meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The national testing programme for antibiotic residues in foods of animal origin is carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development under an EU approved annual plan. Under this plan departmental veterinary staff based in export approved slaughtering plants implement the relevant controls by performing inspections and taking samples in such plants. Controls at farm level are implemented by Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development staff, who are based in its district veterinary offices distributed throughout the entire country, usually on a county, local government administrative unit, basis.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development also has a centrally based specialist unit which conducts focused investigations. These investigations are conducted in co-operation, as appropriate, with district veterinary offices, the Garda, customs services and, or staff in the slaughtering plants. Meat products are analysed at the Central Meat Control Laboratory, Abbotstown, Dublin; milk and milk products are examined by the three dairy science laboratories located in Dublin, Limerick and Cork. A large number of samples are analysed by the food industry as part of their &ldquo;own checks&rdquo; food safety assurance programmes and these results are fed into the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development national programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The own checks programme began in 2000 and is a regime based on legislation under which the meat processors are individually obliged to implement approved residue monitoring measures in respect of animals supplied to them. It involves the submission by each processor of an annual residue monitoring plan to the Depart<Col N="436" /> ment of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. In cases where animals test positive each processor must apply significantly increased levels of testing to subsequent consignments of animals from the supplier or suppliers in question. This initiative is significantly adding to the protection from illegal residues afforded to consumers of Irish food products. The initiative enables each processor, and indeed supplier, to deal effectively and in a timely manner with any problems which might emerge from time to time. It also equips Irish processors with another valuable and credible means of assuring consumers in an increasingly competitive market place of the quality and safety of their products.</P>
    <P>The Department of Marine and Natural Resources feeds into the national plan in relation to testing farmed fish for antibiotic residues and local authorities perform the same function in relation to meat slaughtered at domestic abattoirs. A small number of food samples are taken by the environmental health officer service of the health boards for residue testing as part of their national food surveillance programme of foods in the retail market. These samples are analysed in the public analysts laboratories located in Cork, Galway and Dublin. There are four national reference laboratories for residue analysis which are the Central Meat Control Laboratory, the State Laboratory, the National Food Centre and the Marine Institute Fisheries Research Laboratory. In total there are eight approved laboratories under the national residues monitoring plan. Under the national testing programme approximately 90,000 samples were taken during 1999 and were tested by approved laboratories for 18 separate groups of residues. Results show a declining trend of positive tests for illegal residues. In 1999 0.3% tested positive as compared to 0.6% in 1998, the first year of the programme. Statistics for sampling and analysis for 2000 are currently being collated.</P>
    <P>In the context of a strategy to address the antibiotic residue problem, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, working in conjunction with the FSAI, commenced a special monitoring exercise in the poultry sector during 1999-2000. This exercise involves checking additional poultry samples for the presence of inhibitory substances. In 2000 the Department worked closely with the FSAI and University College Dublin in the development of a strategy to address the problem of antibiotic resistance in poultry. A monitoring exercise was commenced by these three organisations to collate baseline data for resistance patterns in a number of species of bacteria. This work is ongoing. While testing for antibiotic residues is carried on in a number of specialised laboratories and by a number of State agencies, the overall picture of the national antibiotic residue monitoring programme in Ireland is a well structured and well implemented programme that is nationally co-ordinated by the FSAI.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. However, I am aware that, while there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for both pre-school and children of school going age with intellectual disability, autism, physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statutory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to take a flexible approach in using the resources which have been allocated to the services, including the possibility of the purchase of additional sessions, with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services.</P>
      <P>I have just received the report that I commissioned on workforce planning for speech and language therapy from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. I am currently considering its implications and will shortly be in a position to announce developments in this area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also probably aware, section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001 amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of psychological assessments and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the possibility of extending the present co-operation adoption with the Romanian authorities. Ireland initially signed a co-oper<Col N="438" /> ation adoption agreement with Romania in 1994 and most recently following the enactment of new adoption laws in Romania in February 1998. Under the agreement only foundations licensed by the Romanian committee for adoptions can engage in inter-country adoption and Irish persons wishing to adopt children in Romania must engage a Romanian foundation. There are no current plans to extend the adoption agreement between Ireland and Romania.</P>
      <P>The Romanian Ambassador recently informed me that a major review of adoption is currently taking place in Romania and that adoption legislation is being amended. I understand from the Irish Adoption Board that it has been the practice for the Romanian authorities to put adoption applications on hold when such legislation is being amended. The Irish Adoption Board is in contact with the Romanian authorities to request their assistance in progressing adoptions for Irish applicants and will monitor developments on progress. The Deputy can appreciate that the amendment of Romanian legislation is a matter for Romania and that we cannot interfere in this process.</P>
      <P>There is no State to State written agreement between Ireland and the People's Republic of China. There is however an agreed procedure between the Irish Adoption Board and China under which the board transmits adoption applications on behalf of Irish residents to the Centre of Adoption Affairs in Beijing. The centre only accepts adoption applications sent and inquiries made by the board. There are no current proposals to bring in measures to subsidise the costs associated with inter-country adoptions. The Department of Health and Children is currently drafting the heads of a new Bill on adoption to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children And Co-operation On Inter-country Adoption. It is intended that safe guards will be put in place to protect the welfare of the child and only permit the adoption of children from countries who have ratified the convention or from countries we have bilateral arrangements which meet the spirit of the convention.</P>
      <P>Issues such as costs of adoption will be regulated and it would be more appropriate to consider the issue of subsidising costs following the introduction of the legislation on the Hague Convention. I hope to present the heads to Government by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Moffatt, chairs the National AIDS Strategy Committee and is responsible for policy in this area. <i> AIDS Strategy 2000 </i>was published in June of last year and makes recommendations for dealing with HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections over the coming years. Deputy Moffatt and my Department, through the three sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care, and management will work to implement these recommendations. One of these recommendations is that research be carried out on the knowledge, attitudes and skills of young people in relation to sexual health and diseases. The Education and Prevention Sub-Committee will examine this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1992 additional funding has been provided each year to health boards to address the problems of drug misuse and HIV and AIDS. HIV is strongly linked to intravenous drug misuse. To respond to this health board services include methadone treatment and needle exchange in the range of services for drug misusers. These services have seen significant expansion in recent years, particularly in the health boards in the east where the majority of drug users reside. Health boards have developed a range of interventions among the gay community aimed at lowering the incidence in homosexuals <Col N="440" /> of HIV, including supporting a gay HIV prevention strategies project. With increasing numbers of people presenting with a range of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, a priority for 2001 is the appointment of two new infectious diseases consultants in the Dublin area and one in the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>My Department also continues to produce a range of materials and literature and to run awareness campaigns to inform the public, especially young people, about the dangers of HIV and AIDS. Specific messages have been placed in third level colleges and some night clubs and pool halls. My Department is also a partner with the Department of Education and Science in the implementation of social, personal and health education at post primary school level and the relationship and sexuality education programme is an integral component of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the provision of orthodontic services. They are being addressed and progress is being made on a number of fronts in order to increase the numbers in treatment. Following recommendations in the Moran report, <i>Review of Orthodontic Services</i>, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. An accord has been reached by the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork, and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish Specialist Dental Training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College, and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics. The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under <Col N="443" /> the auspices of the health services employers agency.</P>
    <P>I am confident the setting up of a specialist register and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health board service will result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics and this grade will act as a support to the consultant orthodontists, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling greater case loads to be achieved. It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels and, consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed a second consultant orthodontist. The appointment of a third is expected in the near future and the recruitment of a fourth is under way. A new orthodontic unit at Loughlinstown is currently being equipped. An additional five surgery unit at St. James's Hospital is also being equipped. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the Southern Health Board is developing new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and is in the process of recruiting two additional consultant orthodontists. Based on the health boards own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even if a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs justify it. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of eligible children up to the age of 16 years who are so severely disabled or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. It is open to those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for those in their care without hardship. The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. In addition, the whole area of eligibility is currently under consideration in the context of the new national health strategy.</P>

      <P>The development of services at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is a matter for consideration by the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, my colleague, Deputy Hanafin, announced approval of a grant of £5 million for the upgrading of facilities at St. Columcille's Hospital. This will include an extension to the existing accident and emergency department and a new day procedures unit. I have been informed by the ERHA that a project team is in place to oversee this work and that detailed briefs are being completed. This investment will contribute significantly to the enhancement of accident and emergency and day surgery services at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am further advised by the ERHA that discussions are taking place on the detailed configuration of a new consultant paediatric service for the east coast area in line with the provisions for the development of this service in the East Coast Area Health Board's provider plan for 2001. Consultations with GPs and users are taking place and it is envisaged that these will be completed very shortly.</P>

      <P>The board has also in recent years significantly upgraded x-ray facilities at the Sheil Hospital in Ballyshannon, 13 miles from Donegal town.

      <P>My Department continues to give HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections priority. The National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC, which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt chairs, now includes sexually transmitted infections in its brief. NASC published a strategy document last year and will work, through its subcommittees, towards the implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in a significant number of initiatives to raise awareness of sexually transmitted diseases specifically targeting young people. These include co-ordination of the education and prevention sub-committee of the National Aids Strategy Committee. This group will oversee the implementation of the recommendations made in the Report of the National Aids Strategy Committee 2000. The national youth health programme, a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland, provides ongoing training and support to youth workers through the knowledge is power HIV/AIDS education pack.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit is also partners with the Department of Education and Science in the implementation of social, personal and health education, SPHE, at post-primary school level. The relationship and sexuality education programme which addresses the above issues is an integral component of SPHE. For the past number of years the health promotion unit has also been running an advertising campaign in pubs and clubs and other youth facilities with messages concerning safer sexual health practices. My Department is also currently implementing an awareness raising campaign addressing the issues of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.</P>
      <P>On an ongoing basis, my Department is working with other specific voluntary and community organisations addressing these issues. Examples include the Gay/HIV Strategies Group and Gay Community News. A number of the regional health boards are also developing sexual health strategies and programmes of action, often in conjunction with voluntary groups, to address these issues.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The December 2000 figure of 29,290 whole-time equivalent nursing staff represents 33,597 individuals due to the very significant numbers who have opted to work in job-sharing or part-time arrangements. In addition, significant resources have been invested to facilitate general practitioners in employing practice nurses in their surgeries. There are now some 600 nurses working in this area of the health service.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy. The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,315. When account is taken of the service of agency nurses, 423 per day, and overtime working, equivalent to 592 nurses per day, the net vacancy situation pertaining at 31 January 2001 stands at 300. The gross number of vacancies reported for the Eastern Regional Health Authority region, excluding the learning disability sector, was 1,148.79.</P>
    <P>The survey shows that a total of 4,226 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 January 2001 and that a total of 2,954 resigned/retired in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,272 nurses in the system. The number of nursing vacancies existing nationally on 30 September 2000 had fallen by 5% by 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 1,224 working visas/work authorisations were issued to nurses from non-EU countries between June 2000 and April 2001. A number of hospitals in the Dublin area are reporting significant improvements in their position. For example, Beaumont Hospital, which at one stage last year was short 130 nurses, now has a full complement of nursing staff. The Mater Hospital is on target to reduce its vacancies to a low single figure by the end of next month.</P>
    <P>In response to the current shortage of nurses, I increased the number of training places last year by 300 from 1,200 to 1,500. This year a further 40 additional places have been created. It is intended to maintain the annual intakes of nursing students <Col N="455" /> at this level in order to ensure an adequate supply of nurses for our health service into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board that at 31 March 2001, there were 813 persons awaiting orthodontic treatment, one category A and 812 category B. There is no assessment waiting list in the NEHB.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the dental health action plan to be achieved. These structural changes include the creation of a new grade of specialist orthodontist and auxiliary dental worker in orthodontics.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Additional funds of £440,000 were provided to the NEHB for orthodontic services in 2001, of which £90,000 was for the orthodontic initiative. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the NEHB that this initiative will enable the treatment of an additional 250 patients to commence. In addition, I have funded the development of a new regional orthodontic unit in Dundalk and the chief executive officer of the NEHB has advised me that this will be operational in the near future. I am confident that the structural changes in the orthodontic services coupled with the orthodontic initiative will secure the delivery of an effective orthodontic service.</P>

    <P>The all-party committee's proposals in relation to crisis pregnancies are also being examined. While in principle the Government is committed to an approach along the lines set out in the report, considerable preparatory work will need to be undertaken before a plan such as that proposed can be put in place. Work is under way in my Department on appropriate arrangements for the establishment of an agency such as that proposed by the all-party committee.

    <P>A considerable amount of research internationally has been conducted into bowel cancer and its prevention. Much of this has been focused on diet. Current data suggest that a western style diet, which is high in fat and low in fibre, may increase the risk of bowel cancer. The incidence of the disease is higher in countries where this style of diet is characteristic. However, cancer is a multifactoral disease and other factors such as family history have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of risk factors associ<Col N="461" /> ated with many cancers. These include national mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives including the annual Europe against Cancer campaign.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and although a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In the budget 2001 package this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for medical cards to all persons aged 70 and over, regardless of means or hardship, with effect on 1 July 2001. The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. In addition, the whole area of eligibility is currently under consideration in the context of the new national health strategy.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to provide funding of £32 million on foot of phase 1 of the national review of bed capacity to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period. The investment package was targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and 15 consultant anaesthetists.</P>
      <P>It typically takes over 12 months to complete recruitment of a consultant on a permanent basis. In the circumstances and with a view to increasing, as soon as possible, the number of consultants working in accident and emergency departments and in anaesthetics, it was agreed with Comhairle na nOspidéal that the additional appointments in these key areas would initially be made on a temporary basis. My Department has been advised by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority that to date, 19 accident and emergency consultants and 12 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed, have been offered, or are being offered temporary contracts on foot of the decision to recruit additional consultants. It is evident from the above that the initiative has reduced the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of additional consultants. I look forward to continuing progress in these areas over the coming months.</P>

A major study of the hours worked by non-con<Col N="465" /> sultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, was carried out in association with the Irish Medical Organisation. The report recommends major changes to the hours worked by NCHDs further to the implementation of the EU Directive on Working Hours. The immediate task is to reduce the average hours worked by NCHDs at present from 75 to 58 per week in the next three and a half years &ndash; an average reduction of 17 hours per week per NCHD or 23%. The report also recommends changes to existing work practices.</P>

In order to assess the implications of the recommendations of the report of the forum, it will be necessary to quantify the effect the changes are likely to have on the improvement of services, to examine the workforce changes needed and to assess the costs involved in a representative number of hospitals.</P>

      <P>Bray was not designated under the cur<Col N="466" /> rent urban renewal scheme. In relation to the 1999 scheme, the expert panel, which assessed all the integrated area plans submitted, decided that the designation of three towns in County Wicklow, as proposed by Wicklow County Council, was disproportionate in terms of the county's population. Of the three IAPs proposed, the expert panel considered that Arklow and Wicklow warranted designation more than Bray.</P>
      <P>However, areas within Bray received tax designations on two previous occasions. On the first occasion, the 1986 urban renewal scheme was extended to Bray on the 1 May 1990. The qualifying period for that scheme in Bray was from 1 May 1990 to 31 May 1993. The end date for the scheme was subsequently extended on three occasions to 31 May 1994, 31 July 1994 and 31 December 1994. Bray was designated again under the 1994 urban renewal scheme. The initial qualifying period for that scheme was from 1 August 1994 to 31 July 1997 and this was extended on three occasions from 1 August 1997 to 31 July 1998, from the 1 August 1998 to 31 December 1998 and from 1 January 1999 to 30 April 1999, residential only.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 298 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General responsibility for policy in relation to telecommunications is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise. My remit relates to the land use planning aspects of telecommunications infrastructure. In this regard, my Department published guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures in July 1996. The guidelines were issued to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and <Col N="468" /> support structures within the planning system. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the erection of a communications mast or the attachment of antennae is development and requires planning permission. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, S.I. No. 78 of 1997, provide that the attachment to an existing radio mast of antennae for mobile telephony and the replacement of an existing mast are exempted development. The addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast are, subject to certain criteria &ndash; restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antennae and compliance with certain emissions standards &ndash; exempted development. The purpose of the 1997 regulations was to clarify the position in relation to the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to existing radio masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators in order to reduce the number of masts required and minimise the impact of masts on the environment and landscape.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can, by way of regulations, provide that the Planning and Development Acts would not apply to development by or on behalf of a State authority, where such development was in connection with or for the purposes of public safety or order, or the administration of justice or national security or defence. Effect was given to this provision by way of Part XIII of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, which provided for an alternative public consultation process. As a result, for example, Garda communications masts used for the purpose of or in connection with the operations of the Garda Síochána do not need planning permission and instead are subject to Part XIII of the 1994 regulations.</P>
    <P>On the question of temporary masts and antennae, Class 29 of Part I of the Second Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, exempts certain development by licensed telecommunications operators from the requirement for planning permission. In particular, Class 29(h) exempts transportable radio links subject to a number of conditions, one of which is that the link shall be removed from the land on which it is provided not later than 12 months from the date on which it was provided. A comprehensive review of the exempted development regulations made under the Planning Acts is currently under way in my Department. Work on these regulations, which requires the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they can be made, is now at an advanced stage and I propose to publish these <Col N="469" /> regulations and submit them to the Oireachtas within the next month.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the remedial works scheme, works to purchased dwellings, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the owner, may be included in a project where the local authority considers such works necessary to avoid an unacceptable or incongruous result to the refurbishment of the estate as a whole. In such cases, my Department will fund 50% of the cost of eligible works to the dwellings. The funding of the balance is a matter for arrangement between the tenant purchaser and the local authority. It would be normal practice for a local authority to enter into an agreement with a tenant purchaser to meet the balance by way of lump sum payment, increased or extended annuity payments, home improvement loan or combination of such methods of payment.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, contains significant new provisions to improve the enforcement of the planning code and to prevent the abuse of the retention permission system. In particular, an application for retention permission will no longer be a defence to a prosecution under the Act and cannot be used to stay court proceedings. <Col N="471" /> In addition, fees for retention permission can be set at a significantly higher level than is the case at present.</P>
      <P>The commencement orders for the development control and enforcement provisions of the Act will be made in tandem with the necessary regulations, some of which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of major road project planning, local authorities initiate, at an early stage, a process of public consultation in connection with route selection. Typically the initial public consultation takes the form of an information brochure or similar material addressed to local communities and business <Col N="473" /><Col N="474" /> interests outlining the need for the project, a general description of broad-band corridor route options and a questionnaire seeking the views and concerns of the public. In addition, public presentations are arranged by the local authority at a number of venues in the area concerned to outline the proposal and address requests for information or clarification.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the public response, together with the findings of studies conducted to identify route constraints, the local authority identifies a preferred route, which is also the subject of public consultation. The primary purpose of the consultation exercise is to bring the public up to date on developments in the planning of the project taking account of public feedback and the findings of constraint studies and, in particular, to outline information on the preferred route option.</P>
      <P>The above consultations are pre-statutory and it is not considered appropriate for them to be subjected to detailed regulation.

      <P>Non-national road grant allocations for 2001 have been fully made to all local authorities. It is now a matter for Roscommon County Council to prioritise particular county roads for improvement or maintenance under their 2001 allocation of £9.204 million; the latter allocation represents an increase of 13% on the corresponding allocation of £8.177 million and a 59% increase on the council's 1997 grant of £5.759 million.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this level of funding, supplemented by Roscommon County Council's resources, is appropriate to its ongoing non-national roads requirements.</P>

      <P>The scheme was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Cork County Council, for its southern division, in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced last July. Given the level of competing demand, the limited funding available and the fact that Cork County Council has not prioritised its list on a countywide basis, it was not possible to include the scheme in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>Last year I extended the terms of the task force on special housing aid for the elderly scheme to include, where appropriate, the provision of heating systems. Under the task force, which is operated by the health boards, necessary basic repairs and improvements are carried out to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, it has, since its inception, been administered with a minimum of formality and it has been an objective to avoid formal procedural and other requirements. Works are, in appropriate circumstances, carried out at no cost to the applicant.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are a number of options currently available to assist lower income households and elderly persons, in particular, to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming to office I have introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled person's grant scheme has increased from £8,000 to £16,000 with the grant covering up to 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. In addition, I have increased the maximum grant available under the essential <Col N="476" /> repairs grant from £1,800 to £7,500. I also allocated record funding of £8.658 million to the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly in 2001. These improvements have allowed local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, particularly in regard to the provision of heating systems.</P>
    <P>In the case of a local authority house the management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in dwellings may form part of the works undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A variety of measures have been taken to date to address the difficulties currently being experienced by local authorities with regard to the recruitment of planners. The main problem is the shortage of qualified planners available for employment by the local authorities. This problem is being addressed. I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September 2000 new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum.</P>
      <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued. In this regard, my Department, along with a number of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, has participated in the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign and other recruitment initiatives over the past few months to source professional planners on a contract basis. As a result of this, 27 qualified planners have been placed on a panel from which planning positions in the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála can be filled on a contract basis. The Local Government Management Services Board is now managing this process and extending it to target other construction professionals such as engineers, architects and quantity surveyors.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, have no plans at present to introduce a trainee scheme for planners in local authorities. Newly graduated planners without any experience are eligible for assistant planner positions in the local authorities. This grade is also open to individuals without a qualification in town planning recognised by the Local Appointments Commissioners but who have a relevant qualification, for example, in architecture, engineering, chartered surveying, environmental economics, and who have at least two years' relevant experience.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these have been a feature of this scheme since its inception. They apply at peak times on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not apply in the case of men<Col N="483" /> tally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on the DART, suburban rail services and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April last year. The review notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. It recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children bringing this recommendation to its attention.</P>
    <P>Also in this regard, under the provisions of the health Acts, a health board may make arrangements for the conveyance of patients to and from hospitals for people requiring medical treatment.</P>
    <P>In general free travel pass holders make suitable arrangements around the peak time restrictions. Where there are exceptional extenuating circumstances where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass. Such passes are issued on a once-off basis only and are valid for up to six months. Requests for such passes are considered on a case by case basis. To date this has occurred in a very small number of exceptional cases. Any general lifting of the time restrictions would cause capacity problems for CIE and further disruption to work and school commuters.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by this Department, is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.</P>

      <P>Provision is made for migrant workers under EU Regulation 1408/71 which applies on a reciprocal basis to all EU member states. These provide for short-term benefits which would include the relevant benefit in this case if the person had returned from an EU country and long-term benefits such as the contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>Ireland also has concluded bilateral agreements with a number of countries, mainly those which have a tradition of emigration from Ireland. These are Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Quebec, Switzerland and the USA. These reciprocal agreements apply only to long-term benefits and would not have provided benefit in this case if the person had come from one of these countries.</P>
      <P>In the normal course people who return to Ireland usually have sufficient income to maintain themselves until they take up employment and become subject to Irish legislation. If they fail to obtain employment in the short term, they are eligible for the full range of social assistance payments in the same way as Irish residents who do not have social insurance cover or who have exhausted their entitlement to social insurance benefits.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, one of the persons claimed and received unemployment assistance intermittently between July last year and April this year, including full increases for her husband and children. It is believed that she was employed between the periods claimed.</P>
      <P>The other person never worked in Ireland and has no PRSI contributions under Irish legislation. He is in the same position as any other person resident in Ireland without an Irish insurance record. He would be entitled to unemployment assistance if he fulfilled the conditions and satisfied the means test. Alternatively, he would be entitled to a disability allowance if he satisfied the medical and means conditions.</P>
      <P>Returned emigrants are treated in the same way as other residents of the State who are in similar need of income support and I have no plans to amend the social welfare legislation.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September, during which time approved students will be allowed to undertake 200 hours <Col N="485" /> work in community based projects at £3 per hour, giving a possible total maximum payment of £600.</P>
      <P>The scheme is targeted at students from low income families who are participating in third level courses and who, under existing legislation, cannot apply for unemployment assistance during the summer months.</P>
      <P>This year, to give extra help to less well off students, I have decided that an additional £1 per hour will be paid to students whose parents are solely dependent on social welfare payments. This will allow them to earn an extra £200 if they work the maximum number of hours allowed under the scheme giving them a total maximum tax free payment of £800.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in recognition of the special difficulties such students may experience when looking for summer work, I have decided that approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind persons pension will be eligible to participate in the scheme this year.</P>
      <P>It would be inadvisable to increase the overall payment or to do this in a tightening labour market situation given the demand for student participation in the mainstream job market during the busy summer period, particularly in the hotel and tourism industries. The scheme does not fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation and, therefore, the minimum wage provisions do not apply.</P>

      <P>The live register is published each month by the Central Statistics Office. It is an administrative count of persons in receipt of or claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or credited contributions in respect of unemployment.</P>
      <P>To gain access to the live register a person must be unemployed and satisfy the conditions for receipt of benefit or of credits. Women have equality of access with men to unemployment payments and credited contributions and are included on the live register if they are unemployed and satisfy the conditions. At the end of April 2001, there were 135,561 persons on the live register of whom 56,417 &ndash; or 41% &ndash; were women.</P>
      <P>The live register is used as a gateway to many educational, training and employment programmes administered by my Department and other agencies such as FÁS. There is done to target access to these programmes to the most disadvantaged as some of the programmes have limitations on the number of places available. This requirement has however proved to be a barrier to a significant number of women who are not on the live register and who should be equally targeted for access to such programmes. The question of widening access to employment, training and educational programmes to persons not on the live register was examined by a working group on women's access to labour market opportunities which reported in 2000. Implementations of the recommendations in that report is being processed by the Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their mortgage because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>The scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The principal is not, and never was, taken into account in the calculation of the mortgage interest supplement because it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board has been contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that she was given an application form to complete in respect of a claim for mortgage interest supplement. To date she has not returned the completed application form to the local community welfare officer and accordingly her claim cannot be processed. On receipt of the completed form the CWO will be in a position to make a decision on the person's entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in recognition of the growing importance of the creative audio-visual production sector for our cultural expression and economic prosperity, I established the Film Industry Strategic Review Group in 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Ossie Kilkenny to review progress in the sector and make recommendations for its further development as we face into the early years of this new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group submitted its report in August 1999, the conclusions of which I agreed in principle, with the exception of the imposition of a levy on cinema ticket sales. The key recommendations to which the Government agreed and for which I have statutory responsi<Col N="489" /> bility related to the need for a strengthened, broadened and restructured Irish Film Board to address the cultural and new strategic goals of the industry and to underpin the successful implementation of the majority of the report's recommendations; and the provision of enhanced funding for the board.</P>
    <P>Arising from these strong conclusions I reviewed the resources of personnel, current funding and organisation required by the Irish Film Board for its expanded role and, having made a case to the Minister for Finance, was able to secure an increase in staff numbers to almost double the current staffing level of the board, as well as agreeing on its revised staffing structure with the necessary financial support to realise these improvements; and increased allocations in the board's capital funds for development and production loans to the extent that its 2001 provision will represent a 100% increase on its 1997 allocation.</P>
    <P>In addition, following consideration of the strong case put forward by me on the basis of the review group's report, the Minister for Finance in budget 2000 agreed to an unprecedented extension of the current section 481 tax relief scheme until April 2005 and increased the limits on the amounts production companies can raise under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The balance of the recommendations of the report agreed by Government fall directly within the remit of the Irish Film Board and other agencies.</P>

For upland commonage in the six western counties to which the interim 30% destocking was applied, work is 90% complete. Completion of the plans has been delayed over the past few months, due mainly to the foot and mouth disease restrictions.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the monastery was extensively damaged due to a fire on the night of 19-20 May.

    <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical <Col N="493" /> interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area.</P>
    <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage. I am advised that the St. Alphonsus Monastery is included in Dublin Corporation's record of protected structures.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded under the Planning Acts covers both the interior and exterior of the monastery and in the absence of a declaration from Dublin Corporation, outlining any works which are exempted development, any future building works will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observations.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is not holding up the work at Bond Bridge. In my earlier reply of 14 November 2000 I indicated that, in response to concerns expressed by my Department regarding the protection of the architecturally significant bridges, Kildare County Council employed the services of a conservation architect to examine the merits or otherwise of the proposal for conserving the existing structure.</P>
      <P>Having considered the contents of that report my Department wrote to the council on 12 March 2001 to indicate that one of the options outlined by the conservation architect, although a compromise, would be acceptable. This proposal would retain part of the fabric of this historic bridge on the site where it was built. The stone from the part of the bridge to be demolished could be used to face the western side of the new bridge. A response in the matter is awaited from Kildare County Council.</P>
      <P>The question of cost is a matter for Kildare County Council.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have discretionary funding available to allocate to floodlighting projects other than at properties in its care.</P>
      <P>The main source of public funds for heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995. Under this Act the council has the powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection preservation and promotion of built heritage. The council is located in Rothe House, Kilkenny City, telephone (056) 70777, Fax number (056) 70788. While I as Minister provide operational funding to the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by the council on the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition the local authorities administer a grant aid scheme for approved conservation works to buildings-monuments listed on the local authority record of protected structures.</P>

For this year alone over 480 excavation licences have been issued. Most excavations arise from development projects so the opportunities for the public to access and view them are very limited.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, provides visitor services at over 70 sites, many of which deal with archaeological and historical themes.</P>

    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that Garda records do not differentiate between speeding and other fines. The Deputy may wish to know that the number of speeding tickets issued by the Garda for the years 1998-2000 was 143,019 in respect of 1998, 177,249 for 1999 and 224,264 in respect of the year 2000. Experience to date has shown that over 80% of fines on the spot for speeding are paid without recourse to legal proceedings. The fine on the spot for speeding is £50.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, the Refugee Applications Commissioner &ndash; RAC &ndash; is required to give an applicant for asylum a temporary residence certificate &ndash; TRC. This certificate which is not an identity card is a very important and valuable document and is the property of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Persons who lose their TRC are obliged to report the loss to the Garda which, in turn, notifies the loss to the RAC which will normally issue a replacement. The person named should, if he has not already done so, immediately notify the Garda of the loss of the TRC to enable procedures for the issue of a replacement to commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 to 356, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no precedent for the disclosure of a Garda report in the manner suggested. However, the assistant commissioner who carried out the investigation and complied the report is willing to meet the family members of the victims to discuss the contents of his report with them. Arrangements for such a meeting may be made through the Garda Commissioner's office.</P>
      <P>With regard to the person referred to in the Deputy's second question, I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 26 July 1997 the person in question, now deceased, was arrested and detained at the Bridewell Garda station under the provisions of section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. I am further informed that his arrest and detention related to a double murder at Grangegorman, Dublin 7, on 6-7 March 1997. The facts of the case as outlined to me by the Garda Síochána are that, soon after his arrest and detention, the person in question made a full admission to investigating officers of his alleged involvement in the double murder. This admission was recorded on audio-video tape, as provided for under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987.</P>
      <P>Later on that same date, the person in question made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This interview was not audio-visually recorded, at the person's request. I understand that his request for the discontinuance of the electronic recording of the interview was also captured on tape. I am informed that the manner in which the person in question was interviewed was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997, which came into operation on 1 March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultation between the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Public <Col N="505" /> Prosecutions, the person in question was charged with the murder of Ms Mary Callinan and appeared before a special sitting of the Dublin District Court and was remanded in custody. Subsequently, as a result of matters emanating from another quarter, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to conduct an investigation-probative inquiry in order to establish the veracity of the statements of admission.</P>
    <P>I understand that a thorough investigation was carried out and that a comprehensive file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director, having considered the file, directed that criminal proceedings against the person in question be discontinued. Proceedings were terminated in the Dublin District Court on 29 April 1998 and the person was subsequently released from custody.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 16 August 1997 another person was arrested in Galway in connection with a serious crime in County Roscommon. While in custody in Mill Street Garda station, Galway, he made a number of inculpatory statements in relation to his alleged involvement in the murder of the two women to which the Deputy refers, though I understand that he later retracted his statements of admission. The Garda Commissioner then directed that an investigation into this man's alleged involvement in the murders be carried out by an assistant commissioner.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the investigation which followed was a thorough one and that a complete file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration. The director decided that no prosecution should take place. I should point out that the director is independent in the discharge of his functions and that I have no role in the prosecution of offences. As the Deputy will appreciate, the director is precluded from giving reasons for his decisions in any case other than to the investigating members of An Garda Síochána, and I cannot intervene in or comment on his decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest that the increase in licensed premises or the extended opening hours of licensed premises has led to an increase in vandalism or anti-social <Col N="506" /> behaviour in the Camden Street area. The Garda authorities consider that this area is no different from any other street in the city in so far as public order issues are concerned and they are satisfied that they have sufficient resources available to them to deal with the matter. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that operational needs will dictate the level of service provided at any given time, and fluctuations in this regard may occur.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the policing of Camden Street is undertaken jointly by Harcourt Terrace and Kevin Street Garda stations. It is constantly patrolled by uniformed members of the Garda Síochána and by members of the detective units, as well as by specialist units such as the divisional crime task force, drug units, special resource units and community policing units.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Camden Street and surrounding areas receive special attention under Operation Oíche, which focuses on high-visibility policing with the specific aim of addressing public order issues, particularly when pubs and night clubs close. I am also informed that the policing of the Camden Street and surrounding areas is a top priority for both the superintendents at Kevin Street and Pearse Street Garda stations and that this will continue. The Heytesbury Street area, which runs parallel to Camden Street, is another location that receives constant attention by Kevin Street Garda station, and this will also continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of closed circuit television &ndash; CCTV &ndash; the Deputy will be aware that last November I announced that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years. Although the Camden Street area was not among the ten locations prioritised for the provision of such facilities in the period 2001-02, the matter is being kept under review in the context of a further tranche of CCTV expansion that will be announced in due course.</P>

      <P>Since 1998, substantial progress had been made in developing and implementing the recommendations contained in the Garda SMI report. The Garda SMI review is approaching completion and it is envisaged that the Garda SMI steering group will present its final report to Government in early 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One major project under Garda SMI is the <Col N="507" /> review of Garda structures and operating systems. This commenced in December 2000 and will be completed in the autumn of 2001. This review will develop the headquarters and regional structures, review headquarters' specific and core role functions, review the roles of ranks and develop criteria in relation to stations, focusing on the best use of resources to deliver a policing service to the community. The review will not be recommending the closure of Garda stations. The final report on structures and operating systems will first be considered by the Garda SMI steering group and, ultimately, by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide direct grant-aid for tourism product development. Bord Fáilte Éireann was the implementing body for such schemes under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99, with decisions on grant approval being made by an independent product management board. A similar arrangement will be in place, for the period of the current national development plan, under which I was able to obtain a commitment of £100 million for a tourism product development.</P>
      <P>The new tourism product investment scheme will be administered via the tourism measures of the regional operational programmes. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general consensus that the focus of public investment in tourism projects must be to enhance the potential of less developed tourism areas by supporting the development of signifi<Col N="508" /> cant attractions or clusters of attractions in such areas.</P>
    <P>Hotels, of course, continue to benefit from the capital allowance scheme, under which capital expenditure on any building or structure in use as a hotel or holiday camp, registered with Bord Fáilte, may qualify for capital allowances. Beneficiaries are entitled to claim a maximum 15% capital allowance in years one to six and 10% in the final year. As recently as February last, the Irish Hotels Federation, in its Blueprint for the Future &ndash; a strategic review and recommendations for the Irish hotel and guesthouse industry, affirmed that capital allowances remain the most important form of incentive available to hotels.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contribution that small accommodation providers, including small hotels, have made to Irish tourism and I recognise the need to encourage and develop the sector. An initiative, targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider, has been launched whereby Bord Fáilte carried out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category were branded and marketed overseas with a view to increasing overall business, particularly in off-season times and in rural areas. Almost £1.4 million has been set aside for this initiative to date and it has considerably expanded the range of support offered to the sector, thereby developing the marketing capabilities of the operators themselves.</P>
    <P>Detailed guidelines for project promoters, on the new scheme for product development, have been drafted by Bord Fáilte, in consultation with my Department. Meanwhile, the scheme is still being examined under the State aids rules by DG Competition of the European Commission, to whom the scheme has been formally notified as required by the relevant regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 371 together.</P>
      <P>Following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and its adverse impact on the tourism sector, I secured an additional £5 million in Exchequer funding for a major tourism marketing reassurance programme by Bord Fáilte for the promotion of Ireland in the major overseas source markets as well as support for a campaign directed at increased domestic holiday taking by Irish people. In addition, Bord Fáilte redirected £3 million from their own resources to the programme and a further £2 million was announced by the Government at its meeting yesterday in Killarney, bringing the total budget for the campaign to £10 million as originally requested by the industry. These actions are, of course, incremental to the 2001 budget previously approved for tourism marketing which represented the largest ever level of State funding for tourism marketing and brings the total Exchequer provision now for tourism marketing and promotion in 2001 to £67 million.</P>
      <P>All tourism regions and operators, including the Irish Farmhouse Holiday Group, will benefit from the major additional tourism marketing activities being undertaken. The main objective of the campaign is to get Ireland back into the minds of prospective travellers as an attractive holiday destination through a range of marketing activities conducted, in many cases, jointly with local tour operators, carriers and other relevant trade.</P>
      <P>As regards measures to alleviate possible financial difficulties being experienced by tourism operators, the Irish Bankers Federation, in a statement on 30 March, indicated its commitment to give careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for particular support from those customers who encounter financial problems. The Department of Finance has also confirmed that, in so far as particular cash flow problems arise for individual businesses, the Revenue Commissioners will, as part of normal arrangements, look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>The third level student support schemes and the free fees initiative contain provisions relating to residency and nationality.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees criteria, tuition fees will be paid in respect of candidates who hold EU nationality or official refugee status, and who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course, subject to certain conditions. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate must fulfil conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Under the nationality requirement a candidate must hold EU nationality, official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State. To fulfil the residency requirement, a candidate's parents or guardians or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate her/himself, shall have been resident in the State from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The awarding body, a local authority or VEC, has discretion to waive this condition in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rate of tuition fees charged by the individual universities, where students are not eligible under the free fees initiative, such institutions are autonomous bodies and it is a matter for each university to define the category of students obliged to pay the non-EU rate of tuition fees.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the planning and building unit of my Department received an application from the school referred to by the Deputy for the conversion of an existing handball court to a handball court-general purpose area. The school initially had planned to convert a handball alley on the school site. However, this was deemed to be impracticable from an architectural perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time my Department suggested that the provision of an independent GP facility might be a more appropriate response to the school's accommodation needs. The criteria outlined in existing planning guidelines state that in order to qualify for an independent GP facility of 111 mf7&gt;2, <Col N="515" /> the school should retain sufficient pupil numbers to maintain a three classroom school in the long term.</P>
    <P>Following an in-depth examination of the case, which involved consultations with the local inspector, it has been concluded that the school concerned will fulfil the required criteria for a separate GP facility. My Department will be in contact with the school authorities in regard to the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at St. Joseph's national school has decreased from 234 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 218 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and eight mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. An enrolment of 240 pupils on 30 September 2000 was required for the retention of the post of the ninth mainstream class teacher. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher, a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school liaison teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases, an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the school meets <Col N="516" /> the defined criteria as outlined in circular 12/01 which issued to schools recently. Unfortunately, at this time it is not possible to sanction the retention of the ninth mainstream class teaching post at St. Joseph's for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    <P>In January, I launched the new programme entitled Giving Children An Even Break which deals with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes which are infants through to second class and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes which range from third class through to sixth class.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive a supplementary grant aid of £1,860 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year in addition to one <i>ex quota</i> teacher and £7,020 under the disadvantaged area scheme. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>

      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and, by the end of this school year, there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by schools in gaining access to psychological assessments in urgent cases, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. I recently announced funding of £1.25 million for an important new initiative aimed at addressing these difficulties. NEPS will be communicating details of the new scheme to all schools in June.</P>

      <P>My Department is participating in the Government's public private partnership &ndash; PPP &ndash; pilot programme. One of the PPP projects is a bundle of five post-primary schools located in Dunmanway, Ballincollig, Clones, Shannon and Tubbercurry. The Dunmanway project consists of the amalgamation of Maria Immaculate post-primary school and Coláiste Chairbre. The preferred bidder will design, build, finance, operate and maintain the five schools for 25 years and will receive a unitary payment from the Department for providing the service.</P>
      <P>Under the PPP process, the facilities management activities at the five schools will transfer to the operator and existing employees who perform caretaking and cleaning activities will transfer to the private sector under the Acquired Rights Directive (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 and 2000. The project agreement, detailing the operation of the project over the 25 years, which will be signed by my Department and the preferred bidder, requires the transferring employees to be employed on the same or better terms and conditions as those which currently exist.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that material relating to these PPP projects was sent to the Oireachtas Library by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is implementing two early school leaving initiatives at present. The eight to 15 early school leaver initiative was introduced on a pilot basis in September 1998 and involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. Its purpose is to develop and test models of the delivery of supports for those young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage or are outside the formal school system while still of compulsory school going age. In 2000, I extended the initiative in the existing 17 projects for the period 1 July 2000 to August 2002.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative will be expanded, by invitation, to additional schools and projects which will be chosen on the basis of need and objective criteria. Work is currently under way on the identification of the new areas and schools. I assure the Deputy that the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched, initially in 58 schools. This marked a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. In May 2000, an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
      <P>This initiative includes four schools in County Wexford. It is expected that further invitations will issue to schools to participate in the future. The selection of schools for invitation to participate has been based on overall enrolment figures and the number of pupils failing to remain in school up to the completion of the senior cycle. For some time my Department has been involved in a detailed analysis of data from individual schools which has allowed a more complete picture of early school leaving to be developed than was the case in the past. This has allowed resources under the stay in school initiative to be targeted at schools through which they should reach the greatest possible number of young people at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Presentation secondary school in Wexford town and some other schools which have not been invited to participate in the initiative have planned and, in some cases, are implementing programmes to support those of their pupils who are at risk. I appreciate that these schools are doing very valuable work to retain young people in school. The current method used to select schools for invitation into the initiative will be reviewed prior to issuing <Col N="524" /> invitations to any further schools to participate in the initiative. The selection procedure will continue to target resources to where they benefit locations with the highest concentrations of young people at risk.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made for education in STDs and AIDS at all levels within post-primary schools. In 1990, AIDS education resource materials were developed by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science and disseminated to all schools. Teacher training was offered to all schools over the period 1990-2. These materials continue to be highly valued and used as a resource in teaching about STDs and AIDS.</P>
      <P>The interim curriculum and guidelines on relationships and sexuality education, 1996, and the accompanying classroom resource materials make provision for education in STDs and AIDS. This programme has been promoted in schools since 1997 and is delivered at both junior and senior cycles levels. More recently, provision for education in STDs and AIDS has been made within the relationships and sexuality education &ndash; RSE &ndash; module of social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; which is currently being introduced on a phased basis at junior cycle level in all post-primary schools. It is intended that all schools will have a junior cycle SPHE programme in place by the end of the 2002-03 school year. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently planning for the development of an SPHE curriculum at senior cycle level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current and future developments in social, personal and health education aim to develop a model which has at its core the development of personal and social skills to enable young people <Col N="525" /> make informed choices about themselves and their lives in a moral and socially responsible way.

      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags. In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining <Col N="526" /> the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. The number of vehicles engaged to provide services under the school transport scheme is currently 3,030, of which 698 are Bus Éireann buses. The remainder are provided by private contractors engaged by Bus Éireann. These figures include vehicles retained as spares and required for replacement purposes from time to time. The question of the replacement of vehicles no longer considered suitable for school transport is a matter for Bus Éireann and the contractors.</P>
      <P>The age profile and quality of vehicles of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement. Bus Éireann is responsible for the safe condition of the vehicles in use and has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. Contractors employed by Bus Éireann must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme have to meet rigid safety standards. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment and Local Government tests in regard to roadworthiness. All school transport vehicles are also subject to regular inspection to ensure their reliability is maintained throughout the year. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <P>A three year senior cycle was introduced as an option for second level schools from September 1994. The programmes now available at senior cycle include a one year transition year programme and a two year leaving certificate programme with three orientations, the estab<Col N="527" /> lished leaving certificate, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
      <P>It is for the authorities of individual schools to decide whether to offer the transition year programme. In making this choice, a school may decide to offer the programme to all its fourth year cohort or to some of those students. Transition year programmes are offered at present in more than 500 schools to some 23,000 students. A further 15 schools have indicated their intention to introduce the programme for the first time in the next school year, 2001-2.</P>

      <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level in this country, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the post-graduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the information supplied by the <Col N="528" /> Deputy, it appears that the teacher in question qualified as a second level teacher in this country, but has obtained qualified teacher status in the United Kingdom to teach at primary level. In such circumstances, my Department would need to be provided with details of the appropriate conversion course undertaken by the teacher in the United Kingdom to ensure that the teacher is now appropriately qualified to teach in primary schools in this country. Qualified second level teachers who trained in this State and who have not undergone a postgraduate conversion course to qualify as a primary teacher are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools.</P>

The new funding arrangements relating to the purchase of sites announced by my predecessor in January 1999 were approved by the Minister for Finance subject to the condition that ownership of the property thus financed was vested in the State.</P>
      <P>The legal advice available to my Department is that there are inherent legal difficulties associated with dual ownership of different parts of a single school site. Consequently, my Department does not fund the purchase of site extensions unless the whole site is vested in the State. There has been no change in this policy since the new funding arrangements came into operation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports, to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through to second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through to sixth class.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £3,016 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools, as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>

      <P>There are nine secretarial and administrative civil servants employed in my Department's press and information office. The office does not have its own specific budget. No expenditure was incurred on public relations consultancy in 1998; £15,840 was expended in 2000 and £57,840 to date in 2001. The sums expended in 2000 and 2001 include payments to a consultancy firm which was commissioned by my Department to provide advice on a range of issues, including advice on the organisation, role and function of the press and information office and issues relating to the ASTI dispute. They also advised the interdepartmental committee which was convened at the request of the Government to consider strategy in relation to the ASTI dispute.</P>

      <P>My Department has reserved sites in the Adamstown area for a primary and a post-primary school and the question of whether to proceed with the development of these schools is under consideration at present. My Department is currently examining the proposed plan for Adamstown and a meeting has been arranged between officials of my Department, including the local school inspectors, and officials of South Dublin County Council to discuss the matter of school provision in the area. A further site for a <Col N="534" /> primary school has been reserved in the Griffeen/Foxborough area.</P>
      <P>My Department has already responded to the demand for primary and post-primary school places in Lucan by approving a number of major school extensions at both levels in the area.

However, the rate of progress to construction of a project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.

      <P>It is intended to continue to expand the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; on a phased basis until all schools are able to avail of its service. Each cohort of additional psychologists is being divided equitably among all regions according to the student numbers in each. At present, there are 82 psychologists serving with the NEPS. It is intended to appoint up to 20 more psychologists before the end of the current school year and to recruit a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. Schools in County Kildare have been identified by NEPS as a priority when further psychologists are appointed.</P>

      <P>One of the aims of the Schools IT2000 project was that all schools would have access to the Internet. A survey carried out for the Department indicates that almost 100% of schools now have access to the Internet. This represents a substantial increase from the 1998 situation when only 20% had access.</P>
      <P>In addition, following from Schools IT2000, the pupil-computer ratios are now 17.7:1 for primary and 13:1 for post-primary schools, up from 35:1 and 16:1, respectively, in 1998. Approximately 50,000 IT training places have been provided and 75% of all teachers have attended some ICT course since early 1998.Full-time ICT advisers have been appointed to each of the 20 full-time education centres around the country to provide training courses and advice and support to schools on ICT issues on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>School integration projects &ndash; SIPS &ndash; funding has been provided for 80 SIPS, involving almost 10% of schools and 58 public and private sector partners. The outcome of these SIPS will allow for the development best practice models for dissemination throughout the education system. The evaluation of this important initiative is currently under way.</P>
      <P>In first level schools, there has been a significant increase in the use of ICT in the curriculum. This is especially the case in English, other modern languages, learning support and mathematics. A number of public private partnership projects were entered into under Schools IT2000 which amounted in total value to almost £20 million. The ScoilNet website, a point of reference for ICT in education, is now positioned as the educational portal site and is under constant review in order to ensure that it remains relevant to a changing educational environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Additional funding of £81 million &ndash; £60 million in capital and £21 million in current expenditure &ndash; over the three years 2001 to 2003 has been made available. A review and evaluation of the progress made to date across all aspects of Schools IT2000 is being undertaken by my Department in 2000-1 with a view to deciding how best to allocate resources in the future. This process is now nearing completion and further grants to schools will take account of its outcome.</P>
