      <P>Before the Order of Business today, I wish to make an announcement. On 14 October 1999 and subsequent dates, I made a ruling to allow for a brief topical question from the Leaders, which in my view reflected the evolving practice, and in December last year I circulated to all Members a detailed explanatory note on the Order of Business indicating the scope of the procedure on the Leaders' questions.</P>
      <P>I was perfectly within my rights, as Ceann Comhairle, to make my ruling on the Leaders' questions facility. However, in view of the fact that this facility has been challenged on a number of occasions and was seriously challenged yesterday, and the fact that the perimeters have been pushed out daily in regard to what can be raised on Leaders' questions resulting in prolonged debate and disorder, I have come to the conclusion that this facility must be provided for by a change in Standing Orders. Accordingly, as it is important that all Members know where we stand in regard to the procedures that are in operation on the Order of Business, I intend from today to strictly maintain the position set out in Standing Order 26(3) on matters that can be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> It is a matter for the Dáil reform sub-committee in the first instance to propose amendments to Standing Orders and the matter of raising topical issues, which I have tried to deal with, can be provided for in that committee and put forward for agreement by the House as a Standing Order in its own right. This is the best and only way to proceed. In the meantime, the Leaders' questions facility will not continue except in relation to the issue of Northern Ireland. I call the Taoiseach on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, when you made that ruling, the first time such a ruling was made in my years in the House, I understood your reason for doing so because relevant topical issues which were being discussed in the media and in the newspapers could not be raised here. As Taoiseach, I abided by that ruling and I hope I have tried to use the topical questions facility to the advantage of the House as best I could, but <Col N="3" /> I understand your reasoning. The Government, through the Chief Whip, will do all it can to work with the parties on an all-party basis. I have no objection in principle to the topical questions facility. There are many other issues that I believe will improve the House and, as you suggested, we will co-operate fully in working this matter through the sub-committee on Dáil reform. I will instruct the Chief Whip today to talk to the other Whips about how to deal with that and other matters as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, while fully endorsing your right to do this, I regret you have found it necessary to put on hold your ruling, which Fine Gael warmly welcomed at the time, that the Leaders could make a statement on a topical issue. It is regrettable that you have found yourself in this position. Fine Gael has always tried to obey your ruling on this matter. I hope the Standing Order can be changed as quickly as possible. I do not know who you will be facing on this bench next week, a Cheann Comhairle, and it is unfortunate that whoever will be sitting in this seat next week will not have that facility until such time as the Standing Order is altered. This facility has been beneficial to the work and the relevancy of this House. I appreciate you are doing this because you believe it is not being abided by and because it was challenged yesterday, but I hope you will do everything in your power to change the Standing Order within the next few days and bring it before the House so that this procedure can continue.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy I will do everything possible to facilitate the necessary change but it is, in the first instance, a matter for the committee on Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the chairperson, Deputy Seamus Brennan, could take on board the wishes of everyone in this House because the Members opposite do not know when they will be on these benches &ndash; I hope it will be after the next election &ndash; and they will be glad they were speedy in amending this Standing Order. I look forward to agreeing the change to the Standing Order, perhaps tomorrow morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us elected to the House have different functions to perform and different obligations to the electorate who put its trust in us. We either have to perform the tasks of Govern<Col N="4" /> ment under the rule of law or, just as importantly, to perform the tasks of Opposition in keeping whatever Government is elected to account and holding it up to account so that the Fourth Estate, the media, can reflect back to the electorate what is happening inside the Chamber.</P>
      <P>You, Sir, are the interpreter of the rules and I recognise, without question, your authority in that respect. However, we also have to adhere to rules and one of the primary rules the leader of an Opposition party has is to maintain vigorous opposition so that democracy might function and people get the Government, of whatever complexion, to which it is entitled. Your interpretation of what you consider to be unacceptable behaviour yesterday from my party &ndash; I take it that the remarks were directed to my party &ndash; are unacceptable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply expressing the point that when I asked a question as to when the Taoiseach might reply to a letter I wrote on 4 January you, Sir, offered the view that I had asked that question the day before and, therefore, I could not ask it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In your liberal and welcome interpretation of a facility for Leaders' questions where a leader of a party can raise a topical issue, surely the question of correspondence which had been unanswered was sufficient for me to raise? There has to be a way within the rules of the House and the orderly conduct of debate for Opposition Deputies and the Leader of an Opposition party to ask a question of the Taoiseach and not have it circumscribed on the basis that it was asked the day before and cannot be asked subsequently simply because no reply was offered the day before. That in effect would give whoever was Taoiseach a veto whereby simply not answering a question on day one would mean the same question could not be answered on days two, three, four, five or six.</P>
      <P>This is not the place where rules and procedures should be debated or negotiated, but there is an absolute necessity for this and any Opposition &ndash; I am as much protecting the rights of Fianna Fáil when it is returned to Opposition after the next election&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;to have the same ability to interrogate whatever Government is in office as we must have. Otherwise this democracy does not function.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest, Sir, that you reconsider what you have announced in consultation with the relevant representatives of the parties so that we find a way of continuing to make this House relevant. Sadly, that is not what is happening in the wider field.</P>

        <b>:</b> If the Dáil has any relevance we must be able to raise issues of public importance as soon as it meets, and the Order of Business is when this can be done. It is not acceptable that small parties, single Deputy parties etc. would be excluded from this process and that only the Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour would be able to intervene. They do not speak for me. In the drawing up of a new Standing Order &ndash; you, Sir, said it has to be stated categorically what is and is not allowable &ndash; everyone accepts that the bigger parties will have much more time. A total exclusion of small parties from making any comment is not acceptable. We want our democratic right in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point, without answering any of the points made. As a former Leader of the Opposition and now as Taoiseach I know better than anyone else in the House how the system works on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe. On the ruling, I make the point to all my colleagues, including those on this side of the House, that what the Ceann Comhairle operated from 1997 was an enormous change from the previous position when it was strictly matters of legislation under Standing Order 26A which could be raised. We then allowed topical issues to be raised &ndash; the Ceann Comhairle made two statements. This has been stretched left, right and centre. I have played my part in the lack of order by simply going along with it. However, this is not the only issue.</P>
      <P>There is a number of important issues which need to be raised. If we really are serious &ndash; and sometimes I wonder about this &ndash; about making the House relevant we could look at these issues. I am not against this ruling or some of the other issues in principle. As I have stated previously, the Taoiseach of the day spends an average of three hours on the floor of the House each day. This does not happen anywhere else in Europe. It is the most accountable &ndash; this was the same in the past &ndash; and, under the new rules, the most open Parliament. Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to work with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Dáil reform in the <Col N="6" /> best interests of Members, while understanding your dilemma, a Cheann Comhairle. You have been more generous than anyone has ever been. That is a fact&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to rebut that perception, I ask you to use your offices to facilitate the early convening of the appropriate committee with a view to drafting today a Standing Order which will meet your requirement and allow issues of a topical nature to be raised, as has been the practice in the House in recent years. I think you will agree with the importance of having the parameters of such a measure contained in Standing Orders and I appeal to you to facilitate positive activity in that regard today and no later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party understands the predicament in which you find yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, given the origins of the convention now under discussion. Northern Ireland was the focus of the statements at the time of the initiation of the convention when there was a national and international crisis in terms of violent activity. Will the Ceann Comhairle bear in mind the development in that crisis when we are looking at this Standing Order and taking into account that there is now an inclusive assembly in Northern Ireland as a result of the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the revised Standing Order should reflect that inclusive development in this House so that, whatever convention is decided upon, smaller parties will not be excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the sub-committee. The Deputy's party has a very able representative on that sub-committee who, I am sure, will put forward that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing the Taoiseach has said gives me confidence that he recognises the importance of the Chair's statement and exhortation today that Standing Orders must be changed in order that tomorrow we will be able to continue with the practice he has allowed in recent months. I ask again for a firm commitment from the Minister of State who chairs the committee on Standing Orders that he will convene a meeting of that committee today. The amendment needed to Standing Orders does not involve rocket science. It would be a very simple amendment in order that we may proceed tomorrow morning to raise issues that are current and will be silenced only today in relation to such issues. The Taoiseach lauds himself on being on his feet for three hours in this House dealing with issues that have been raised. However, by the time the issues are dealt with they are not as relevant as they were four days previously when the question was put down. Therefore, the method of putting questions to the Taoiseach should also be examined as part of our programme for democratic revolution, and consideration given to providing for much shorter notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, but it is not enough to finish this debate without a commit<Col N="8" /> ment from the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan that he will convene a meeting of the Standing Order Committee today. We would have no problem in amending the Standing Orders at 2.30 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. in order that tomorrow morning the procedure allowed by the Ceann Comhairle up to now can resume and leaders of parties can raise matters of topical interest. We need that commitment now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle you, as Ceann Comhairle, are also chairperson of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges. Since you have seen fit to raise this matter in the manner that you have, I ask that you convene a meeting of the committee to discuss this matter as a matter of urgency. This matter requires the participation of the full membership of the committee, which is representative of all of the Members of this House and not just the Whips of the main parties. It is necessary for the committee to look at the matter you have seen fit to bring before this House, to assist you in the interpretation of the rules so that you can enable every Member of this House to raise matters of concern provided they are in order, and I fully accept that that is your sole concern and that you are not exercising censorship. However, to facilitate you in maintaining order and to enable us to do our task in this Assembly, I urgently request that you convene a meeting of Committee on Procedure and Privileges some time today to address the net point that has arisen this morning and which you saw fit to bring before this House, so that we can continue in the spirit of what you set about in the first instance, but within a framework of rules and standards that are clearly understood by all of us.</P>

      <P>I will consider what the Deputy has said, but I point out that the committee is a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges which gave the sub-committee the power to deal with Dáil reform. I will consider the Deputy's main point and come back to him.</P>

      <P>Let me explain something so that there will not be a sense of non-co-operation.

This is a net point about procedure on a single issue in this House, not the reform of the Dáil <i>per se</i>, and because you, a Cheann Comhairle, correctly saw fit to raise it in the manner in which you did, I respectfully suggest that it is not the remit of the so-called committee on Dáil reform, which is now defunct, but of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, which you chair, and that you take that point on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is quite right to seek an amendment to the Standing Orders. However, the arbitrary withdrawal of the existing informal practice pending agreement on a new Standing Order is of concern for two reasons. It may be difficult to get agreement quickly on a new Standing Order. In the short-term that gives undue influence to those who would want a restrictive Standing Order. I urge you to reconsider the withdrawal of the informal arrangement given the view of the House that we need a new Standing Order. Let us all work together to get that agreed as quickly as possible but in the meantime let us not axe the existing informal arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to make the same point as Deputy O'Keeffe. It is important that you should retain the initiative and continue with the existing procedure until a satisfactory alternative Standing Order is put before the House. You are the guardian, particularly of those who are not in a majority in the House. You have done what was correct for the Chair and have acted entirely properly. You should not be forced to withdraw the interpretation you have made until an alternative satisfactory Standing Order is put in place. I strongly back Deputy O'Keeffe and ask you to consider his proposal as an alternative approach, bearing in mind your desire to have this situation formalised, which is perfectly understandable.</P>

      <P>No. 127 on the D list of pending legislation is the Aer Lingus 2000 Bill. When is that Bill likely to be introduced in the House? Is the Taoiseach aware that, pending this legislation, cabin crew in Aer Lingus are on strike today and have threatened at least two more days of strike, which will bring all Aer Lingus flights to a standstill, thereby damaging the economic well-being of the country, and the needs of commuters and air passengers to and from the country? We have been put off again and again in relation to this Bill. What is the Government's intention in regard to this legislation? Perhaps in relation to the Aviation Regulation Bill, which has been ordered for today, the relevant Minister will take the opportunity to make a statement about what the Government intends to do to ensure that Aer Lingus staff can return to work with a decent wage?</P>

        <b>: </b>On promised legislation, the rail safety programme for 28 mainline stations, Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Tralee, has been suspended because of the mini CTC scandal. Furthermore, an internal memorandum in the Department of Public Enterprise complains at the failure of Iarnród Éireann to respond to queries from the railway inspectorate. In light of those two important developments and the implications for rail safety, why has the rail safety Bill been relegated to section C, no. 106 and been left languishing at the bottom of priorities? Why has greater importance not been given to it? Why has it not been front loaded to be part of the legislative programme for the spring session?</P>

There has been intensive co-operation for many years between EU customs administrations which allow for a constant flow in intelligence and exchange of information to combat international smuggling and the value of that co-operation has been well illustrated over the years. The measures proposed in this Bill will no doubt enhance that co-operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister of State said he would take on board the various suggestions of Members. I expressed a concern that while we welcomed co-operation at international level to help prevent smuggling, particularly of drugs, I was concerned with Irish agencies working to the best of their ability to combat <Col N="16" /> organised crime, both within and without the country. I felt there was a lack of co-ordination and co-operation among those agencies within the country. It often manifests itself when a drug haul has been seized by customs, the Naval Service or the Garda. When the drug haul is displayed afterwards there is a blatant lack of co-ordination and co-operation between the agencies. When they have all been involved in an operation it is necessary that they be seen together. All too often we see one or other agency rush to display the haul separately from the other organisations. There should be provisions in this and other Bills to ensure greater co-ordination of the work involved.</P>
      <P>All sides welcomed this legislation, as anything that can help to stem the tide of drugs into the country is worthwhile. Things have changed dramatically in Europe in the past ten to 15 years, as the dismantling of boundaries means there is to be freer movement now than before. Without co-operation on intelligence between countries it would be far more difficult to combat organised crime. Drugs are a problem not just in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. Every town and village has this problem and while customs and excise cannot deal with all those problems, we depend on the Garda for protection. It is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform makes additional manpower, facilities and funding available to the Garda and all the other agencies involved to enable them continue their excellent work and, once and for all, to eliminate or reduce substantially the evils that occur.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that an increasing proportion of crime is related to the illicit drugs trade. However, the Government has failed miserably to stem the growth of the drugs trade. It is only nibbling at the edges. However, that is not the only problem. Last week, organised criminals were able to stop the transit of a prisoner on a country road and release him. This is an indication that there are organised criminals within the State. The manpower needed would be in addition to the co-operation that is needed from outside the State in this area. There is an urgent need for the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to reassess the current position. We are losing the battle. Statistics can be used to prove anything &ndash; for example, that the level of crime is down. However, in broad daylight&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke's case for preferment is well made and no doubt it will be heard in the portals that matter. I am happy to facilitate the passage of the Bill. I do not wish to repeat my Second Stage contribution, but it is remarkable that, in some cases, the Revenue Commissioners' range of powers in dealing with customs matters now dwarfs the powers of the Garda. While I am sure all Members are happy to facilitate the forces of the State, including the Revenue Commissioners, in dealing with matters such as the exchange of intelligence and information and actions to combat crime and smuggling, there is a need to have due regard to and be appropriately vigilant in ensuring people's civil and human rights are respected. I am happy to facilitate the Bill and I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their co-operation in bringing it to this point.</P>

I note Deputy Burke's contribution, which, although important, I did not think would arise when the Bill was almost passed. However, I reassure him that some of the matters he raised are fundamental to the Bill. They are part of the reason the Bill has been expedited by the House and I appreciate the co-operation I received in that regard.</P>
      <P>Regarding the position within the country, a memorandum of understanding was completed some time ago between the Garda and Customs and Excise. At the end of last year, an operational protocol to flesh out and clarify matters, such as those raised by the Deputy, was signed. This will enhance co-operation on the island. The Bill is welcome and will make a major contribution to our ability to deal with international crime.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;airport user' means any person responsible for the carriage of passengers, mail or freight to or from an airport;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is most appropriate in terms of section 2 of the Bill which deals with interpretation and definitions. The various elements are all clearly defined, for example, &ldquo;airport&rdquo;, &ldquo;airport authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;airport charges&rdquo; have the meanings assigned to them in the 1998 Act. An authorised officer is a person appointed under section 41 to be an authorised officer and &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means Commission for Aviation Regulation established under section 5. It is peculiar to omit the individual or body to whom the airport is supposed to relate.</P>
      <P>The person using the airport is not in any way defined. This is why I tabled the amendment and the definition should be included. I understand this was the precise definition in the original draft of the Bill. It was argued on Committee Stage that this could conceivably be interpreted to mean a person driving a bus to and from an airport and having passengers therein, etc. However, it is peculiar that the Department, having included this definition in the original draft, did not adopt it in the Bill as it stands or come up with a more finely crafted alternative.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said on Committee Stage, we are not minded to use the Deputy's wording as it omits the reference to the term &ldquo;by air&rdquo;. However, I am agreeable to reinserting the original definition and this is referred to in section 40. I hope this is satisfactory.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&ndash;The Minister for Public Enterprise, in conjunction with the Commission for Aviation Regulation, shall ensure that all agencies permitted to work in the operational area of State aerodromes and licensed aerodromes in handling activities which impact on the safety of aircraft have the necessary competencies in their related field to ensure safety of operations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deals with the functions of the commission. It sets down the commission functions precisely in three subsections. It states that the commission shall be the competent authority in the State for the purpose of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 95/33 other than the functions of the co-ordinator; that the Commission shall have the function of appointing a co-ordinator under Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 95/33; and that the Commission shall have the function of licensing air carriers under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2407/92 of 23 July 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told by more than one source that there is an omission in the Bill in that the area of airport safety is not addressed or mentioned as such. Given that we are appointing somebody here with a view to having that person act as regulator, overseer or supervisor, surely from the point of view of airport safety we should assign that ultimate responsibility to both the Minister and the Commissioner. The amendment inserts a measure to ensure that there is some ultimate guarantor of airport safety. This is the most <Col N="20" /> appropriate place to insert this amendment, although possibly one could argue about that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is a fact of life that there are instances of air rage on an ongoing basis. Last week there was an example of it, where somebody had to be taken forcibly from an Aer Lingus plane, hauled before the courts and remanded on bail. Such incidents occur week in, week out. There was the famous case of the Orlando 12. Life has become extremely difficult for cabin crews. People come unannounced charging up the aisle of a plane into the cockpit and in some cases try to wrest the controls of the plane from the captain or pilot. We cannot be stringent enough regarding air safety and that is the reason I propose to insert this amendment here. It seeks that the track record of all agencies permitted to work in the operational area of State aerodromes and licensed aerodromes, their <i>curriculum vitae</i> and ability to do their job are vetted thoroughly and that the ultimate responsibility for this should rest with the Commissioner, who, after all, is the person responsible for issuing aircraft licences to companies. The Commission should also be responsible for ensuring that persons operating within the zone of the airport have had their backgrounds thoroughly vetted and approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here relates to the piece of ground between the building and the aircraft. There is a greyness about the responsibility in that area. We were conscious of the fact that a number of accidents arose in that particular area. Whereas the Health and Safety Authority would have a general overall remit in the country, including that piece of ground of the airport, it would not have a hands-on control of safety. We felt it was important that a specific authority, the Irish Aviation Authority, would have control of safety in the general airline business and that its remit would be broadened from the door of the plane to the door of the building because that was where the difficulty lay. I would ask the Minister to respond to what we are saying in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment relates to the ground-handling issues. He referred to air rage, with which we will deal later.</P>
      <P>The importance of safety in the aviation area cannot be over-emphasised and there must be clear lines of authority and responsibility for activities surrounding an aircraft while it is on the ground as well as in the air. As the Minister for Public Enterprise pointed out on Committee Stage, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Authority are liaising closely on the issue of safety regarding ground-handling activities. These agencies have now compiled a draft memorandum of understanding regarding their respective roles and responsibilities and are continuing to maintain close consultation with each other on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Department again met the IAA recently on this issue and that authority is satisfied that there is no gap in the regulatory cover for <Col N="21" /> ground-handling operations. Aer Rianta has extensive by-laws &ndash; S.I. 95 of 1994 &ndash; governing the ramp activities of ground-handling operations and these are very specific regarding such activities.</P>
    <P>The IAA regulates the aircraft operators who must assure the safety of their aircraft and must supervise any ground-handling activities involving their aircraft. The HSA is the national body with overall responsibility for the administration and enforcement of health and safety of workers.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage incidents which had occurred at Dublin Airport were mentioned. One of these involved a handler who suffered an injury to his foot when a tow vehicle was driven over it. That was a traffic accident and subject to both Aer Rianta's by-laws and the HSA. The other involved an engineer involved in aircraft maintenance which was investigated both by the IAA and the HSA. As the safety of aircraft was not an issue in that incident, it was the HSA rather than the IAA which prosecuted the airline. In such case, therefore, it was clear where supervisory and regulatory authority lay for such incidents. Any proposal for further regulation in this area would result in duplicating the existing responsibility of aircraft operators who are already licensed by the IAA and could result in the dissipation of safety responsibilities and confusion as to the roles of the various agencies involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise will keep this matter under review and, notwithstanding the clear advice coming from the relevant bodies that there are no gaps in the existing arrangements governing the safety of ground-handling operations, if such a gap were to emerge it will be addressed in an appropriate fashion by the Minister, including, if necessary, on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not fully satisfied by what the Minister says. He says the Health and Safety Authority is capable of doing this job. I put it to the Minister that it is not. If the HSA, with the resources available to it, tended to its business on building sites throughout the country, it would be able to deal with about 10% of them. That is according to the figures made available by the HSA itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is required here is not an overseeing body, but a hands-on policing of the regulations on a daily basis. The HSA does not have resources to do that. There are Aer Rianta by-laws but who is to police the by-laws? Is it the HSA? If so, it will not occur. What we are getting is self-regulation under an umbrella of rules by airlines in this part of the airport and it is giving rise to accidents. It was not just that a trailer was driven over somebody's foot. Another operative had his arm sucked into the engine of an aeroplane because there were airport practices which were dangerous and were against the rules, but nobody was present to ensure the rules were obeyed. A self-regulatory regime was in place to implement them. That is my concern and, while I <Col N="22" /> appreciate the Minister of State's point that it will be reviewed and examined, unless massive resources are given to the Health and Safety Authority, it will not be a hands-on policing authority for safety. It reacts to situations which are reported to it. I am concerned about the response to this and perhaps the Minister of State will re-examine it. Perhaps this safety issue in the airport might be examined in the context of promised legislation to deal with air rage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns voiced by the Deputy. This has been investigated since Committee Stage. There has been a great deal of interaction between the agencies I mentioned and the Department. As I said, the fear of the duplication or confusion of roles in this issue was a major consideration. Notwithstanding that, the matter will be kept under review and I will make a point of relaying to the Minister for Public Enterprise the concerns voiced by Deputy Stagg with a view to her re-examining it in due course. I am not in a position at this point to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Like Deputy Stagg, rather than being reassured by the Minister of State's reply, I am concerned for exactly the same reason, which is the ability and resources of the Health and Safety Authority to do the job. Building workers in Dublin have protested at the fact that the authority has been unable to achieve compliance with best practice. People have been killed on building sites and shoddy management practices on such sites have resulted in serious injury and death. The Health and Safety Authority is now being asked, albeit in conjunction with the Irish Aviation Authority, to be the guarantor of security between airport terminals and the doors of planes. It does not have the ability to do it.</P>
      <P>It is fine to talk of a draft memorandum but that is only a document which sets out what should happen. What actually happens can be far removed from the aspirations contained in the document. This amendment does not ask that the Minister be overly intrusive but that she, in co-operation with the commission, would be entitled to have officials from the safety section of the Department or officials from the commission conduct spot checks on the manner in which luggage and baggage is handled between terminal buildings and planes. That would be done in the interests of vigilance, safety and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the injuries referred to by the Minister of State, there was a high profile article, which was not denied, which stated that a major security breach had occurred at Dublin Airport. I referred to this on Committee Stage. A reporter/cameraman was able to breach security, go behind the scenes, vet aircraft unimpeded and unquestioned and enter hangars. If such a situation can arise once, it can arise again. So much for the vigilance and competence of the two agencies involved. As Deputy Stagg said, we need a <Col N="23" /> guarantee of hands-on management because, as we have seen before with the Air India jet, Lockerbie and numerous other examples where unauthorised explosive and dangerous objects were put on planes, we cannot be stringent or demanding enough when it comes to airport security. I am extremely concerned, as is Deputy Stagg, about the competence, especially of the HSA.</P>
    <P>What role do the IAA and HSA fulfil in their combined memorandum and draft document? What do they do in terms of vetting the people responsible for dealing with luggage and such items between terminals and entry points to planes?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am attempting to do, in the spirit of the Bill, is set out a mission statement outlining what ought to be considered the commendable objectives of the commission.

The purpose of the provision in the Bill is to empower the relevant Minister to give directions, as appropriate, to the commission if and when the need arises. The requirements of the aviation sector &ndash; any sector &ndash; can change rapidly and significantly and it is important that there is sufficient scope for a Minister to respond in the appropriate way. It is considered that it would not be appropriate at this juncture to seek to cite the issues on which these policy directions could be given. The whole purpose and value of the section are to keep the nature of the residual power general so as to properly address, at the relevant time, the nature and scope of the policy direction to be given.</P>

        <b>:</b> What I am attempting to insert in the Bill is a mission statement outlining what ought to be considered desirable aims and objectives, which are of a very general nature. Such matters as statistics, for example, are not specified. Part and parcel of the remit of the commission should be to foster a strong and competitive airline industry by providing enough airport capacity. That ought to be a general statement of intent. Providing enough airport capacity is vital and, given current growth rates, in the best interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>In relation to existing terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta got it dramatically wrong. It stated that passenger numbers would reach 14 million by 2005, but this figure was reached on 31 December 2000. There is ongoing chaos, particularly at peak periods, although I accept that there are peaks, troughs and valleys. Existing car parking facilities are hopelessly inadequate. Aer Rianta has, as a consequence, revised its figures. It is now talking about a figure of 30 million passengers in 15 years' time, but this appears to be an off-the-head estimate. Apart from the influx from outside, it should be borne in mind that one third of the population passes through the airport each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am attempting to do, therefore, is set <Col N="26" /> out a clear mission statement to foster a strong and competitive airline industry by ensuring there is enough airport space; to make the best use of existing facilities and provide new capacity &ndash; the Department of Finance would agree with this &ndash; where this is economically justified, and to ensure all airports aspire to and achieve the highest possible international standards. It could hardly be more general in setting out laudable aspirations and objectives which should be the norm for the airline industry and aviation policy.</P>

The correct procedure is for the Department of Finance to list by way of statutory instrument, in discussion with Departments, the appropriate bodies to be added to the list. The Department of Finance has confirmed that it will be drafting a new statutory instrument later this year. The matter can be addressed at that stage. By virtue of the amendment, I assume Deputy Higgins will not pursue amendment No. 7.</P>

        <b>:</b> The reason I have tabled amendment No. 7 is that it is important that the individuals involved are brought within the scope of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. The investigation of public affairs has, unfortunately, moved to a new gear. Until recently the emphasis and focus were on politicians. Now public officials are coming under scrutiny in terms of their misdemeanours and obvious conflicts of interest, as a result of which people have had to resign. As a consequence, we cannot be stringent or demanding enough in applying the exact same standards that apply to those in the political sphere to those involved in handling sensitive commercial information or decision-making. Best practice and best standards should apply across the board.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 1 to 3, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The penalties for contravening this Act shall be as per section 7 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to section 19 which deals with the prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information.</P>
      <P>Section 19 states:</P>
      <P>(1) Save as otherwise provided by law, a person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing duties as a commissioner, member of the staff of, or an adviser or consultant to, or as an authorised officer of, the Commission, unless he or she is duly authorised by the Commission to do so.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who contravenes <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500.</P>
      <P>I was briefed by Aer Rianta, the airport authority, on this section. Aer Rianta is extremely concerned that the penalty is inadequate in the context of what could be gained by an individual from the disclosure of confidential information. I agree with the suggestion put to me that there is a considerable need to increase the penalty. I welcome the Minister's amendment which increases the penalty by providing for the option of a prison sentence not exceeding six months but there is no valid reason the same penalty which applies under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, cannot apply under this legislation. The penalty is too low to act as a deterrent given the serious business implications of any contravention of the section. That is the reason section 7 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, should apply, which provides for a penalty not exceeding £100,000 similar to any financial sanction in legislation. The penalty could be £5,000 depending on the gravity of the misdemeanour involved. I will press the amendment.</P>

We, however, again asked the AG's office if this was still its position and it has been agreed to add a custodial sentence of six months to the summary fine. This measure reflects the fact that the offence is of a summary nature.</P>

      <P>Section 23, which relates to the levy that may be imposed in regard to the running costs of the commission, states:</P>
      <P>(1) For the purpose of meeting expenses properly incurred by the Commission in the discharge of the functions of this Act, the Commission may make regulations imposing a levy (&ldquo;levy&rdquo;), to meet but not to exceed the estimated operating costs and expenses of the Commission, to be paid each year beginning with such year as specified in the regulations on such classes of undertakings as may be specified by the Commission in the regulations.</P>
      <P>(2) Levy shall be payable to the Commission at such time and at such rates as may be prescribed in regulations by the Commission and different rates in respect of different classes of undertaking liable to pay levy.</P>
      <P>I propose to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to render the costs of regulations transparent to all users, such part of the levy as is imposed on an airport authority shall be an incremental and identified sum which shall be charged in addition to the airport charges and shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> The amendment relates to transparency.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I stated the amendment was necessary to ensure transparency and it is entirely appropriate that the commission which is set up to regulate an undertaking with market power should be subject to the discipline of transparency. The amendment is also required to ensure the levy imposed by the commission for aviation regulation is appropriately distributed. The cost associated with economic regulation is a legitimate, externally imposed expense over which the airport authority has absolutely no discretion and, therefore, it is appropriate that it be passed on to the airport authority and the users in a transparent, up front manner. How the levy has arisen should be broken down in detail. This is in keeping with best practice in other jurisdictions in which independent economic regulation pertains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concerns regarding transparency are addressed by virtue of the fact that the levy and the basis and manner of its collection will be announced by way of regulations. The cost of the levy, as with all other costs, will be part of the cost structure, which the commission will examine in respect of Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority. There appeared to be misunderstanding on Committee Stage in regard to how the levy might be imposed. For example, there was a view that different percentages of Aer Rianta's revenue from car parking or retail outlets would be surrendered to fund the costs of the commission. It will be a matter for the commission after appropriate analysis to decide the basis of the levy. However, if it were to follow the UK example it would base the levy on cost per passenger.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The Bill provides in section 32(2) that the commission has a timeframe of up to 12 months to produce a determination on the price cap. This was an appropriate measure when it was included. However, further consideration has been given to the implications for the industry if a price cap were not determined for a further year. Given the long period of time since there was an increase in the charges in 1987 and given that due to delays in the legislative process an interim commission has been in place since autumn 1999, albeit informally, and has engaged in familiarising itself with the relevant issues, it has been decided that it would be more appropriate at this juncture to reduce the timeframe to six months.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 arises by virtue of amendment No. 12 and is designed to reflect the fact that the timeframe for the price cap determination is reduced to six months. We are, therefore, reducing from two months to one month the consultation period for industry views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>I support the amendment. We were conscious when we discussed the issue on Committee Stage that the commissioner had been appointed without legal authority. I am not saying his appointment was <i>ultra vires</i> but it was unusual. He was appointed and was paid for a long period before he was entitled to function legally. Perhaps we will secure some retrospection from the commissioner by shortening the period and getting him to give decisions in a shorter timeframe.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment would have the effect of providing for the regulation of Aer Rianta as a group as opposed to permitting the commission the discretion to evaluate whether to regulate the three airports separately or as a group. The rationale supporting the provision in the Bill was that it is essential from the standpoint of good regulation, now that we are committed to independent regulation, that the regulator be given sufficient flexibility to address the charges issue as his examination of the situation dictates. It would be pre-emptive to fetter the commission's discretion in advance of the establishment of the facts. Only proper economic analysis will reveal the basis on which the charges should be regulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the argument the Minister made on Committee Stage. She subsequently <Col N="31" /> withdrew it on the basis of her acceptance of the threat it poses to Cork and Shannon. While that might be more a perception than reality, the Minister was acutely aware that that was the case. Those airports saw this as a threat that they would be isolated and dealt with separately and that an unsympathetic Dublin based regulatory system would deal them a cold hand rather than a helping hand. The note I have from the Committee Stage debate was that the Minister would deal with this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This relates to decisions or determinations made in respect of airport charges. The provision states that the determination shall &ldquo;be in force for a period of 5 years&rdquo;. In other words, it should be mandatory that it operate for a minimum of five years and &ldquo;come into operation not later than 30 days after the making of such a determination&rdquo;. We discussed this at length on Committee Stage.

      <P>To proceed with this amendment would lead to uncertainty for the industry. Certainty is one of the primary features regulation is designed to achieve.

      <P>I am seeking to insert this amendment to state that the cost of meeting international obligations shall be included when assessing and setting the level of airport charges. I am not aware whether the Minister or the Department have received representations from Aer Rianta, which is seeking this provision. Effectively, Aer Rianta is saying that airport authorities have a number of public policy obligations at a national level, for example, the provision of VIP facilities, costs associated with ceremonial functions, etc., which in some cases are additional to the requirements to facilitate the current and prospective needs of those for whom airport charges are levied. Therefore, it would be appropriate that public policy expectations and obligations would be considered by the commission in formulating a determination on airport charges.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) environmental protection and noise pollution reduction and the desirability of structuring charges so as to reduce noise,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The objective here is to create a mechanism whereby charges can be used as a tool to encourage positive environmental activity at the airport. Only yesterday, I received a summary of a report on airport charges by the Director General of Civil Aviation in the Netherlands. The report states that the lowest airport charges are found in southern Europe and Ireland, a fact which was immediately rubbished by the aforementioned Michael who rubbishes every positive aspect of Aer Rianta. The report also makes the point that the reason charges were higher in other European airports was that different night charges applied due to the environmental effect of night flights on people and special charges applied to planes with higher noise pollution emissions. I was seeking through this amendment to introduce a similar regime here without being prescriptive in regard to what charges should apply as that would be a matter for the commission.</P>

      <P>The EU is attempting to make further advances on the issue of noise and we are participating in this initiative through the transport councils. On the specific issue of lower charges for quiet aircraft, the policy internationally has been to leave this matter to the airport authorities as it affects their revenue generating powers. This is the case in the UK and throughout Europe. At present, we could only ask Aer Rianta to consider a reduced charge in respect of less noisy aircraft. If it were to implement such an initiative, that would require compliance with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination and would have to accord with all EU measures on the matter. We can discuss the matter with Aer Rianta and consider the available options.</P>

I am concerned by the Minister's comment that any measures in this area would have to be non-discriminatory.

      <P>The amendment relates to section 33(<i>e</i>) which refers to the level of income of the airport authority from airport charges at the airport and other revenue earned by the authority at the regulated airports. Section 33(<i>b</i>) reads: &ldquo;a reasonable rate of return on capital employed in that investment, in the context of the sustainable and profitable operation of the airport&rdquo;. The amendment seeks the insertion of &ldquo;airport&rdquo; after &ldquo;other&rdquo; in line 27 to make the paragraph read &ldquo;the level of income of the airport authority from airport charges at the airport and other airport revenue earned by the authority at the regulated airports&rdquo;. We were trying, in this instance again, to ensure that incomes from other commercial activities by the airport authority would not be taken into account in assessing what it does. The Great Southern Hotels group is probably the best example. If it is profitable, should the amount of income available to Aer Rianta for running the airport be reduced as its hotels are profitable in, say, Kerry or wherever they might be? That is the point we make. If we put in the word &ldquo;airport&rdquo; there it might cover that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

      <P>A basic ethos in the drafting of this legislation has been to provide the commission with a sufficient level of flexibility to address all the salient issues before arriving at its decisions. It would be an imprudent measure to seek to constrain its discretion in respect of the totality of Aer Rianta's revenue in advance of an examination of all matters necessary to determine a price cap decision.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 is a critical one which provides that the commission is entitled to have regard to all the income of the airport authority, not just that arising from the airports themselves but from other external sources, for example, Aer Rianta International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the amendment adding the words &ldquo;at the regulated airports&rdquo; was accepted by the Minister for Public Enterprise on Committee Stage she considered that it simply meant at airports amenable to regulation, that is, those having over one million passengers annually. However, as its effect is to exclude the ability of the commission <Col N="35" /> to have regard to all sources of revenue, it is important to address this issue in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister pointed out clearly that if we reduce the charges required for running Dublin Airport on the basis of the profitability of Aer Rianta outside Dublin Airport, we will simply put more money into the pockets of people like Ryanair, who are doing very well at Dublin Airport already. The profits of the taxpayers' company, Aer Rianta, will be used to reduce the charges required to run the airport. The Minister accepted that and made that argument on Committee Stage. I am, therefore, amazed that it is being rolled back now. I ask that the original decision made on Committee Stage would stand. It is not acceptable that on Report Stage, when there is not an opportunity to revisit a Bill that has gone through the Seanad, we are told this change will be rolled back.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted this point on Committee Stage when we made the argument. She supported and fortified this argument by making the point that moneys made, particularly by Aer Rianta International, would now be a waste of effort because, for every pound made in Moscow, Ryanair, Aer Lingus and other users of Dublin Airport &ndash; it is not fair to single out Ryanair &ndash;  will get a pound less on their charges.</P>
      <P>What is the object of the excercise of Aer Rianta being successful internationally? Is it to have a free airport? If so, let us say it is to have a free airport with no charges, subvented by the other commercial activity of Aer Rianta outside the airport. That is crazy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has only one more short bite at this and I ask that he seriously consider what he is doing here.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 24.</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k)the contribution of the airport to balanced regional development,</P>
      <P>(l)the provision of adequate and proper facilities for disabled passengers using the airport, and</P>
      <P>(m)the promotion and development of air traffic at airports under the aegis of the Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with section 33 and these are the regulatory objectives in respect of airport charges. The introduction to this section states: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;In making a determination the Commission shall aim to facilitate the development and operation of cost-effective airports which meet the requirements of users and shall have due regard to&ndash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the commercial interest or welfare and different elements to which the commission shall have regard, such as the level of investment in airport facilities at an airport, a reasonable rate of return on capital, the efficient and effective use of all resources and the contribution of the airport to the region in which it is located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other elements include the level of income of <Col N="37" /> the airport authority from airport charges and other revenue earned by the authority at the regulated airports, operating and other costs incurred by the airport authority, the level and quality of services offered, the cost competitiveness and operational efficiency of airport services at the airport with respect to best international practice, imposing the minimum restrictions on the airport authority consistent with the functions of the commission and such national and international obligations as are relevant to its functions. I seek to insert three sub-paragraphs which make sense and for which we argued on Committee Stage, that is, sub-paragraphs (k), (l) and (m). This would mean that, in other words, the regulating commission or commissioner would have regard, additionally, to &ldquo;the contribution of the airport to balanced regional development&rdquo;. We have argued that at length already but from the point of view of the airport itself and its role in the region.</P>
    <P>As we have had the contribution of the airport to balanced regional development, I am particularly worried about the provision of adequate and proper facilities for disabled passengers using the airport. There is a marked contrast between the level of services available to people with disabilities, particularly physical disabilities, at our airports compared with international airports. As soon as a disabled person arrives at an airport in any major capital city, be it London, Amsterdam or elsewhere, an automated buggy is provided to transport him or her around the airport. That is not the case here. Recently we had the appalling case of Ryanair charging an additional amount for a disabled person to use a wheelchair. From the point of view of best practice, adequate and proper facilities for disabled passengers should be provided at airports. Aer Rianta is making colossal profits. We might question the level of service provided at times but commercially it is an extremely profitable entity. It has an obligation to provide the best service possible for people, particularly for those who use wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>I recently convened the Dublin Airport users forum in the Great Southern Hotel at the airport. Some of the organisations which represent people with disabilities were present and were vocal regarding the lack of facilities for such people at airports. The commission should have due regard to this. In making his or her determination the regulator should have regard to the promotion and development of air traffic at airports under the aegis of the commission, which is the oxygen necessary for airports to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>What is sought in the amendment is not appropriate for inclusion as regulatory objectives. As regards paragraph (<i>k</i>), this is already catered for in this section and in section 10. As regards paragraph (<i>l</i>), this type of provision is catered for in section 33 in that Aer Rianta is required to invest in whatever facilities are necessary for the users of the airport. This means all users, including the disabled. It would not be <Col N="38" /> appropriate to single out any category of passenger as being distinct from the needs of other users. As regards the disabled, Aer Rianta possesses wide-ranging powers to make by-laws at the State airports and has already adopted a by-law, S.I. 469 of 1999, specifically requiring all airlines, service providers and other agencies to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of persons with a disability by providing special treatment or facilities if, without such special treatment or facilities, it would be impossible or unduly difficult for these persons to avail of the service.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's third point, paragraph (<i>m</i>), this objective is the responsibility of the airport authority and is cited as such in Aer Rianta's shareholder mandate in the Department's statement of strategy.</P>

        <b>:</b> I appreciate what the Minister said regarding the obligations imposed on Aer Rianta and take the point that investment and development is enshrined in the section, but I am at a loss to know why the spirit of the other two sections cannot be embraced as elements that would be taken into consideration in making a determination. Those representing the Federation of People with Disabilities are extremely critical of this. There can be difficulties on aircraft but I do not understand why, with the massive expansion, development and huge investment of resources in upgrading facilities within the airport complex, we would not set down this as something to be taken into consideration in making a determination. Similarly in regard to the commercial promotion of the airport, I do not see why the promotion of traffic should not be set down as an element to be taken into consideration particularly when we consider that an airport is all about generating income based on the throughput of aircraft traffic and freight.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;38.&ndash;An airport authority or an airport user shall be entitled to appeal to the High Court against any determination or decision of the Commission, or any party thereof, on a point of law or fact.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We argued this on Committee Stage and there was a major conflict on the role, remit and powers of the commission and where we should draw the line. The right of appeal was also raised. At present there is no appeal mechanism other than by way of judicial review which is very limited in terms of its scope. One can challenge the legality of something only on the basis of technical details. In other words, one can go to the courts only on the basis of there being a technical difficulty or irregularity regarding the manner in which the decision was made. Because it is such a vital economic interest, in the event of the commission getting it wrong or there being a question mark over the determination or the decision made, there should be some appeal mechanism. It should allow people the right to have an argument heard so that a decision can be vetted and the matter decided on a second time. In other words, we are giving absolute decision-making powers in relation to a huge economic interest to one particular body, the commission. We are questioning whether that is wise and that is the reason I tabled this amendment. I argued on Committee Stage &ndash; I do not want to recite the arguments again &ndash; that an airport authority or user shall be entitled to appeal to the High Court against any determination or decision of the commission, or any party thereof, on a point of law or fact. In other words, if they believe they have a legitimate case or claim, they would be entitled to go before the courts to have the case heard a second time and decided upon.</P>

      <P>The issue in relation to amendment No. 31 was discussed at length in committee both in the Dáil and the Seanad. The amendment provides for a <i>de novo</i> appeal on the merits of the <Col N="41" /> case. This would make the court, in effect, the regulator. The Attorney General's office advised from the outset that it would not be appropriate to place the court in the position of substituting its decision for that of the regulator. We have adequately provided for judicial review measures, which, according to the Attorney General, is the appropriate course in the case of decisions by public bodies, that is, the courts can decide if the decision taken by the public body is reasonable and in accordance with its powers under the legislation or whether it is <i>ultra vires</i> or biased etc. It is fair to say that the court would not be in a position to have the sectoral economic expertise to make the decision. To add to the judicial review measures, we have now provided for an appeal mechanism by way of an independent panel. That is contained in section 40.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 32 appears to seek to provide for both an appeal to the courts on the merits of the case in addition to a judicial review. I have outlined the position on this issue in relation to amendment No. 31. In any event, it would appear that this amendment only addresses the issue of allowing Aer Rianta or any airline to seek a judicial review.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 33, the position here is as in the previous amendments on the subject in that we are providing for an independent appeal. In relation to the final amendment, having considered the many contributions made both in the Seanad and the Dáil&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not the Minister's fault. This is the most difficult area in the matter of setting up a regulator. We have dealt with who he or she should be accountable to, and we have difficulty with that because it creates a democratic deficit in that we are transferring authority to quangos outside this House without having a clear line of how they will report back to us. That created difficulty. This is the other area about appeals. If we set up an authority to do a job without setting up some form of appeal mechanism against the decisions they make, inevitably the courts would become the regulators. Because of the money that is involved here, the decisions will end up before the courts, if not to change the decision to delay it, and a decision can be delayed for a long time by a competitor going through the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the panel appeal proposal a number of times and I am not clear how it will work. I did <Col N="42" /> not have an opportunity to get legal people to examine it for me. Perhaps the Minister has had an opportunity to do that so perhaps he will tell us in plain language how this will work without dragging in the courts on every occasion. The judicial review facility will be there no matter what we do, and rightly so, but that is a very limited format. It only deals with whether decisions were made correctly, not about the actual content of the decision. We cannot exclude that but I am not sure how this will work and I would like the Minister to elaborate on it. I will withdraw my amendment in favour of some system but we have to get this matter on the agenda by saying the High Court will be the appeal mechanism.</P>

The system is based on the appointment of the electricity regulator and will be provided for in the ODTR in the future. The three independent persons appointed by the Minister will have expertise in the areas of aviation, economics, etc. They will either confirm the commission's decision or refer it back to it for further consideration if it believes it did not have sufficient regard to the provisions of sections 33 and 36.

        <b>:</b> It does. I welcome the fact that these three independent persons will have due regard to the various interests and arguments <Col N="43" /> made and will be able to refer the matter back to the commission for further consideration if they believe it did not take into consideration elements or aspects which should be taken into consideration. It was never our intention to trespass unduly on the determination of the commission but we believed there should be some other court of appeal, so to speak. We were not terribly enamoured of the idea of going to court, which could end up as the regulator. We accept the argument that there is little point in setting up a commission if its decisions will be questioned in the courts on an ongoing basis. Everything would be held up as the courts are tedious and their deliberations protracted. There is also the cost factor, which is considerable. The people who would invariably have recourse to the courts are the fat cats, the airlines. The smaller interest groups, the users, would not have the resources to go to court and take on a legal challenge.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come a fair bit of the road with us in terms of setting up the panel of three independent persons. It is a considerable advance on the initial provision whereby the decision-making process was left entirely to the commission with no right of recourse or redress other than by way of a judicial review, which is limited in terms of its scope and possibility.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has explained, it would not be appropriate to use this Bill to address the issue of air rage. The Deputy has acknowledged this. Given the activities already taking place in the work programmes of ECAC and ICAO it would be pre-emptive to move unilaterally with air rage provisions. In any event, legislation dealing with airport charges is not an appropriate vehicle to address an issue as critical as aircraft passenger safety. As promised by the Minister, the air rage issue will be addressed in due course in separate legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for considering our amendments to this important legislation dealing with aviation regulation. I also thank his officials for their positive and helpful attitude in assisting us to do the job we are required to do on behalf of the electorate.</P>
      <P>We have broken new ground in this Bill, particularly in regard to the appeals mechanism. This will set an example for future regulatory legislation. It is important that we are careful in expanding the regulatory system. If we had continued the way we started &ndash; I was directly involved in introducing the first Bill &ndash; the House would be denuded of much of its authority and the combined regulators would be more powerful than the Minister and probably more powerful than a group of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill had an unusual First Stage as the main debate was about a peripheral issue, Baldonnel <Col N="46" /> Airport. This gave rise to a huge public campaign to have a section removed from the Bill. Being the good politician that she is, the Minister took on board the concerns expressed and the section was removed, thereby diffusing the row. I thank the Minister for doing this.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation, even though the Comptroller and Auditor General will probably ask the Minister why she has been paying a regulator with no authority since last May. I wish the regulator well. He has a difficult job to do and will have a few hot potatoes to handle, as well as dealing with the people who keep putting the fire under these potatoes. He will have plenty of excitement in his new regime. I wish him well and remind him that under this legislation we will monitor his activities on behalf of the people who have given us the authority to do so.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to present to the House the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000. This Bill is a first, not just in Ireland but, I would confidently say, in Europe, where the State, through the provision of carer's leave, will allow people to take temporary leave from their employment for up to 15 months or 65 weeks to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>In today's world, people's expectations are far different from what they were ten or even five years ago. With our booming economy, people's quality of life has improved immensely. People now have more disposable income. The number of people in employment has risen from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.67 million today, an increase of 450,000, or 37%. Allied to this is the fact that there are some 270,000 part-time employees in the workforce, the majority being women. All of these healthy and welcome developments have created a new scenario in society i.e. that of balancing the needs and demands of the workplace with those similar needs and demands outside it. This is sometimes described as the formulation of &ldquo;family-friendly&rdquo; policies.</P>
      <P>Why do we need &ldquo;family-friendly&rdquo; policies? In an Irish context, the answer is quite simple. The family has and will continue to be the cornerstone on which our society is built. This Government is committed to continually reviewing its policies on how to successfully marry the changing needs of the workplace with the ever-growing demands of family life. Family-friendly workplace arrangements allow us to address the need to reconcile work and family life to the mutual benefit of workers and employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that we are debating the Carer's Leave Bill. This Bill, taken together with the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, which I hope we can bring to Second Stage very soon, and the budget announcement of extended maternity leave <Col N="48" /> entitlements, bear testament to this Government's commitment to fostering family-friendly arrangements which are in harmony with the needs of our dynamic and enterprising economy.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, people are living longer. Recent actuarial research suggests that in the near future life expectancy could be as high as 120 years. We all know that this will not be the reality. However, the message is stark. As we move into the new millennium, life expectancy is growing and, as a consequence, major demographic changes in terms of the age profile of our population are happening on an ongoing basis. In order to address these concerns, the Government has already provided that pension costs for future generations will be met, in part, from some of our current budget surplus. This initiative, which is overseen by the National Treasury Management Agency, has been widely welcomed as being innovative and far-reaching.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, we must also look at what other initiatives are needed to cater for the needs of an ageing population.</P>
    <P>One such obvious area is that of caring for our sick and elderly. Down through the years many people have made &ndash; and continue to make &ndash; time available to care for our sick and elderly, be they children, parents, grandparents, relatives or just good neighbours and friends. We have, as a people, always tried to provide sick and elderly people in our community with the privacy and dignity they require in times of need, but most particularly and not least in the cases of terminally ill people, family members and relatives, in their final months and days. Many people gave freely of their time in this regard without much recourse to the State coffers. However, because of rising caring costs there has been a recognition by the State that a form of income support is needed to assist or facilitate those people who want or are required to care for persons on a short-term basis.</P>
    <P>It was against this background of fostering for future generations the culture of caring for each other that the Government announced its intention in the 2000 budget to introduce a new insurance-based carer's benefit scheme. This scheme was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, with effect from 26 October 2000. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' main criteria for entitlement to payment of carer's benefit of £88.50 per week &ndash; £96.50 per week from April &ndash; plus dependant allowances are as follows: An employee qualifies for carer's benefit if he or she satisfies the following criteria: (i) is 16 years of age, or over; (ii) satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions; (iii) has been in paid employment for the previous three-month period; (iv) leaves his or her employment to provide full-time care to a person who has been certified as in need of full-time care and attention; &ndash; this person is known as a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; under the Social Welfare Act, 2000; (vi) is not employed or self-employed <Col N="49" /> outside the &ldquo;home&rdquo; during the period of the receipt of the benefit, except as prescribed; (vii) is living in the State; and (viii) is not living in a hospital, convalescent home or other similar institution.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;relevant persons&rdquo;, the deciding officers or appeals officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will decide, on the basis of a medical assessment carried out by that Department on the basis of information provided by the person's general practitioner, whether or not the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>The PRSI contributions required for a person claiming carer's benefit for the first time are as follows: (a) 156 contributions paid since entry into insurance; (b) the person must satisfy one of the following: (i) 39 or more contributions paid in the governing contribution year; or (ii) 39 or more contributions paid in the 12 months immediately before the commencement of the benefit; or (iii) 26 contributions paid in the current governing contribution year and 26 contributions paid in the previous governing contribution year.</P>
    <P>For second or subsequent claims the employee will simply be required to have been in paid employment for the previous 13-week period, or have been in receipt of carer's benefit in that period.</P>
    <P>An employee who is entitled to carer's benefit may engage in limited self-employment within the home or employment outside the home for up to ten hours per week. The employee may also pursue an educational or training course, or take up voluntary or community work for up to ten hours per week. During such absences, adequate provision must be made for the care of the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This new insurance-based carer's benefit scheme allows employees who have been certified by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as meeting the eligibility criteria for a &ldquo;carer&rdquo;, to take temporary leave from their employment to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. This new benefit will be paid for a period of up to 65 weeks &ndash; 15 months &ndash; to those who meet the qualifying contribution conditions outlined above.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that this carer's benefit scheme should be complemented by a statutory entitlement to carer's leave &ndash; hence this Bill before the House. The provisions of this Bill will entitle employees to carer's leave and protect their employment rights over the period of the absence &ndash; and allow them to return to their jobs. Carer's leave is not simply a complement to carer's benefit, it is a significant, independent right.</P>
    <P>The Carer's Leave Bill fulfils a Government commitment in budget 2000 and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that legislation would be introduced to provide for a carer's benefit payment scheme for certain employees with a parallel right of carer's leave <Col N="50" /> for employees. In approving the drafting of this Bill, the Government directed that the provision of the carer's benefit scheme and the carer's leave scheme should be harmonised as far as possible. To that end, in preparing this legislation, my officials and officials at the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have worked closely over the past number of months with a view to aligning the schemes and the respective application procedures.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have had detailed discussions with the social partners, ICTU and IBEC, and both support the intent of the Bill. ICTU and IBEC raised a number of issues, mainly of a technical nature, that are being considered and which we can discuss further in committee.</P>
    <P>The following are key features of the carer's leave scheme, as set out in the Bill. The leave may be taken by any employee who satisfies the conditions set down in the Bill. The leave is for the purpose of personally providing full-time care to a person who is objectively assessed by deciding officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the carer's benefit scheme as being in need of full-time care and attention, and that person will be referred to as a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;. Subject to certain exceptions, the leave terminates when the employee ceases to personally provide the full-time care and attention to the relevant person, for example, where the care of that person is assumed by another person or institution. The employee must have been in the continuous employment of the employer from whose employment the leave is to be taken for at least 12 months before he or she can commence the leave. There is no minimum hours threshold. Only one employee may be on carer's leave in respect of the person being cared for at any one time. An employee is entitled to a maximum of 65 weeks in respect of any one relevant person. The 65 week entitlement may be taken as a continuous period or in separate unit periods, the aggregate duration of which does not exceed 65 weeks. An employer may refuse, without reason, to permit an employee to take carer's leave for a period of less than 13 weeks. Carer's leave is unpaid by the employer but reckonable for periods of leave of 13 weeks or less for the purposes of employment rights other than superannuation and annual leave. An employer and an employee may agree to postpone, curtail or vary the leave in any way they so wish. Disputes about certain entitlements under the Bill in general are referable to a rights commissioner with a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Issues arising in relation to, in particular, (i) whether the person in respect of whose care the leave is taken is a relevant person for the purposes of the Bill; and (ii) whether an employee is providing the full-time care and attention as required by the Bill, are to be decided by a deciding officer of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, who also carries out the assessments regarding relevant persons under the parallel carer's benefit scheme. This is a right <Col N="51" /> to appeal a decision of a deciding officer under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1992, to an appeals officer. The decision of a deciding officer or a decision made on appeal from a decision of a deciding officer, given in writing, is to be taken as sufficient evidence of the fact of the decision.</P>
    <P>In practice, under the provision of this Bill, employees wishing to avail of carer's leave will be required to notify their employer six weeks before they intend to take the leave and produce evidence as soon as possible from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that the relevant person, that is, the person for whose care the leave is being taken, is in need of full-time care and attention. Applicants for carer's leave can then use an acknowledgement of receipt of their application from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, when they first approach their employer in regard to seeking carer's leave, not later than six weeks before their proposed commencement of the leave. This acknowledgement from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will constitute evidence for employers of the bona fides of the application by the employee for carer's leave. It will also ensure that applicants do not have to get two medical assessments carried out for carer's benefit and or carer's leave.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has indicated that the medical assessment and the issue of the acknowledgement of application will be dealt with as soon as possible. In general, the turn-around in processing time will be within one to two weeks. Two weeks before commencing carer's leave applicants will be required to confirm their intentions to their employer.</P>
    <P>To Deputies who may fear that persons not meeting the carer's benefit criteria may be excluded from eligibility for carer's leave, I stress this will not be the case. Between the two Departments, we want to make the process as user friendly as possible. We do not want a situation whereby a relevant person will have to undergo two medical assessments, that is, one for carer's benefit and one for carer's leave. To that end, the medical assessment form has been designed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in such a way that it not only covers applications for carer's benefit but carer's benefit and or carer's leave as required. It should be noted particularly that failure to qualify for carer's benefit by not having the necessary PRSI contributions will not necessarily mean that an employee cannot avail of carer's leave. In such circumstances, the employee can be facilitated at his or her own expense with such leave provided the other requirements are met in relation to relevant persons and full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>While Deputies may also be concerned that such a procedure may delay approval of carer's leave, in fairness to all carers, it would be wrong to ask them to go through the medical procedures <Col N="52" /> of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the one hand for carer's benefit and through their local GP for carer's leave. Therefore, it is better all round that the application and certification procedures for both schemes be aligned as much as possible. Accordingly, the above arrangement will be the most effective for everyone involved, but especially for the most important person in all this, the person receiving the care who will not be required to undergo two medical assessments.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that any disputes in relation to the medical assessment and the provision of full-time care will be dealt with only by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Disputes in relation to employees' employment rights, for example, length of continuous service, return to work and redundancy situations, will be dealt with by a rights commissioner in the first instance and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, on appeal, as appropriate. This is similar to redress mechanisms set out in other employment rights legislation such as the Maternity Leave Act, 1994, the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, and the Parental Leave Act, 1998. All these have worked well and I have no doubt that they will also work effectively for carer's leave in the future. This Bill, with the exception of the medical assessment procedures outlined about, is very much modelled on the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the main features of the Bill. Sections 1 to 3 are standard provisions dealing with the short title. Section 4 ensures that persons cannot contract to nullify or exclude the application of the provisions of the Bill, but it allows for the provision of arrangements between an employer and an employee that are more favourable than those provided for in the Bill. Section 5 is a standard provision, which states that the cost of administering the Bill incurred by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 6 defines the qualifying conditions for entitlement to carer's leave. An employee is entitled to carer's leave, without pay, of 65 weeks in respect of any relevant persons, the other elements of which I have mentioned. Section 7 requires an employee to notify his or her employer of any change of circumstances that affects his or her entitlement to carer's leave. The section also provides that an employee may avail of leave in relation to the care of a second relevant person, while already on leave in relation to a relevant person, where the two relevant persons concerned are residing together. The period of leave in relation to the second relevant person shall commence on the date on which the deciding officer of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs notifies the employee that that person is a relevant person.</P>
    <P>Section 8 specifies that carer's leave, in respect of any one relevant person, may be taken in one continuous period of 65 weeks or in a number of periods, the aggregate duration of which does not <Col N="53" /> exceed 65 weeks. An employer may peremptorily refuse to grant carer's leave for any period of less than 13 weeks. There must be a gap of at least six weeks between periods of carer's leave taken by an employee in respect of a particular relevant person. That is a practical measure agreed by both sides, employers and employees' representatives.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that an employee who has taken carer's leave in respect of a relevant person cannot commence a period of carer's leave in respect of another relevant person until a period of 12 months has elapsed from the date on which leave in relation to the first relevant person terminated.</P>
    <P>As we are approaching 1.30 p.m., and there is a good deal of technical material in the remainder of my speech, with the permission of the House, may the remainder of my speech be reported in the Official Report? Is that allowed?</P>

      <P>Sections 9 and 10 regulate the procedures to be followed by an employee in giving notice of intention to avail of his or her entitlement to carer's leave. At least six weeks prior notice in writing is required from the employee, except where not reasonably practicable, in which case notice must be given as soon as is reasonably practicable.</P>
      <P>The terms of the leave then constitute a document to be known as a &ldquo;confirmation document&rdquo;. This document must be prepared and signed by the employer and employee not less than two weeks before the date on which the leave, as stated therein, is due to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employee may revoke the notice of his or her intention to take carer's leave, by notice in writing given to the employer, before the date of the confirmation document. An employee must <Col N="54" /> give at least four weeks' prior notice in writing to his or her employer of the intention to return to his or her employment on the expiration of the period of carer's leave. Section 11 sets out the circumstances and conditions upon which carer's leave terminates. Generally, the leave terminates on the date specified in the confirmation document. However, the leave may terminate on another date specified in an agreement between the employer and employee concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The only item of new legislation I will be initiating this year on the legislative programme for my Department for 2001 is the Bill to establish an Office for Economic and Social Development. Drafting of this Bill is proceeding. Deputies will be aware that, arising from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is also intended to locate the National Centre for Partnership and Performance within the proposed office alongside the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
      <P>This has necessitated a considerable degree of discussion with the social partners and at Government level before the necessary amendments could be sent to the parliamentary counsel for incorporation into the Bill. The revised text of the Bill is currently being examined by my Department and contact with the drafting office is continuing. I still expect that the Bill will be published during 2001, probably in the latter part of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the legislation will only be published by the end of the year, it is unlikely that it will be enacted in 2001. When does the Taoiseach consider the new structure will be in operation and the executive chairperson appointed? Does he envisage an interim arrangement whereby the presumption would be that the three bodies would be brought together, accommodation <Col N="55" /> would be found for them and that, on an interim basis, for which there is practice and precedent, the executive chairperson would be appointed? In such circumstances, the operation could commence in anticipation of the legislation being enacted. I understand matters are well advanced in that respect and perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate his intentions in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct that matters are well advanced. I hope to shorten the timescale for the legislation, but I am advised that is the expectation at present. However, aside from the legislation, it should be possible to go ahead and appoint the executive chairperson and interview for the key remaining member of staff and the other small number of staff. It should be possible to proceed with the three bodies, the office and the administrative arrangements. There is agreement between NESC, NESF and the NCPP in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the resource side, management has made recommendations on the scope for sharing administrative support services by NESC and NESF, who will be working side by side in the same building. There should be no unnecessary delay or duplication in the support areas. I hope it will be possible to appoint the chairperson next week. It is my intention to move ahead quickly after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What other legislation is being examined in his Department that may be published during this or the next session? What is being worked on in his Department? How many people in his Department form the legislation group? What role does his Department have in the ongoing preparation of the legislation for Campus Ireland? The Taoiseach led that issue but, when it began to run into deep water and face criticism, he gave a dirty pass to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. What liaison is ongoing in his Department? Are people in his Department working with officials in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on that legislation?</P>

      <P>It is a good Bill which will modernise the legislative basis we discussed yesterday, in addition to the Bill relating to statute law restatement.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, the initial work to get things up and running has progressed. The German architects who did the overall design are due to report shortly. The legislation will be drafted and the first phase of the work on the aquatic centre, which the Deputy strongly supports, is already under way. The contracts have been signed and that work will be carried on by the Minister, Deputy McDaid, with my full support, vocal and otherwise.</P>

      <P>How much of the work on the project is dependent on the legislation, which is not promised until later in the year?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will underpin the structure and put it on a legislative footing. It would be wrong to leave it on an <i>ad hoc</i> footing. Campus Ireland will be in existence for the next 100 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question which I have just answered, NESC, NESF and NCPP have been in existence for many years. They have no <Col N="57" /> legislative base even though they have been in existence for 20 or 30 years. They all have played an enormous role in Irish life and it is only now, after all these decades, that we are bringing them together to underpin them with legislation in the same way as with Campus Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To turn to the first question, the one to which the Taoiseach just referred, my understanding from his reply to me is that there will be interim arrangements, that the executive chairperson will be appointed fairly soon and will assume his or her responsibilities which at this stage are envisaged and set out in draft form in the legislation. When will all that become known and what will be the operational changes, if any, affecting the affairs of the three bodies to which he referred &ndash; NESF, NESC and the national centre for partnership? Will they be located in one place or is he in a position to tell me now about these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be located in one place. The CMOD, the management organising section, has already examined the knitting of the three together from an administrative point of view. They will be able to share accommodation and services. Both NESC and NESF are working side by side in the same building at present. Now they will be added to on this site.</P>
      <P>As far as their overall structures are concerned, NESC will continue to provide the same strategic analysis through its reports which it has been providing for many years and it will continue to develop the national framework which will be used for discussions on many national issues and national programmes in the future.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum will continue its focus with the Members of the Oireachtas and the social partners on monitoring initiatives taken in the context of social partnership, especially regarding social exclusion, the marginalised and the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership and Performance will take its initial brief from what was agreed and decided from two areas: first, from what was agreed and negotiated as part of the Programme for Partnership and Fairness; and second, the major study done on partnership, mainly, but not exclusively, arising out of what happened in the NCPP for the past number of years. As Deputy Quinn will recall, as he knows this area well, the NCPP was working on taking best practices and trying to build a model which would be useful for developing social partnership, but much of it has moved on over the past ten years or so. Through deliberation, consensus building, dissemination of information and monitoring, they hope to build, more aggressively, on the partnership groups in the public service and the many such groups which have been set up in <Col N="58" /> the private sector, and to tackle the new issues and the new difficulties there, but to move on the programme rather than just analysing and gathering information.</P>
    <P>If we can, as I believe we will, we will recruit people who have the ability to take this on. The legislative base is not important in that regard but it is important for many other reasons. With the three bodies working side by side, this could potentially give a whole new focus to what we have all been trying to do for the past decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the personnel currently involved in the national centre for partnership will be retained and will be part of the new structure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because they were on a contract which expired last autumn. It was open to them to reapply. Frankly I am not sure if they did. Perhaps they did. Their three-year contracts were up. At least some could potentially be new people and some of them might be from the existing staff who have been there for the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach says about putting the three organisations on a statutory basis with legislation, but can he tell me if the functions of NESC, NESF and NCPP will radically change in any way? Will the funding of those organisations change in the light of the legislation? Will the Government be following more closely the recommendations of the NESC after this legislative change? Is the legislation based, for example, on the Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice document, published by NESC last year, which discouraged any moves to reduce the top rate of tax, for example? Regarding such recommendations, is the Government to pay more attention to NESC following the enactment of this legislation or will there be any other real change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of NESC and NESF will not change. The Government, like successive previous Governments, will continue to take account of their work to provide a broad national framework, which has come directly from NESC. Increasingly the same is the case with NESF. Most of the current concentration across a broad spectrum of Departments, areas and Votes on the disadvantaged, the marginalised and the less well off in society are coming from NESC proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership and Performance is different. It is changing its remit. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance was put in place for a three-year experimental period but that has now moved on through the examination which has been done on the partnership report by all the social partners and by Departments and others, that is, the people involved in the partnership groups who are the staff of the Civil Service, the public service and <Col N="59" /> the private sector, some of whom are within the trades unions but most of whom are not.</P>
    <P>The three bodies have separate remits but they all are in the area of trying to produce and develop partnership programmes in order that the country continues to develop in a sustainable way for the betterment of all into the future. The National Economic and Social Council and NESF will not change their remit but NCPP will change dramatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of clarification, will the Government still be free, following the legislation, to ignore key recommendations from NESF? It is simply an advisory body. There is no obligation to have those recommendations implemented. Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council puts forward views and NESF monitors views and of course the Government and others are there to make the decisions, but by and large the major reports of NESC in the past 15 years, since its first document on which Congress built the jobs crisis document of the autumn 1996, have all been accepted and developed successfully.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships met 11 times during the year 2000. The last meeting took place on 14 December 2000 and the next meeting has been scheduled for this evening.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and PPPs is an integral part of Government and its meetings, as with any Cabinet committee, are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of work is being done on all <Col N="60" /> aspects of the infrastructure agenda. Questions on particular aspects should be put down to the relevant Minister.</P>

How many officials are engaged full-time in co-ordinating the work of this sub-committee, which has met 11 times in the last calendar year and whose expenditure over the seven years, including last year, including that on PPPs, is of the order of £48 billion? Are they all full-time staff? What additional work was done by them on the 356 days the Cabinet sub-committee did not meet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people on the economic side in my Department spend a great deal of time co-ordinating work with the relevant Departments and agencies. Most of the key Ministers, such as the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government, are on the sub-committee and other Ministers are involved as issues arise, along with all the senior staff in the key Departments. We also link in with the agencies, especially the National Roads Authority, CIE in all its aspects, the ESB, Bord Gáis and any other semi-State bodies where infrastructural matters are ongoing. A large number of civil servants and staff spend a great deal of their time working on the infrastructural committee. The monitoring section for the national development plan is located in the Department of Finance. I am unsure as to the number of staff involved but a number work full-time on it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the framework for action on infrastructural development, including public-private partnerships, which was prepared for the Cabinet sub-committee more than a year ago, particular emphasis is laid on addressing bottlenecks and constraints, including capacity, skills and institutional barriers, where the national development plan is concerned. As the person with overall responsibility for the Cabinet sub-committee, does the Taoiseach find <Col N="61" /> it incredible that, only a month ago, two Departments showed absolute ineptitude in overcoming institutional barriers when 19 workers were led in shackles from Dublin Airport to prison although they came here with a licence to be immigrant workers? Is the Taoiseach confident that such outrages will not happen again and that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will finally clear the lines so they are going in the same direction?</P>
      <P>In the context of the emphasis laid by the Cabinet sub-committee on public-private partnerships in electricity supply and other projects, does the Taoiseach agree the one major example of a public-private partnership, the bridge over the Liffey at the M50, is not a model or an encouragement to people to have hope or to look with confidence towards the idea of public-private partnerships because it is the major obstacle to traffic in north Dublin, with traffic stretching from the Liffey back to Finglas on an afternoon as workers try to go home?</P>

      <P>On the broader question the Deputy raised, to develop a seven year plan such as this and to expend the money efficiently requires a substantial number of public-private partnership projects. I hope that, when the bridge to which the Deputy referred is doubled in size, it will help and will link in with the enormous amount of construction work taking place across the M50. The motorway from Firhouse will open in a few months, construction of the south-eastern motorway will commence shortly and the airport bypass to Lissenhall is already under construction. I accept the bridge referred to creates tailbacks but there is a plan to double its size. There is a need to have public-private partnerships involved in these types of construction projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a high degree of scepticism and no confidence among IBEC and other business organisations and people in general that the Government can deliver on the public-private partnership concept to fulfil the objectives in the national development plan? Does the Taoiseach accept it is the secrecy of the Cabinet sub-committee on infra<Col N="62" /> structure which leads to this scepticism? Will he examine structures whereby he could answer questions in the House to show what work is being done? This scepticism exists and nothing the Taoiseach has said removes my concern that the Government is not delivering on the public-private partnership projects.</P>

Financial institutions and others say they need and have more interest in large rather than small projects. The eastern bypass is a £1 billion project and I look forward to their positive response to taking up that large project. We will see how that progresses, and a number of other projects have been taken up in Waterford and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>That has already happened in the Planning and Development Act. For example, one year ago the Waterford road project involved 11 separate contracts which have now been reduced to two as a result of the new CPO procedure in the negotiation of contracts. As a consequence, the project will be completed by 2007, instead of 2017 or 2018 as originally envisaged. The same applies to the Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast projects which have been allowed to move apace because of the new streamlined procedure in the Planning and Development Act which is working well so far.

Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be logical to debate and agree such a spatial plan first in the light of the fact that it should form the basis of the development of the national development plan in terms of the allocation of resources and the policies which should determine where populations should be developed, etc? What has the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure done in this regard? Has a final decision been made on a national spatial plan and, if so, when will it be brought forward?</P>

Has the Taoiseach looked at the submission from the IFA in which it seeks to address the matter in a fair way?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met and received the proposals of the IFA on the issue which presents a very big problem in certain areas. It all comes down to compensation and how the issue is hand<Col N="66" /> led in terms of the value of the land in question and the speed with which payment can be made. From the Government's point of view, the best course of action is to try to reach a clear understanding with the IFA on a procedure which would be applicable throughout the country as, otherwise, time will be lost. While there are some delays in the implementation of the national development plan, they are not occurring on the road plans side. Last year, about 96% of the NDP infrastructure funds allocated was drawn down. If there is a reluctance, as there is, on the part of some IFA members, we could run into great difficulties on some of the major projects. It is in the interests of the Government, therefore, to come to an understanding on a proper and fair, but simple procedure for land acquisition acceptable both to landowners and the State.</P>

      <P>The position has improved dramatically. The NRA in the early part of last <Col N="67" /> year was given the go-ahead to recruit new project teams and senior engineering staff. The authority has recruited the necessary senior staff for all its teams since Christmas. As the Deputy will be aware, there has been an extensive, successful international campaign to attract large contractors to take up recent major contracts. An enormous number of the largest contractors in Europe have specified an interest. It has improved to a point, which we discussed previously on Question Time, where there seems to be a figure below which people will not go to tender. If the project is valued at more than £100 million, there is not a problem but if it is under that figure, there is. It is quite clear where the line is drawn by the major contractors.</P>

The responsibility for certifying files for retention is vested by section 8(4) of the Act in officers of the Department authorised for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>I am informed that 555 records from this Department were released for public inspection at the end of 2000 and 12 files were retained. The figure does not include a small number of instances where, under section 8(4) of the Act, original documents were removed and replaced with photocopies from which names and personal information have been extracted or where documents were removed completely. I am advised that in all cases of removal or substitution of documents, an indication to that effect is added to the relevant files.</P>

    <P>In accordance with the National Archives Act, 1986, and Regulations, 1988, schedules of files for retention are sent to the director of the National <Col N="68" /> Archives each year. Neither the Act nor the regulations envisage the publication of those schedules.</P>

If there is a Nobel prize for that class of literature, Sir, we have found a new winner. I return to the content of the reply, in so far as I can deconstruct it from its opacity. Under section 8 of the National Archives Act, 1998, there are three reasons files can be retained. A total of 12 files have been retained, presumably within the operation of the Act on the basis that their release would be either contrary to the public interest, it would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence or they might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals or would or might be likely to lead to the action for damages or defamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have instigated an independent review of this case. It requires and deserves a specific response because of the very serious consequences which arose from the granting of temporary release in this case and the very understandable level of public concern it has generated. For that reason, in December last, I decided to have all aspects of the handling of the case reviewed.</P>
      <P>The review is being undertaken by Mr. John Olden, the retired former Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta, who has practical prior experience of Irish prisons administration and is a senior serving member of the Council of Europe committee for the prevention of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment of persons in custody. I am informed that Mr. Olden's review is well under way but that he is not in a position to say when it will be finalised. Given the seriousness of the matter Mr. Olden should be given adequate time to examine all aspects of the case.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the review by Mr. Olden are as follows: in light of the offender's conviction on 5 December 2000 for a second murder committed on 14 February while on temporary release from Castlerea Prison &ndash; (i) to review and report on the management of his sentences up to that time; (ii) specifically to report on the procedures followed and their adequacy leading to granting-revocation of periods of temporary release to this prisoner; and (iii) to make any observations and recommendations considered appropriate.</P>
      <P>I propose to make the results of Mr. Olden's review available to the House and to the family of the victim. I will consider carefully any recommendations emerging from the review. Until Mr. Olden's review is completed, it would not be appropriate to comment further on the detailed management of this case.</P>
      <P>However, I again remind the House that temporary release or parole is a feature of prison systems world wide and is an important vehicle for re-integrating into the community in a planned and controlled way, offenders often including those serving life sentences for murder. There is, undoubtedly, a large element of risk in this which requires careful consideration and the paramount concern is the safety of the public. If we were to adopt an entirely risk free approach to the management of life sentences, then no life sentenced prisoner would ever be released and such an approach would neither be right, in terms of effective sentence management, nor would it find favour with most Members in this House.</P>

      <P>I once again extend my deepest sympathy and that of the Government to the family of the deceased. This was an appalling outrage. I have asked Mr. Olden for a comprehensive review. I understand it is well under way and I sincerely hope it will be available at an early date. I cannot for obvious reasons state when precisely the review will be published but it will be published the moment it comes to hand.</P>
      <P>Once the review is to hand, with the recommendations which no doubt Mr. Olden will put forward, it is my intention to examine the recommendations, have a debate on them and implement them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the greatest care is taken to ensure there will not be a repetition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the greatest care will be taken to avoid a repetition. Is he aware of any other instances that have occurred since the death of Nancy Nolan in which someone, who was convicted of causing the death of another person, when on temporary release behaved in a manner which resulted in the possibility of further prosecutions being brought against him or her? What view is taken of situations where a person misbehaves on temporary release and appears by his or her conduct to pose a threat to third parties? Does it result in temporary release being immediately terminated? What reporting mechanisms exist to ensure there is co-ordination between the Garda, to whom allegations might be made about the behaviour of persons on temporary release, the prison authorities and the Department to ensure that persons who misbehave when on temporary release are not given the benefit of temporary release again for a considerable period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who is granted temporary release and who has served a lengthy sentence, having been convicted of murder, for example, would be on a structured temporary release programme. A person on temporary release is bound to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Since the person concerned is still under the remit of the criminal justice system and its authorities, further conditions might be applied. A condition might be inserted to the effect, for example, that the person may not live in a certain locality, perhaps where the victim's family resides. Other such conditions are regularly attached to temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I am not aware of a person who committed a murder and was convicted a second time for another murder other than the person in this case. When people are granted temporary release, there is always an element of risk. Cases such as this, where a person is serving seven years or more, are examined by a sentence review group. The group comprises a panel of experts who make a recommendation to the Minister. Normally, the Minister of the day would go along with the recommendation because it would have gone through a lengthy and considered process. The difficulty with temporary release, even in a structured form, is that there is always an element of risk involved. In the vast majority of cases, however, there have not been difficulties and I am not aware of any other case of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this matter in some detail on a number of occasions in this House. I have at all times given as much information as possible and welcome this opportunity to update the House.</P>
      <P>I am constrained by a number of factors and I ask Deputies to be equally mindful of those factors. This is a complex matter and a number of issues have yet to be resolved. A number of civil actions have been initiated, the Director of Public Prosecutions is examining the question of criminal proceedings in a number of cases, complaints have been lodged with the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the question of possible disciplinary action against members of the Garda Síochána may have to be considered by the Commissioner. All these factors place an onus on us to be careful in what we say about the matter in hand. It is essential that the truth is determined and that, in this process, the rights of all concerned are upheld and vindicated. We must be careful not to prejudice any proceedings which may arise from the matter in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked what steps have been taken since I received the report of a senior Garda officer into allegations of corruption and malpractice involving members of the Garda in County Donegal. On completion of the investigation by the Assistant Commissioner, a file in <Col N="72" /> the matter was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The directions of the director are awaited. Deputies will be aware that the question of criminal prosecutions is a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions and I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have no role in the prosecution of individuals for criminal offences. It would be totally inappropriate for me to make any comment in this regard and, accordingly, I do not propose to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition to the investigation carried out by Assistant Commissioner Carthy, two other investigations relating to Donegal were initiated. One, conducted by Assistant Commissioner Murphy, relates to matters raised by the then Opposition spokesmen on justice and the other investigation, conducted by a chief superintendent, relates to a matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation. The results of these investigations are still awaited.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked if I will bring the report before an Oireachtas committee and if I will establish a sworn inquiry into the allegations. I want to see the truth determined. I also want to see public confidence in the Garda restored, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter. The question is how we can best achieve this in an open and transparent way.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might have been implicated in wrongdoing. It is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members is investigated thoroughly and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated. I have indicated the position in these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Commissioner has already taken initial steps to address the question of public confidence in policing in Donegal by the transfer of a number of personnel. In this the Commissioner has my full support. While it is the case, therefore, that various steps have been and are being taken to deal with different aspects of this matter &ndash; and it is also the case that these inquiries and so on must be allowed to run their course &ndash; I can understand the point that the completion of individual inquiries could still leave a concern that the bigger picture has not been addressed or that it has not been addressed in a way that deals with the issue of public confidence.</P>
    <P>The nature of the Donegal case is such that it requires some form of comprehensive review that will examine and report on all aspects of the matter. Deputies will be aware from previous statements I have made in the House that I accept the current arrangements for dealing with complaints against the Garda Síochána are not satisfactory and need to be revised. I have also indicated that I intend to bring forward appropriate proposals to Government to amend the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986. In that context I am <Col N="73" /> looking at the possible establishment of new processes which would not only deal with complaints against individual members but would address wider issues of the type raised by the case in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring to Government in the near future proposals for amendments to the existing Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act and suggestions to deal with wider issues of the kind to which I have already referred. When the Government has considered the matter, I will make a further statement. I cannot say, at this stage, whether a public sworn inquiry by way of a tribunal would represent the best way of addressing what I have described as the &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo; issues in this case. It is an option which I have not ruled out, but neither am I convinced that it would necessarily be the best way of dealing with the matter. At this stage, I have an open mind on the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions has publicly stated that no prosecutions will ensue on foot of the investigations into Garda activity involving the McBrearty family in Donegal? A report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 2 January this year indicated that the Minister is reported to be preparing an initiative to bring to Government to establish a sworn inquiry into allegations of Garda corruption in Donegal. What is the status of that report? What preparations, if any, has the Minister made in that regard?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is an onus on him to ensure absolute confidence in the operations of An Garda Síochána? An inordinate amount of time has passed since the completion of this report and the report itself took almost two years. When can we expect the other two reports by the chief superintendent and Assistant Commissioner Murphy, neither of which one would have expected to have taken so long to complete? Has the Minister been in touch with any of the individuals concerned and has he expressed any concern about the inordinate amount of time that has passed which undermines public confidence in policing?</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin raised a number of issues. I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner about the other two reports. I understand at least one of the reports will be with me shortly and the other is well advanced. The main report, which is in the possession of the Director of Public Prosecutions for decision, is one which I would be unwise to publish in the absence of a decision being made by the director in relation to what prosecutions, if any, he will take. The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his role. I may not interfere with him and I do not have any role in his decision making process. In those circumstances, I cannot seek to expedite his decision either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree it is my function to ensure that the full<Col N="74" /> est confidence is reposed in the Garda Síochána by the public. In that respect, the Garda Commissioner has transferred some members of the force. I appreciate that this would not appear sufficient on a cursory reading of what appears to have taken place. Again, however, I cannot prejudge any of these matters until the Director of Public Prosecutions makes his decision. Even then, it would be a matter for the courts if there are prosecutions.</P>

      <P>In the course of a reply delivered on my behalf during the Adjournment Debate on 13 December last on this matter, I stated that the Government would adopt a flexible approach in accommodating the views of individuals and various relevant groups in the NGO sector who had expressed concern at the original appointment offers made by the Government to the eight positions on the Human Rights Commission. The position in that regard had already been set out by me in a reply to a question from Deputy Shatter on 6 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its meeting on 19 December 2000, the Government agreed to my proposals to enhance the range of interests to be represented on the commission through the creation of six additional positions and I was authorised to offer appoint<Col N="75" /> ments to six persons drawn from the original list submitted by the selection committee, chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker. Those persons are: Ms Nuala Kelly who has a background in the NGO and prisoners' rights area; Ms Clodach McGrory &ndash; a Northern Ireland barrister; Ms Katherine Zappone &ndash; a social policy research consultant; Mr. Martin Collins who is involved in Travellers' rights and race equality issues; Mr. Micheal Farrell &ndash; a solicitor; and Mr. Gerard Quinn &ndash; a law professor.</P>
    <P>The position now is that of the 14 persons whom the Government wishes to appoint to the commission, ten have been drawn from the selection committee's list of 16 candidates and six of those ten are from the committee's preferred list of eight candidates. The remaining four appointees, namely, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, Mr. William Binchy, Ms Olive Braiden and Mr. Tom O'Higgins, had all applied for the positions as advertised and were considered by the selection committee. Some names were leaked to a newspaper and no adverse implication should be drawn in regard to the people who were not selected for the commission. All of the people in question were eminently suitable but there simply was not sufficient room for everyone.</P>
    <P>My main priority now is to ensure that the commission begins its work as quickly as possible. The Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, will need slight amendment, principally to cover the increase in membership, and I hope to include the necessary changes in the forthcoming Bill to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>However, there is no impediment to the commission meeting as an interim body in the meantime. There is much valuable work it can do straight away and as soon as I have received all formal notifications of acceptance of appointment, I shall be in contact with the president of the commission in that regard. I know that he, too, is keen to get things moving. At that stage, I will then be in a position to regard the whole selection process as finalised, and reply at last individually to the many applicants who applied to be considered for these appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the procedure and approach he adopted to the appointment of members to the Human Rights Commission was a total shambles? Will he explain why, having rejected the names of the six additional people he is now proposing to appoint to the commission, he turned around and decided to appoint them? Will he explain why, having ignored the priority recommendations of the Whitaker committee, he is now seeking to implement them with the exclusion of one person? Will he explain why he is now proposing to appoint an additional six members to the commission in circumstances in which the legislation <Col N="76" /> he enacted delimited numbers to prevent that? Will he clarify whether the members he wishes to appoint, together with those he has already appointed, have yet met and when the commission is expected to get up and running?</P>

      <P>A selection committee was established in order to draw up a list of names but it was always understood that the Government, acting in its sovereign capacity, would decide who would be on the commission in accordance with the legislation which provides that the commission must broadly reflect society. The Government originally appointed eight people to the commission in addition to the president. I subsequently attended a conference in Dublin Castle at which it became very clear to me that people from the NGOs were very annoyed. In the course of a speech I delivered on that occasion, I stated that it was not a case of &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; and that I would consider whether change was required. I informed the conference delegates that I wanted the commission to start out well and to be strong and successful. It seemed to me that the best approach was to try to ensure that the very real concerns people expressed were addressed and I did that in an open, transparent and magnanimous manner. There is no point in having a commission which was strangled at birth.</P>

      <P>At least one of the subsequent appointees acknowledged that the commission is actually stronger for having undergone these difficulties. The commission has not yet met because the legislation must be amended to provide for an increase in the number of people on the commission. However, I intend, once all of the appointees have notified their acceptance of their appointments, to commence the commission on an interim basis. I look forward to that happening at a very early date under the chairmanship of the learned Mr. Justice Barrington. It is vitally important that the commission be inclusive.</P>

Will he further explain whether he has met these people and what difficulties they have brought to his attention? When will the Minister introduce the new legislation required to enable the expanded commission to meet? Does he accept this would only require a very short Bill which could be drafted in 20 minutes by a competent person?

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an interview undertaken by a retired senior member of An Garda Síochána in which he alleged that there is a serial killer on the loose who is responsible for a number of unsolved murders; if he has consulted with the Garda Commissioner concerning the nature of the investigation being undertaken to identify and prosecute the alleged serial killer for offences allegedly committed by him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the wide-ranging interview to which the Deputy refers, in which an individual expressed views about a number of yet unsolved cases and which also involved discussion on whether a serial killer was responsible for the disappearance of a number of missing women. As I have previously informed the House, Operation Trace was established by the Garda Commissioner for the specific purpose of <Col N="78" /> establishing whether any common denominator linked any of six women who went missing in the Leinster area between 1993 and 1998. I am sure the House will appreciate that the manner in which these women disappeared creates particular difficulties for the investigating gardaí. As there is no crime scene, criminal profiling is not possible and analysis based on crime scene examination and pathological evidence is not available. Furthermore, I understand that victim profiling has not established any link between the cases.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as yet, no discernible pattern has emerged which would support the theory that a serial killer could have been involved in all of these disappearances. Each of the cases currently under review by Operation Trace was originally investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance. I understand all information and leads relating to any of these separate cases is systematically and vigorously pursued and that Operation Trace has comprehensively reviewed the cases of six missing women and has yielded new lines of inquiries that have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. Furthermore, a unique database has been devised which facilitates cross referencing of detail and highlighting of similarities between cases.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The Garda authorities assure me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result of this, substantial changes were made in 1998 such as the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a liaison officer, who deals with a designated family member.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there are lines of inquiry ongoing in these cases. Many searches have been conducted and further searches will be based on the available information and intelligence.</P>
      <P>While I wish the former member of the force in question well in his retirement, I am informed by the Garda authorities that he was not involved in any of the original inquiries into these cases nor in Operation Trace. In the circumstances his comments amount to no more than speculation for which those involved in the investigation have no evidence. The speculation, however well intentioned, is not fair to the families involved who have suffered greatly.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that he has full confidence in the existing Operation Trace and as with all Garda operations, Operation Trace is under continuous review to ensure that it is effective in achieving its purpose.</P>

      <P>When was the unique database, as the Minister describes it, established? Would he acknowledge that it is a matter of serious public concern that a senior, retired member of the Garda Síochána should allege that there is a serial killer on the loose? At what stage was it con<Col N="79" /> sidered that the disappearance of the women concerned could be linked and that there was a possibility that they could have been murdered by the same person?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether he has had a meeting with the Garda Commissioner about this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this with the Garda Commissioner on a number of occasions. With all due respect to the inspector who made the statement about a serial killer, he was not involved at any point in Operation Trace nor was he involved in any of the investigations in relation to the women concerned.</P>
      <P>The absence of criminal profiling means there is no scene and, when there is no scene, it makes things difficult, to say the least. There is no discernible pattern which has become apparent to the Garda Síochána following investigation, which would suggest or establish that there is a serial killer on the loose. That is not a possibility one could exclude but there has been nothing to suggest it to date. The reason there has not been a profile is that a body has not been found at a scene which would assist in the investigation.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána is investigating these matters still. None of the files have been closed.</P>

      <P>The Government has a policy on decentralisation. So far, decentralisation to Waterford has taken place very successfully. It is possible, even probable, that the remainder of the Land Registry would be transferred to Waterford. Such a decision has not yet been taken. In those circumstances no decisions have been reversed.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the on-going delays experienced with the Land Registry, the huge and ever-escalating backlog requires that steps be taken to implement the Government decision made some time ago to transfer the Land Registry to a semi-State body or that the Government make other decisions to improve the efficiency of the Land Registry?</P>
      <P>What consideration has the Minister given to proposals received by him from the Law Society in this regard? By what date will the legislation he promises be published, as it was originally promised to be published during the course of 2000? As the Land Registry remains, for the time being, a State body, what action is he taking to ensure it provides a more efficient service than the service currently available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the service should be more efficient. I have obtained permission from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to increase the number of staff in the Land Registry. The recruitment process is under way.</P>
      <P>The number of transactions in the Land Registry has increased dramatically in recent years because of the improved economy and consultations are taking place with the Law Society on the formation of the Land Registry as a semi-State commercial body. These negotiations are on-going and the Law Society is apprised of precisely what is going on. I expect to publish the legislation later this year.</P>

      <P>Is it not logical that this organisation should be broken up and located in regions <Col N="81" /> where people and personnel would have much easier access to it? Let an office in Waterford cover that area, but let us have an office in an area such as Monaghan to cover the north east and the northern area.</P>
      <P>This issue is causing severe problems and headaches for people in all sorts of property options, particularly those applying for EU pensions and things like that, where a great deal of documentation must be trawled and the trauma those families suffer is unacceptable. Can the Minister consider breaking the country into areas and servicing it from regional offices rather than from centralised offices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The main or, at least, most immediate problem with delays in the Land Registry relates to what Deputy Crawford has mentioned, that is to say, people seeking certified copies of folios and Land Registry maps. For that reason the issue of those documents has been prioritised within the Land Registry so that we can try to deal with these matters expeditiously.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, and I will check the position in Monaghan for the Deputy and communicate with him, the copy folios would be available in the office of the County Registrar. I fully accept that the maps would have to be obtained at central level.</P>
      <P>With the increased computerisation of the Land Registry, which is on-going, the stage will soon be reached whereby solicitors in their offices will be able to conduct Land Registry searches of folios and look at maps on screens. That should resolve Deputy Crawford's problem.</P>
      <P>I have always argued that if modern technology was not to conquer the curse of what I will describe as &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo; then it had little use.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 32, 39, 64, 92 and 138 to 141, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from the replies I have given to previous questions in this House, and particularly my reply to Priority Question No. 86 on 15 November last year, Official Report, Vol. 526 Cols. 73 to 75, that I accept that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána are not satisfactory and need to be revised. In that context, I have also indicated that it is my intention to bring forward appropriate proposals to Government to amend the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial number of proposals have been advanced relating to reform of the Garda complaints machinery, including proposals made by the Garda Complaints Board in a series of reports it has presented to me. The relevant issues have raised important and complex concerns which have required the carrying out of a detailed review. That review is receiving priority attention <Col N="83" /> and it has almost been completed. As part of this exercise, I am looking at possible new arrangements which would not only cover complaints against individual members but also wider policing issues. A general review is being undertaken in relation to the management and structures of the Garda Síochána. While this exercise is not specifically concerned with Garda complaints, it is looking at a wide range of strategies with a view to improving the quality of the services delivered to the public by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Some questions are concerned with whether it is proposed to provide for a Garda ombudsman. I dealt with this topic in my reply on 15 November and I do not propose to repeat in full what I said in my earlier reply. However, I remind Deputies that, on that occasion, I referred to the particular circumstances in which it was found necessary to establish very specific confidence-building measures in relation to the police in Northern Ireland. In addition, I said I was not satisfied that similar arrangements would be either appropriate or beneficial in this jurisdiction. I have not altered my views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Another question refers to the introduction of an independent inspectorate for the Garda Síochána. The establishment of such a body is one of the options under examination as part of the review to which I have referred. In the circumstances, Deputies will appreciate that, at this stage, it would be premature for me to indicate a final view in relation to an inspectorate. However, it is an option I am considering very carefully. I expect to be in a position to finalise my proposals for changes to be made in the field of Garda complaints shortly. I will submit them to Government for approval as quickly as possible. When the Government has considered the matter I will make a further statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>By what date does the Minister expect to produce a substantive proposal to this House to address these issues? Does he acknowledge that the current system as operated by the Garda complaints tribunal is not working to the extent that gardaí who have had spurious complaints made against them can be under a cloud, not just for months but years, before the complaints are dealt with and ordinary citizens who make complaints, properly and validly, believe they are not taken seriously, treated with urgency or given priority? Does the Minister acknowledge that we need a new structure, in fairness both to the Garda Síochána and the public, to deal with complaints made against it? Will the Minister clarify why, if he has not yet made up his mind on the matter, he floated the idea a few weeks ago that he would put in place an independent inspectorate to deal with issues relating to the <Col N="84" /> gardaí that had given rise to complaint or which needed to be investigated? Will he indicate if he was flying a kite or has he any view on this issue? If he has a view, how does he envisage the independent inspectorate will operate? From where will it come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the changes identified in the course of my review, the current structures under which complaints against the Garda are dealt with do not need to be radically altered. This would mean, for example, that complaints against individual members would continue to be addressed by the Garda Complaints Board and that internal disciplinary matters would continue to remain the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. However, I recognise that there are situations outside the existing complaints machinery that require to be covered. What I have in mind is where specific Garda systems or operations do not measure up to the appropriate standards, for example, the difficulties which arose in County Donegal. I am looking closely at the question of an inspectorate. A new independent inspectorate with appropriate powers might be very well placed to conduct the necessary investigations in such cases. I am considering the measures that would be required to put that inspectorate in place. It is an important part of the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two distinct issues. The first relates to the review of the Garda complaints procedures. The Minister referred to his reply to the same question in November last year. He told the House then that the review of the operations of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act was nearing completion. He has now repeated that to the House. Will he give a definitive date by which that review will be completed? Will he publish its conclusions as soon as they come to hand?</P>
      <P>As regards the Garda ombudsman, which the Minister dismissed on the last occasion saying it was a matter relevant to Northern Ireland because of the unique situation there but not one relevant to us, has he had an opportunity to reflect further on that? In particular has he taken the opportunity to discuss this matter with Dr. Maurice Hayes, who was instrumental in drawing up the proposals for Northern Ireland and who, as a member of the Oireachtas, would be a very useful person with whom to discuss these matters and their application to this jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>What might be suitable in one jurisdiction might not be suitable in another. However, I accept it is of considerable importance that the investigating mechanism available in this jurisdiction should be every bit as effective <Col N="85" /> and efficient as any new system that might emerge in the North. I have not discussed the matter with the Senator but I would have no difficulty in doing so. I recognise the major contribution that Senator Hayes has made in this area and its quality. I have stated on a number of occasions that the Garda Complaints Board needs to be looked at and new mechanisms put in place. It is my intention to do that. I expect the report to be to hand very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that the Minister has decided the need for an independent Garda inspectorate derives from the ongoing investigations being conducted in Donegal and that he believes there is a need for legislation to give such an inspectorate statutory powers? Will the Minister tell the House, as matters now stand, if he is dissatisfied with the investigations being conducted into allegations of Garda misbehaviour in Donegal? Will he say whether he is concerned that some members of the Garda Síochána may not have fully co-operated with those investigations or does he believe that those responsible for the investigations have had the fullest possible co-operation? Is he now acknowledging that the Donegal allegations have rendered it an urgent priority that we put in place an independent inspectorate and, if so, will he clarify from where it is to come? Is it to be recruited from an outside police force or does he envisage recruiting separately for such inspectorate from the usual Garda recruitment process?</P>

      <P>I stated earlier that I have not ruled out the possibility of a public inquiry in relation to the Donegal situation which I gave as an example when I was outlining what a new inspectorate might investigate, so therefore I was not ruling out the other. I cannot state that I am dissatisfied with the investigations carried out in Donegal. It has to be remembered that the Garda Síochána are involved in criminal investigation and the Garda Commissioner is involved in internal disciplinary matters. In regard to whether given standards were adhered to in situations like Donegal, we are then into different territory and whether we should have a public inquiry or whether that should be examined by an inspectorate. The whole question of prosecutions, if any, arising out of Donegal are and must remain a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>My concern is about what appears to be the pedestrian pace of change in this matter. Will the Minister clarify who is dragging their feet in relation to change? As I understand it, there is a general agreement that change is necessary. Why is it not taking place? The Minister is in charge. Where lies this review report? Who has been holding it up? Is it a fact that a draft has been sent to the Minister and it may be held up in his own Department? What is <Col N="86" /> the situation? Will the Minister also outline the position on the latest annual report of the existing Garda Síochána Complaints Board? When was the last one published? When is the next one due? Is there a delay in that regard? Will the Minister explain why, if there is this notion of change, it is not taking place?</P>

We have had a view from the European committee on torture and inhumane and degrading treatment. We have had a view from the Garda Síochána and views have been expressed by others, including staff associations and so on. All these matters have to be given the most careful consideration.

There is another internal Garda investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption in south Dublin. First, are there any other internal investigations into allegations of wrongdoing currently under way in the Garda Síochána? Second, is the Minister satisfied with the conduct of those internal investigations? Third, the Minister is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 January as indicating that if progress can be made on establishing an independent inspectorate, it is possible that it could act as an investigating body into what went wrong with policing in this country?

      <P>Does the Minister accept that no concrete progress has been made in this area since the last Justice Question Time in the House in November, when we had a similar debate? We are hearing now the same answers we heard then. Does the Minister believe it is appropriate for members of the Garda Síochána to investigate their colleagues, even in cases of minor allegations? Does he believe that is appropriate when we have the responsibility to ensure that public confidence in the Garda Síochána is maximised? Does he believe it is fair to the members of the force concerned who are under investigation or who are doing the investigating that they are asked to undertake this work, which is basically examining the work of colleagues and, in many cases, friends of theirs? Will the Minister inform the House whether he has a timescale for concrete proposals on whether we will be talking about a review that is under way during the next Question Time when, no doubt, we will have the same debate again?</P>

      <P>In my own defence, there is no delay on my part. There may be a degree of impatience on Deputy Coveney's part but whether there is or not, due process must be allowed to take place in this jurisdiction at all times and no Minister for Justice must ever deviate from it, irrespective of what the public perception of himself or herself may be at any given time. I do not propose to depart from that precedent. I did mention that from a public perception perspective, there can be no question but that some people would obviously prefer people other than gardaí to investigate gardaí. That is why I have indicated that I am seriously examining the whole question of an inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the investigation of criminal <Col N="88" /> offences in the State, be it against the gardaí or anybody else, that is a matter reposed in the Garda. In that context, senior members of the Garda Síochána and, in particular, the Commissioner are as anxious as Deputy Coveney and I to ensure that this matter is brought to a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to questions on this matter on 15 November last, I indicated that, at that time, only those Garda stations which took part in the pilot trials of electronic recording had facilities for audio/video recording Garda interviews with detained persons. There are six such stations as follows: Tallaght, Bridewell in Cork, Bridewell in Dublin, Portlaoise, Henry Street, Limerick and Mill Street, Galway. Since then, similar facilities have been installed in the Garda College, Terenure, Drogheda, Sligo and Waterford. Additional equipment has also been provided to the Cork Bridewell.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that facilities for audio/video recording will be installed in approximately 150 Garda stations. In my reply of 15 November, I mentioned it was envisaged that 300 interview rooms would be refurbished for the new audio/video equipment. I now understand that, following a further assessment of their requirements by the Garda authorities, the actual number of rooms to be used for that purpose will be in the region of 220.</P>
      <P>Interview rooms in all the relevant stations will need to be refurbished and fitted out to facilitate the required audio/video equipment. Tenders were received last October for the supply of this specialised recording equipment. Completion of the evaluation of the tenders received, and placing a contract with a supplier, has been delayed due to problems encountered by the Garda authorities with equipment submitted by suppliers during the tender evaluation process. As a result, delivery and installation of the equipment in the remaining selected stations is expected to commence in April and be completed before the end of the year.</P>

How many stations will be fitted with audio-video recording facilities and what is the total number of rooms? In November the Minister indicated that 130 rooms would be <Col N="89" /> equipped by the end of March. How many have been equipped to date and will the target of 130 rooms set by him be reached by the end of March? How much has been expended to date &ndash; I asked for this figure the last day &ndash; on the provision of this equipment? Is it not the case that the complaint by the Attorney General that the Minister is foot-dragging on this issue is a reality?</P>

      <P>It is true that there was a delay. The Garda authorities encountered problems with equipment submitted by suppliers during the tender evaluation process. As a result, there were delays in fitting out the remaining rooms and stations. I have indicated where the stations are located.

I also recently announced my intention to establish a parole board on an administrative basis in the near future pending statutory provision in the prisons Bill.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that there would be advantage in allowing the non-statutory parole board to gain experience before putting it on a statutory basis and I can see merit in this. This may have the effect of separating out the provisions dealing with the parole board from the rest of the prisons Bill. This would have the double advantage of enabling the legislation dealing with the parole board to reflect the experience gained while allowing the prisons Bill to go ahead much earlier than would otherwise be possible. I am still reflecting on this suggestion but my inclination at present is to have two separate Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will complete the Minister of State's speech.</P>
      <P>Carer's leave terminates when the employee ceases to personally provide full-time care and attention for the relevant person in respect of whom the carer's leave was taken, for example, where another person begins to provide full-time care and attention to the relevant person. The leave shall also terminate when a deciding officer or an appeals officer of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs makes a decision, on reference by an employer, that the person being cared for is not a relevant person for the purposes of the Bill. Section 11 also provides that carer's leave shall continue for up to six weeks after the death of the relevant person, subject to the period of carer's leave in the confirmation document not having expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the postponement, curtailment and variation of the form in which carer's leave may be taken by agreement between the employee and employer concerned. The section also provides that where carer's leave is <Col N="92" /> postponed, curtailed or varied it may, subject to section 6, be taken at another time.</P>
    <P>Part 3 which deals with employment rights is a standard provision in employment rights legislation generally. Section 13 is concerned with the employment position of the employee during carer's leave. The main provisions are as follows. An employee on carer's leave will be treated as if he or she had not been absent from his or her employment so that all of his or her employment rights, except the right to remuneration, annual leave, public holidays in excess of the initial period of 13 weeks of carer's leave, superannuation benefits, etc., will be unaffected during the leave. A period of probation or apprenticeship may be suspended during carer's leave if the employer considers that its continuance would not be consistent with the carer's leave. Periods of carer's leave are not to be reckonable as any other type of leave, for example, sick leave, annual leave, adoptive leave, maternity leave, parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides entitlement to return to work on the expiration of a period of carer's leave. It also deals with arrangements for return to work where there has been a change of ownership of the enterprise concerned or the enterprise is temporarily closed on the date the employee expects to return to work from carer's leave.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that where, on the resumption of work following a period of carer's leave, it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit the employee to return to the same work as he or she did prior to the leave, suitable alternative work on terms and conditions not less favourable to the employee than those applicable to his or her previous employment shall be provided by the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the protection of employees from penalisation by employers for exercising or proposing to exercise their entitlement to carer's leave.</P>
    <P>Under this section, penalisation includes dismissal, redundancy or any unfavourable change in the conditions of employment. An employee may seek relief against penalisation involving a dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977-73.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with the resolution of disputes. Sections 17 to 19 provide that in the event of certain disputes arising, relating to the employee's entitlement to carer's leave, a claim for redress may be made to a rights commissioner in the first instance with a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. An employee may refer a dispute to a rights commissioner that his or her employer has contravened a provision of the Bill in relation to the employee's right to carer's leave. An employee may seek redress against penalisation &ndash; other than in relation to dismissal &ndash; by an employer for exercising his or her rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Disputes concerning an employer's opinion as to whether a person is a relevant person as defined, and-or whether full-time care and attention is being provided, must be referred for <Col N="93" /> adjudication to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs only. The rights commissioner or the tribunal will be bound by the decision of a deciding officer or an appeals officer of that Department on these issues.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have been excluded from Part 4 of the Bill because they have their own statutory redress mechanisms under the Defence Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that a decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Employment appeals tribunal within six weeks of the date of the decision. The Employment Appeals Tribunal shall issue a determination in writing affirming, varying or setting aside the decision of the rights commissioner. An extension of time to appeal of six weeks may be granted by the tribunal, if it considers it reasonable to do so, having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 21, in regard to redress, provides for matters which may be the subject of a decision of determination by the rights commissioner, or the tribunal, respectively. Among the matters which may be so decided, or determined, are the granting of the carer's leave of such length and at such times as may be specified, or an award of compensation of up 26 weeks' remuneration. This is similar to other employment rights legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that if a party fails to carry out the terms of the decision of a rights commissioner or the determination of the tribunal, the Circuit Court may, on the application of the aggrieved party or of the Minister, make an order directing that it be carried out. In making an order under this section, the Circuit Court may direct the employer to pay interest on the compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the tribunal may refer a question of law arising in proceedings before it to the High Court and a party to proceedings before the tribunal may appeal from a determination of the tribunal, to the High Court, on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the service of documents for the purposes of, or in relation to, proceedings under Part 4 of the Bill on the resolution of disputes. Section 20 provides that compensation due to an employee under this Bill shall be among the debts having priority in the distribution of assets of a company being wound up, or of a bankrupt or arranging debtor.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 30 ensure that other relevant enactments take specific account of the introduction of this Carer's Leave Bill. Accordingly, the relevant Acts in relation to several matters such as redundancy payments, unfair dismissal, organisation of working time, national minimum wage and the protection of employees in the case of employers' insolvency are amended to ensure the protection of a person availing of carer's leave.</P>
    <P>Section 31 was originally inserted at the request of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, that Department now proposes to introduce this section as an amendment of the <Col N="94" /> Social Welfare Bill, 2001. Accordingly, this section will need to be removed from the Carer's Leave Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 32 places an obligation on employers in relation to the keeping of the records and notices relating to carer's leave, and creates an offence in respect of the contravention of this obligation.</P>
    <P>Section 33 confers power on the Minister to appoint persons to be inspectors for the purposes of the Act. The section confers certain powers on the inspectors, and regulates those powers in relation to investigating whether the provisions of the Act are being complied with. The section also creates an offence for, <i>inter alia</i>, giving false or misleading evidence to an inspector, or obstructing or impeding an inspector in the exercise of any of his or her powers under the section. Section 34 makes a general provision for the prosecution of offences under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the House will be supportive of this innovative social legislation which allows people time off from their jobs at a difficult and sensitive time. As has already been said, the Bill honours the Government's commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and budget 2000.</P>
    <P>While the introduction of the Carer's Leave Bill is some three or four months behind the parallel carer's benefit scheme, I understand that, on the ground, some 218 applications for carer's benefit have been received by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. These cases are being dealt with in an expeditious manner by officials in that Department. I should also state that many of these cases have been helped by a compassionate and pragmatic approach on the part of employers which has enabled some of these applicants to leave their jobs, pending the enactment of this Carer's Leave Bill. While the Minister regrets this delay, I want to record that it was this process of harmonising as far as possible the two parallel schemes, namely, carer's benefit and carer's leave, which has delayed proceedings somewhat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 was published on 14 December 2000 and the Christmas break has allowed the House the time to reflect on the provisions of the Bill which I have already outlined in detail. I believe that, in general, there is political consensus and good will on the thrust and intent of the Bill, I would therefore ask the House to proceed with haste in ensuring its early passage. This will give clear signals to employees, employers, and those persons requiring care of <Col N="95" /> the support of this Government and this House for the less fortunate in our society.</P>
    <P>I commend the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on the Carer's Leave Bill. I noted the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, arrived in the House out of breath. I suspect he was passed the baton in respect of this Bill at short notice. The manner in which we organise the business of the House is absurd, with the Department involved in a Second Stage debate here on the Carer's Leave Bill and in Committee Stage at a committee dealing with the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is obviously on duty elsewhere. It makes it extremely difficult for Opposition parties, which do not have the array of resources the Minister has at his disposal, to organise attendance at Second Stage debates here in the House while simultaneously being expected to deal with Committee Stage of another Bill elsewhere. In terms of organising the business of the House, this is something that should be examined.</P>
      <P>Since there are members of staff from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the House, let me take the opportunity to comment on a matter which I raised on the Adjournment last night. I do not intend to delay on it. I received a reply to that debate last night, and a written reply on the same matter yesterday, which were nothing short of a disgrace. This House has been previously reprimanded and admonished, rightly, by various fora outside this House for failing to give appropriate answers to Dáil questions. The type of reply I received is one which I will not, because it would bring this House into disrepute, send to constituents who raised the issue in question with me. I have raised the matter with the Government Chief Whip and with my party's Whip. I will pursue the matter further with the Tánaiste and the Secretary General of the Department. The reply I received was an appalling abuse of the House.</P>
      <P>It would be churlish not to welcome in principle the contents of the Carer's Leave Bill. We are all acutely aware of the debate that rages annually in the run up to the budget and all through the year, fronted by the Carers' Association in the context of the vast array of people in the community who provide care of one type of another for relatives or non-relatives compared to those formally recognised by the State in monetary terms for the care they provide. While I cannot recall exactly the figures, it has been argued there are in excess of 100,000 carers, but of them only 30,000 or fewer are in receipt of some level of carer's allowance and while some are on the maximum rate, others, depending on means assessment, receive significantly less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Bill is a step in the right direction, many would view it with a jaundiced eye in that while many may benefit from it, there are many <Col N="96" /> who labour in vain and get no recognition from the State. We pat ourselves on the back repeatedly for having a Celtic tiger economy, our level of job creation, inflation rate and interest rates, but that begs the question, for what have we all this economic success if we do not use it to build a more equitable society that recognises the valiant efforts of people who carry out a duty that would cost the State significantly more, if it had to step into the breach and provide that level of care? The care those people provide fosters a sense of community and family commitment to which we repeatedly pay lip service but which, in many instances, regrettably we, as a House, collectively, fail to acknowledge in a meaningful fashion by virtue of financial payment.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish not to welcome the Bill. To give 65 weeks' unpaid leave is a step in the right direction, but I agree with Deputy Broughan's point that its introduction is late in the context of carer's benefit, which was previously introduced.  </P>
    <P>Last night we debated an order to give effect to increased paid and unpaid maternity benefit. The point was made, which is also applicable to this debate, that in terms of the social interventions the State makes, notwithstanding our tiger economy, we are the bottom of the league table in many instances compared to our European Union partners. The introduction last night of that order was an issue on which the Department dragged its heels, and as a result approximately 10,000 mothers will be denied that payment this year. It appears we are dragged kicking and screaming in terms of making such provisions, as a result of which we make the beneficiaries of them campaign for so long and fight so hard that at the end of the day the provisions are not delivered to them with any dignity. I am mindful particularly of those who provide care for the most vulnerable. That situation is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I have some queries concerning the combining of carer's benefit and carer's leave. Can one draw one benefit successive to the other, take carer's benefit and then take 65 weeks' unpaid carer's leave? Often those who provide care in the community do so for long and protracted periods. For many, particularly those who care for elderly relatives, it is not a 15 month, two year or three year job. Fortunately, with advances in medical science, people are living longer, but those in need of care require a level of care, intervention and supervision that demands a carer's time for far longer than envisaged under a period of combined carer's benefit and carer's leave. At a minimum, there should be an entitlement to draw both successively.</P>
    <P>In the context of the overview of the operation of the carer's allowance, of which this is an extension of sorts, a justifiable point is the differentiation necessary between care provided by virtue of infirmity due to old age or accident, which, by its nature, would not be for as long a period as the type of care required and provided by people who care for the profoundly handicapped from <Col N="97" /> the moment of birth to their death. The introduction and acknowledgement of that type of differentiation is long overdue. Payment of the carer's allowance should be available regardless of means of those who provide care around the clock for those who are profoundly handicapped. I know of numerous people in my constituency who feel extremely aggrieved about the shortcomings of the carer's allowance in that regard. They provide care for handicapped children, not only every waking hour but every hour of the day, and their concern is who will look after the needs of their handicapped child when they pass on.</P>
    <P>In its review of the carer's allowance scheme, the Government included a recommendation that such differentiation should be acknowledged and payment of carer's allowance should be made to people in those circumstances, but the implementation of that recommendation has been long fingered. We are now talking about involving not only the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that issue has been kicked to the Department of Health and Children for it is to carry out a pilot study on needs assessment. That proposal is contained in the review of the Government's programme of action, or whatever is the fancy title given to it. We need to comprehensively examine the operation of this scheme in its broadest context, acknowledge, in particular, the work done by those who provide care for the profoundly handicapped, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, every year of their lives and recognise that by ensuring they are entitled to the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children on needs assessment and I hope the reply I receive will at least answer the question I asked. Regrettably, the Minister for Health and Children was the person to whom the baton was passed last night to answer the matter I raised on the Adjournment. He bore the brunt of my dissatisfaction, but I have great faith in his response to that parliamentary question. At least I may get an answer to the question I asked.</P>
    <P>I understand carer's leave is reckonable for the purposes of employment rights but not for superannuation purposes. Is that standard procedure or is it a break from the position when one takes unpaid leave for other reasons? If one takes carer's leave, can one make voluntary contributions towards one's superannuation for the period of that leave? That is an area that should be examined, as no one would want the taking of such leave to impact adversely on one's pension entitlements at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I would be churlish not to welcome in broad terms what is contained in the Bill. It is a step in the right direction, but the vast majority of more than 100,000 carers, who get no formal recognition for the care they provide, will look upon this with a jaundiced eye. As a society we need to ask fundamental questions about what we are about. Do we see the creation of a successful economy as an end in itself or is this about using the fruits <Col N="98" /> of a successful economy to build a more equitable society that recognises the difficulties people face in their daily lives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, for attending, though I am sorry Deputy Kitt was unable to stay. I thank the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment officials for the extensive briefing they gave me and Deputy Currie, which was very valuable.</P>
      <P>I welcome the belated appearance of this Bill following a long gestation. This restrictive legislation will make it difficult for many carers to take time out to look after ill relatives and the Labour Party will seek to have the Bill amended significantly on Committee Stage. The delay in bringing the Bill forward is inexcusable and could have serious consequences for carers who have already successfully applied for the new carer's benefit. This morning Deputy Kitt expressed his regrets but it is not good enough that this legislation was not brought forward, as promised, in tandem with carer's benefit. This time last year the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, trumpeted the introduction of carer's benefit in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000. When he outlined Part III of the Bill, which introduced carer's benefit from the following October, it was clearly intended that the complementary legislation before us would be passed in tandem with the new carer's benefit legislation. It is typical of this lethargic and careless Government that the Carer's Leave Bill was not published for almost two months after carer's benefit had begun. A further two months have now elapsed and many more weeks will pass before this protective legislation becomes law. Is it any wonder that the take-up of carer's benefit is so low? </P>
      <P>When I inquired about this during Question Time before Christmas only 11 people had been approved for carer's benefit out of approximately 75 applications, while the Minister told us this afternoon that there are now approximately 218 applications being processed. The Government has basked in self-congratulation for over a year because of the introduction of an important new benefit but it is still only in the process of legislating for this development one year later. That is characteristic of the Government's general treatment of carers. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition has always had a poor law approach to carers and its rigorous determination to uphold the means test for carer's allowance and to deny the vast majority of carers any kind of allowance is, unfortunately, a hallmark of the Government. After four years it does not give a damn about carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has refused to address the chief concerns of carers and every small, belated improvement has been dragged out of him and the Minister for Finance. The bitter criticism of these Ministers and the Government that I hear continuously from individual carers and their rep<Col N="99" /> resentative bodies is a sad testament to the failure of this Administration to address the real needs of citizens shouldering grave family responsibilities. At a time of unprecedented national growth, the famous 100 billion euro economy, the Government's refusal to give real recognition to the most heroic group in our society, our carers, is perhaps the greatest scandal in Irish life today. Regrettably, the Government has failed to live up to even its modest promises to carers when in Opposition four years ago. The lackadaisical treatment of the introduction of carer's benefit and the Carer's Leave Bill are symptoms of the Government's lack of concern for the urgent plight of tens of thousands of carers. I will outline the situation at least 100,000 carers must live every day of every year, as Deputy Creed said.</P>
    <P>Caring is a universal experience. We have all been cared for and we will perhaps be cared for again. All of us have some experience of caring but for a huge number of our fellow citizens, caring for a child or adult with a serious disability or serious illness is, as they rightly say, a 24/7 responsibility: a 24 hour a day job for seven days a week. Yet our Constitution and legislation contains no recognition of the valuable role of the carer.</P>
    <P>A report to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in May 1996 on a long-term support framework for female carers prepared by Mel Cousins stated that despite the rhetoric of support for community care, there had not been any financial commitment by the Government to make care in the community a reality, though there was widespread support in Ireland for the role of community care. That is obvious from the recent debate sparked by the Ombudsman's report on nursing home care. Clearly, family care or care at home is the most desirable setting for many elderly people and people with disabilities. However, there are no signs of the Government showing an interest in the development of a long-term policy on caring in the community. The long-standing demand for a White Paper on caring has been ignored by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and his Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats colleagues voted down the Labour Party's proposed twenty-first amendment to the Constitution. This proposal, introduced by Deputy Quinn, guaranteed rights to housing, health, nutrition and an adequate standard of living. The vindication of the rights of our carers was one of the key reasons for the introduction of that constitutional amendment yet, unfortunately, before Christmas we had to watch as the Government parties almost casually voted down that very important initiative.</P>
    <P>The Minister applauded himself today for the unique character of the carer's benefit legislation but many of our EU partners have passed legislation underpinning the proper provision of services to carers. The Carers (Recognition and Services) Act was passed in the UK in 1995 while Tom Pendry MP put forward the Carers and Dis<Col N="100" /> abled Children Bill in December 1999. These measures provided for the rights of carers to proper needs assessment and services. Such constitutional amendment or legislation is urgently needed in Ireland and the Labour Party is determined to bring in legislation and a constitutional amendment at the earliest opportunity to clarify the fundamental rights of Irish carers once and for all, with particular reference to their health and basic financial needs.</P>
    <P>Such an approach should also incorporate the carer's charter of Care Alliance Ireland. This admirable document lays down 16 rights which, if implemented, would involve the full recognition of carers' needs and their vital contribution to our society. At every turn the formation of policy on carers has been hindered by the lack of an adequate database, which also impinges on this Bill. Reports commissioned by the National Council for the Elderly a decade ago indicated that over 50,000 people provided care for somebody living in the same household, that between 16,000 and 100,000 people provided some care to persons in a different household and that over 70% of these carers were women. There is now a database on intellectual disability and a similar resource is being compiled for those with physical disabilities. I encounter this lack of clear numerical information on carers month in, month out in my parliamentary questions and it is an astonishing dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Health and Children. Hence the Government's almost hysterical reaction to a recent survey showing that there are over 20,000 carers in the Western Health Board area alone.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance published in 1998 estimated that the current number of full-time carers stands at approximately 50,000 people; that covers carers for older people as well as adults and children with disabilities. The much respected Carer's Association estimated in its October 2000 pre-budget submission that there were at least 120,000 family carers in Ireland and when the database is completed I am certain the higher estimate will be the true one.</P>
    <P>In early December 2000 there were only 16,302 recipients of carer's allowance. It was then estimated that Budget 2001 increases and the income disregards for carers, £150 for single carers and £250 for a couple with a joint income, would result in up to 6,000 additional new carers qualifying for payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment. Even with the passage of this Bill it is evident that at least half of the carers, in the narrowest definition of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, are still being excluded from any State financial support. Ultimately, that is the Government's legacy to carers.</P>
    <P>The ongoing struggle of carers is visible throughout society and this uncaring Government gives scant regard to the fundamental reforms necessary to support these people. There was a major story in last weekend's <i>Sunday World</i> by <Col N="101" /> Joanne McElgunn and Joe Barrett. The story was a heart rending account of the situation of a young returning emigrant family, Maria and Geoff Owen, who have returned to Portlaoise and who are caring for their profoundly handicapped son, William. The father had to give up his job and in desperation, because of the lack of financial support and a cost of caring allowance from the Government, they brought their child to offices of the Midland Health Board in Portlaoise. This is a terrible indictment but it is one of thousands of cases Deputies could bring to the attention of the Minister regarding the treatment of carers.</P>
    <P>Carers' health is often seriously damaged as they struggle to care for very ill relatives. Their fundamental right to a healthy lifestyle is often ignored. The Government has failed to address the heartfelt need of carers for adequate funding of respite care and time for themselves. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, is still nowhere near realising the long-standing Labour Party aim of a £1,000 per annum respite grant. The recent budget raised the respite grant by a miserable £100 to £400 per annum. However, problems remain for carers, including the lack of respite places, both day care and longer term care, a lack of transport, especially in rural areas, and the failure to improve the nursing home subvention levels, which still stand at the figure set by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, under the partnership Government eight years ago.</P>
    <P>Carers are deeply resentful of the means test for the carer's allowance and the lack of a cost of caring allowance. The 1996 report, A Long-Term Support Framework for Female Carers, to which I referred, argued that the qualification conditions for the carer's allowance should be removed over time with the long-term aim of awarding the allowance to the carers of all persons requiring full-time care. I and the Labour Party concur with this view. It is time to consign the rotten 19th century means test for carers allowance to the dustbin of history. The restrictive nature of the qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance and the restrictions implicit in the Carer's Leave Bill will ensure that vast numbers of carers will continue to receive no financial support. As the Minister is aware, much of the family income of carers is consumed by the purchase of necessary accessories and supplements for people with disabilities. Hence, the provision of a cost of caring allowance of at least £50 a week or a much improved continual care allowance should be provided.</P>
    <P>The recent expansion of the free schemes to carers is welcome as is the principle of carers benefit and leave. I pay tribute to two of my Labour Party colleagues who worked hard to develop the concept of an insurance based carer's benefit. I am aware that Deputy De Rossa, when he was the Minister for Social Welfare, pushed forward this initiative and sought to move rapidly towards the introduction of carer's benefit. Sadly, it has taken almost four years to realise his ambition. <Col N="102" /> Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, as the Labour Party spokesperson on social, community and family affairs, strongly advocated the idea of carer's benefit and an insurance based benefit during the early years of this Dáil. However, my colleagues conceived a much broader and less restrictive process of protection for carers leave than is advocated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The many reservations of my party about the current restrictive shape of the Carer's Leave Bill are founded on its patent lack of sympathy for the serious dilemmas faced by workers when a relative becomes seriously ill or suddenly deteriorates and needs full-time care in the home. There is also the dilemma faced by many workers with a caring spouse who is denied the carer's allowance and who cares full-time for a severely disabled child or other relative. To such workers, the Bill as it stands is unduly restrictive and lacking in sympathy for the difficult circumstances in which caring relatives and friends may find themselves when they seek to provide full-time care.</P>
    <P>In the definitions at the beginning of the Bill, there appears to be an unnecessary change in comparison to parental leave and employment equality legislation. There is a specific reference to members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in the latter legislation, but it is unclear if these categories of workers are covered by the Carer's Leave Bill. Perhaps the phrase &ldquo;a person holding office under or in the service of the State&rdquo; might be extended to include the Garda and the Defence Forces. The Minister pointed out that the Defence Forces are excluded from Part 4 because they have their own mechanisms under the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3(5) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with any other Minister of the Government who, in the opinion of the Minister, might be concerned with the matter, by regulations exempt from the application of a specified provision or provisions of this Act persons employed in any specified class or classes of activity.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary and wide ranging power to bestow on any Minister to effectively categorise a broad group of almost certainly public sector workers in this way. The House is often rightly concerned with the enormous range of power conferred on the Executive to act by regulation. The rest of section 3 appears par for the course with regard to ministerial ability to act by way of regulation under most legislation. Subsection (5) appears to be of a different order and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, in his reply could indicate the persons employed in any specified class or classes of activity who might be disbarred from the protection of the Bill following consultations with some other Minister. Perhaps the best solution in the interest of the protection of workers giving care is to delete the subsection on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains a number of contentious provisions which my party would like amended. <Col N="103" /> The requirement in subsection (1) of 12 months continuous employment by an employee from the employer to whom the application for carer's leave is made appears unduly long and out of line with the Social Welfare Act, 2000, which introduced carer's benefit and which is facilitated by the Carer's Leave Bill. As the Minister said earlier, the benefit and carer's leave should operate in tandem. Why is there a difference between the provision for carer's benefit in the social welfare legislation and the provision in the Bill where a worker needs to take carer's leave?</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Social Welfare Act, 2000, states that benefits shall be paid to a carer who has engaged in remunerative full-time employment as an employed contributor for the three month period immediately prior to the first day in respect of which a claim for carer's benefit is made. In that case, the time span is three months. Why is there a discrepancy between the Bill and the legislation introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs? The qualification work period of three months for carer's benefit should be the same under the Carer's Leave Bill for the employer to whom the application for carer's leave is made. Instead of working in tandem, the two Departments appear to be at loggerheads.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, contains a 12 month continual service requirement. However, the Act also stipulates that where an employee has not completed one year's continuous employment with an employer, but has completed at least three months of such employment, that employee is entitled to parental leave for a period of one week for each month of continuous employment completed with the employer concerned. Why could there not be a similar provision in the Carer's Leave Bill, thus ensuring that an employee with less than 12 months' continuous employment with the employer concerned would also qualify for a proportion of carer's leave? The Labour Party intends to table amendments in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party made strenuous objections to the initial 52 week provision for carer's benefit in the 2000 budget. In strong support of the Carers Association, we demanded that the period be greatly extended in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000. We were grateful to the Minister, Deputy Ahern, when he gave a slight extension to the period of carers benefit in the Social Welfare Bill, but the 65 week period still appears arbitrarily short when one considers the daily and enormous caring task faced by many workers in their family lives. Carers have made a cogent case for three year carer's leave and there is a precedent in the public service for, albeit unpaid, lengthy career breaks. The caring needs of an elderly parent may often be acute for lengthier periods than 65 weeks as experienced carers have repeatedly demonstrated. I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to <Col N="104" /> examine the extension of this provision to at least 18 months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the application in the Bill of the ten hours a week rule for worker training, which applies to carer's benefit and carer's allowance. However, despite the rationale for the introduction of carer's leave, including a desire to spread the caring function more widely in the community, the Bill places a prohibition on any efforts to share the role of caring between a number of workers who might be siblings, for example, caring for two aged and infirm parents. Once again, the Minister has flown in the face of the reality of many people's lives where a number of people might prefer to work part-time and care for a person with a disability. An obvious solution for many families is prevented and two employees working for different employers could not both share the caring role for their parent while remaining in the work force on a part-time basis. One of the key elements of the carer's charter is to seek the ongoing involvement of all members of a family in discharging a duty of care to parents and siblings, and therefore I ask the Minister to look again at these provisions of section 6 and allow for part-time care by a number of carers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the supplementary provisions to section 6, where the proposed legislation allows for the application of a second period of carer's leave for a second person needing care up to a total leave period of 130 weeks, contained in section 7. This provision echoes the experience of many people in relation to the care of two elderly parents, where the illness of one is often a prelude to medical problems for both, especially where one parent has cared for the other through difficult times.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 8 allowing an employer to refuse, without reason, to permit an employee to take a period of carer's leave which is less than 13 weeks' duration is extraordinary in its scope. Presumably the employee would already have secured a decision from a deciding officer under the Social Welfare Act, 1993, granting him or her carer's benefit, yet under subsection (2) an employee, whose elderly parent or child requires only six or seven weeks' full-time care and attention, may be prevented by the employer from taking leave to provide that care and of course the employer need not give any reason. In practice, the provisions of section 8 will operate against employees who must avail of this leave to care for an extremely ill parent, spouse or child. In circumstances which families face every day, this subsection places an obstacle in the way of employees who must try to meet urgent and serious caring needs. At the very least, a refusal by an employer to allow an employee to take a period of carer's leave which is less than 13 weeks' duration should be the basis for a referral by the employee of the issue to a rights commissioner. Given the seven day, 24 hour reality of the lives of many carers, the provision in section 8(3) of a prohibition of another period <Col N="105" /> of carer's leave until a period of six weeks has elapsed seems unduly restrictive. All carers are familiar with the good days, bad days quality of the lives of people with serious illness and the familiarity of sudden relapses. Given that, perhaps the Minister would agree to an amendment allowing for exceptional circumstances to be allowed where fewer than six weeks has elapsed.</P>
    <P>I referred above to, and briefly welcomed, section 7 which recognised the family circumstances, again so familiar to many, where two elderly parents often need full-time care, either contemporaneously or in swift succession, yet section 8(4) seems to negate the caring effects of employees in the latter circumstances. This subsection insists that where an employee has completed a full period of carer's leave in respect of one person, he or she is not permitted to commence carer's leave in respect of another relevant person until a period of 12 months has passed since the termination of the first period of carer's leave. Therefore, in cases where the death of one elderly parent is quickly followed by serious illness of the second parent, a carer who has taken leave to care for the first parent may be prevented from caring during the final illness of the second parent because of the restriction in this subsection. Once more, the Minister should consider the substitution of this provision by a subsection allowing a second period of caring within a relatively short time where family circumstances require it.</P>
    <P>Section 9(1) obliges an employee to give at least six weeks' notice before a proposed commencement of carer's leave. While the Parental Leave Act, 1998, contains a similar provision, this length of notice seems unduly long given the kind of caring emergencies which might arise. The Labour Party would like to see this provision reduced to four weeks, as in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 9(4) appears to give <i>carte blanche</i> to an employer to use his or her discretion to decide whether carer's leave is actually carer's leave, where for understandable reasons the employee has not complied with all the terms of the notice. It is our view that an employee's rights should not be placed at the discretion of the employer under the Bill and should be vindicated by reference to a rights commissioner at this subsection, and we will return to that by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which deals with a central issue of protection of the employment rights of employees and carer's leave, differs significantly with similar provisions of the Parental Leave Act.</P>
    <P>On section 14, since the Carer's Leave Bill excludes annual leave and public holidays from the employee's rights during carer's leave, as another Deputy stated, why should a carer be treated less favourably in this regard? This section should be amended to include annual leave and public holidays in order that there is equality between both types of carer covered by the Parental Leave Act and by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is an important provision which <Col N="106" /> allows reference by the employer to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of various aspects of the caring role of an employee while on carer's leave. This section reiterates the ongoing close relationship of the administration of carer's benefit and carer's leave and the necessity for close collaboration between the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure the success of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>In the appeals procedure to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under section 20, the six weeks period for lodging an appeal should be reduced to &ldquo;within four weeks&rdquo;. This would be consistent with the timescale within which an appeal may be lodged at a similar point under the Parental Leave and Maternity Acts. I note the Minister stated this morning that he is removing section 31, which now will be handled by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 28 to 30, inclusive, which will add the Bill to the provisions of such important legislation as the Organisation of Working Time Act, the National Minimum Wage Act and the Protection of Employees Act. When the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, is being passed through the Oireachtas shortly, it is important that the Bill, on enactment, be included in the list of relevant legislation covered in the other new employees' rights legislation.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that there should be provision in the Bill for a review of its operation, perhaps within two or three years after it becomes law. This would be consistent with the provisions of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, and should involve in a similar way representatives of employers and employees affected by the operation of the new carer's leave law.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Carer's Leave Bill fulfils an important policy of the Labour Party to address the grave difficulties of carers in society but, as you have heard, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Labour Party and, indeed, the labour movement have serious problems with the restricted Bill. The Bill needs major amendment before it will even nearly meet the profound needs of workers who wish to spend even a short period as carers.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few brief final comments about the Bill and about carers generally. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, spoke at length about people taking carer's leave at their own expense, but is this realistic? One must ask what world does he inhabit? Obviously it is true that failure to qualify for carer's benefit does not necessarily mean that an employee cannot avail of the leave, but surely the Government should be aiming at providing proper financial support to working carers to enable them to take time out. In that regard, in the recently published Social Welfare Bill, 2001, the carer's benefit will rise to £96.50 a week, an increase from last year's £88.50. Of course this £88.50 was drawn, as I have <Col N="107" /> said, by fewer than a dozen people during 2000. The Government lived off the publicity of introducing carer's benefit for a whole year without actually introducing it, which is an extraordinary public relations achievement. There is no adult dependant allowance with this benefit, and the child dependant allowance is still only £13.20. My party still believes that benefits such as this should be aiming at 34%, as the lowest benchmark, of average industrial wages. Even £96.50 is still a very modest sum on which to expect a worker to live for 65 weeks, 13 weeks or whatever the period would be. It is an extraordinarily small sum of money and one, in the context of general social welfare provision, to which we should return.</P>
    <P>To return to the issue I raised at the outset, there has been an unpardonable delay of a year in the introduction of the Carer's Leave Bill. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, had time to prepare it, bring it before us and have it enacted and in place before 26 October, when carer's benefit started. We knew, since the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's, budget in December 1999, that the carer's benefit would come into effect on 26 October and therefore they had a year to prepare but they did not do so. Incidentally, it does not instil confidence that on 1 January 2002 the changeover to the payment of social welfare in euros will be achieved and raises fears that many people will not receive the increases due. It is sad that a significant group of people, who have applied and whose applications have been processed, are not covered by the protection afforded by this legislation and I ask the Minister to look at this.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the principle of carer's leave in the same way I welcomed the introduction of carer's benefit. I hope it is a route by which many hard-pressed carers will be able to take time out from work to care for a much loved relative or friend and that it will be taken up by several thousand carers. In essence it is just one of a number of significant measures which the Government should be taking to vindicate carers' rights. In particular, there is a need for fundamental legislation or legislation amending the Constitution guaranteeing these rights and, above all, to abolish the hated means test for the carer's allowance. With those caveats, I thank the Minister of State and welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank Deputy Broughan for some insights into what has and has not been done and I intend to address some of those issues in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for a new entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid carer's leave to enable them to care personally for persons who require full-time care and attention. In that respect, it is a very important Bill. It fulfils the Government's commitment in the budget of 2000 and in the Pro<Col N="108" /> gramme for Prosperity and Fairness of providing a legislative framework to give effect to the carer's benefit payment and a parallel right to carer's leave.</P>
    <P>Carers had for years gone unrecognised and undervalued in society, if they were valued at all. That was wrong. Carers have played and continue to play an essential role in many homes throughout Ireland, and I am glad that what small recognition they have gained has been attained under the current Government. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for the Bill and also the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the large range of measures to which he has added in the recent budgets and Social Welfare Acts. Carers deserve to be rewarded for their dedication and devotion to those in need and this should not be just in words of praise but in terms of real financial recognition without means testing. It is not means but PRSI contributions which are the basis of this benefit.</P>
    <P>This aspiration towards recognition is pursued by the Government not only in the action taken in the Bill but on an ongoing basis since we came into office. Fianna Fáil recognises the enormous contribution carers make to the lives of others through their sacrifices and devotion to the needs of those who are less fortunate. These sacrifices involve significant personal costs, be they physical, financial or psychological. Historically, a mother, daughter, daughter in law or some family member generally rallied to the cause of caring for the elderly relative who as an invalid, the disabled child or whoever needed care. They often did this at the expense of their own careers but they did this task, by and large, out of love for the person concerned and without seeking favour. As the Minister of State said, the family rallied to the call.</P>
    <P>Things have changed and moved on in many ways and, while this does not change the basic need of those who are cared for, it creates a need for a new sense of balance between home and work. I hope the Bill will assist in the continuing review of how to marry the changing needs of the workplace with the ever growing demands of family life. I hope that family friendly workplace arrangements allow us to address the need to reconcile work and family life to the mutual benefit of workers and employers.</P>
    <P>Looking at examples of carers in my area, they are people who have tended for years to the every need of a relative or friend who, at times, through one form of illness or another, has not been the easiest of patients. I especially think of carers who are now ageing and who do not have the same physical strength for the job or the stamina for the length of day their charges present to them. These people live away from bus routes, have no car and the charge may not have been to the local town for years because no one else in that remote area is able to care for him or her to give the carer that well deserved break.</P>
    <P>From my brief experience as a politician having <Col N="109" /> met people in various situations who have dependent family members and coming, as I do, from an immediate family with no such difficulties, I know support for those who cannot help themselves and for those who care for them is extremely important. Thus the action the programme for Government promised, to increase the real value of the carer's allowance and that more carers would qualify for the allowance, was essential. The fact that both these objectives have been delivered shows that the Government, contrary to what Deputy Broughan said, has not just talked the talk. It has continued to raise the standards it wished to attain and has added extra and very important supports each year.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline what has been done since we came into office. Perhaps someone from the Opposition can defend the record of the rainbow Government when it was in power when Deputy Quinn held the purse strings tightly. In 1998 there were significant additional budget increases for carers over 66 years of age and a free travel pass for everyone on a carer's allowance was introduced. In 1999, creditable contributions were awarded to eligible carers, the back to work scheme was extended to carers who ceased caring responsibilities and the annual payment of £200 towards respite care was introduced. Deputy Broughan described it as miserly and derisory but I did not see it in place when he and his party had an opportunity to do something which he said they were eager to do at the time. Other measures included the extension of the carer's allowance to carers of people between 16 and 65 and to those caring for recipients of domiciliary care allowance, the extension of free telephone rental allowance to carers, the application of a £75 means disregard to the income of a single carer and £150 to the joint income of a married carer, the relaxation of the residency rule and the relaxation of the full-time care and attention rule to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid employment for up to ten hours per week.</P>
    <P>In 2000 carers receiving the carer's allowance no longer had to satisfy the 13 paid contributions rule when claiming disability benefit, the annual respite grant was raised by £100 to £300 &ndash; when did that happen before &ndash; the back to education allowance scheme was extended to carers who ceased caring responsibilities, the free electricity and free television licence schemes were extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance, which ensured carers were in receipt of all free schemes, and the carer's benefit scheme was introduced which necessitated the legislation under discussion.</P>
    <P>Not only has the Minister worked hard in Cabinet to lay the foundations on which to attain these improvements, he has made sure those entitled to support are fully aware of their rights, whether financial, employment or educational support measures, through the information booklet, Carer's Allowance &ndash; Keeping You Informed, which his Department issued to more than 16,000 <Col N="110" /> people in 2000. This pro-active approach to getting information to those entitled to assistance is refreshing and gives a true sense of the partnership between the Department and those it serves. For too long people have come to me having only realised when a child is ten or 12 that they were entitled to domiciliary care allowance. No one told them. No one caring for a child or adult should have to figure out his or her entitlements. They should be made known to them. In that respect, the Minister deserves our vote of confidence and congratulations for his initiatives which he continues to expand.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget there is a significant relaxation of the income disregard which applies to the means test for the carer's allowance which increases the number eligible by about 5,000 apart from current recipients. There is a £10 increase for carers over 66 and an £8 a week increase for those aged under 66. According to Deputy Broughan and the Labour Party, this is a terribly small amount, but I remember in my first year in the Dáil five years ago when we were in Opposition the children's allowance being increased by £1 a month or 25p a week, which would not even have bought a bar of chocolate at the time. In saying a £10 increase is miserly, one is measured by what one does when one has the strength to do something. This Government is delivering.</P>
    <P>The weekly increases will come into effect four weeks earlier than in previous years, that is, April. The income disregard for means assessment for the carer's allowance scheme is increased to £125 and £250. The respite care payment is increased to £400 per annum. This is a significant amount of money for people and, in the short time since the Minister introduced the scheme, it has been important to people. I will not let the Labour Party deride the value of this scheme introduced by the Minister. The sum of £400 per annum with a double payment for a person caring for more than one person is significant and further underlines that the Government has not ended its commitment to improving the lot of both carers and those cared for.</P>
    <P>In cold monetary terms, carers save the country many millions of pounds annually in that the numbers entering nursing homes or other institutions are only a fraction of what they could be. In human terms, the quality of life of those being cared for is enhanced by the fact that they can remain at the location with which they are most familiar among those for whom they care most. Each one of us knows of elderly people who, for one reason or another, were removed from their own environment to an institution and who, in every case, went downhill immediately afterwards and did not live as long as they would have if they had been left in their own environment. Carers ensure elderly persons live out their lives to their full potential in their own environment. This simply cannot be measured in monetary terms. I am not being patronising in saying that those being cared for are not always a burden in a home, they <Col N="111" /> give much to those caring for them in day-to-day experiences.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government has listened to and included carers who had been deprived of the allowance because they lived close &ndash; perhaps next door &ndash; to the person being cared for as well as those working part time or in education through the relaxation of the full-time rules, it is only logical that it should introduce a scheme to release someone in full-time employment for up to 65 weeks to gain, while caring for someone in need of care, a benefit of £96.50 &ndash; this compares with a figure of £88.50 last year &ndash; not an insignificant rise for what is a new scheme, although I accept that it may be lower than what the person concerned may be earning in the workplace.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said, the Bill is a further recognition of the important role played by carers in society. We must continue to provide support and practical assistance for them. This legislation will make it possible for workers to make the temporary choice of becoming a carer without loss of employment. As the Minister of State said, it is the first of its kind in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to strike a balance &ndash; Deputy Broughan referred to some of the problems being encountered &ndash; between the needs of employers and those of employees. The Bill tries to strike that balance. It is only when the Bill is in operation that we will be able to evaluate how successful it has been. I assume the section under which an employer will be allowed to refuse an employee leave where the period of leave sought is less than 13 weeks is designed to maintain a certain level of continuity for the employer. I understand this was negotiated and decided between the ICTU and IBEC and is considered reasonable. I assume also that not all employers will exercise this right if it is decided that the 65 weeks can be taken in separate units. In the case of someone caring for a terminally ill person, should the period extend beyond 65 weeks, surely it can be agreed between the employer and employee that a level of discretion will be shown should the same discretion be shown by the Department.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 disputes relating to an employee's employment rights &ndash; for example, length of continuous service, the right to return to work and redundancy payments &ndash; will be dealt with by a rights commissioner in the first instance and on appeal by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate. This is both welcome and important. Deputy Broughan argued that the redress mechanism should be similar to that outlined in the Maternity Leave Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. The Minister of State has already answered that question, he has indicated that they will be in line.</P>
    <P>Before leave can be taken, an employee must be in the constant employment of an employer for 12 months. I am aware of many cases, however, where the only choice people had was <Col N="112" /> to give up work completely as the alternative was institutionalisation of the loved one being cared. It is unfortunate that they will not benefit under the Bill. I ask the Minister of State to look at this point, although I accept that the Bill will not apply retrospectively.</P>
    <P>While carers deserve this scheme, they have other needs. They need the backup and support of the health services. The Government has focused on the elderly and the disabled in the provision of facilities and resources with the shortest possible waiting time. A Minister of State with responsibility for older people is an important resource and assists in the development of a coherent national strategy for the development of services for older people who will account for a large percentage of those covered by this benefit.</P>
    <P>I understand the strategy is at an advanced stage and will cover such issues as specialist-led services in the form of assessment and rehabilitation units and day hospitals; extended care and community nursing units, including nursing and convalescent care, respite care and palliative care; community based services and supports in the form of day care centres and care in the home through care teams and home helps and services for the elderly mentally infirm. These services have been made much more accessible in recent budgets, through the announcement of an increase in pensions, but, more significantly, the introduction of free medical cards for those over the age of 70 years. This will ensure those who in the past would have thought twice about going to a doctor due to the cost implications will now feel more confident about the entire process. This is an excellent development not only from the point of view of the patient, but from the point of view of the carer who in the past has battled to have their charge look for more assistance from the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many excellent staff within the medical profession, in particular within the North Western Health Board, for tending to the many small details which can improve the quality of life of individuals in a substantial manner. Many people in my constitutency are working hard in a voluntary capacity in the provision of voluntary housing, the development of high dependency units, respite care and in the exertion of pressure to have nursing homes, day hospitals and other support units provided. Many others are involved in the James Connolly Hospital summer house and schools such as St. Nicholas and Scoil Íosagáin special schools in Buncrana and Carndonagh community school. Many people are doing a lot of work to try to integrate those who may in the past have been left to be cared for at home. That is as it should be. What is happening in relation to the Alzheimer's unit in Carndonagh? The project seems to be on hold.</P>
    <P>Under the Government home help pay has improved while the number of hours provided for has increased. Given the age profile of the population, this is a resource that deserves, merits and <Col N="113" /> needs constant upgrading. Home helps provide a service for a huge number of people that cannot easily be assessed in monetary terms. Enough hours can never be provided for.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the case of the Independent Living Association. Fianna Fáil aims to promote and facilitate independent living and to enhance the quality of life of those with physical and sensory disabilities. Through works already commenced, support is available for the development of a comprehensive range of flexible community services to meet the needs of people with disabilities, their families and carers. I look forward to the day when a greater number of personal assistants will be available. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to continue various initiatives under FÁS to help the people concerned achieve their objective, that is, to participate fully in life, not an unrealistic dream for anyone to have.</P>
    <P>The quality of life of people with a physical or intellectual disability is greatly enhanced by the hard work and devotion of their carers. Their input helps many of our citizens to reach their potential and who would find life intolerable without their support. It is important that the Government continues to reward and recognise the work of carers who are prepared to give of themselves physically, financially and psychologically, a cost which their role exacts. I would like to see far greater access to carer's allowance. This recognition must always be all-encompassing through resourcing not only the carer and the person being cared for in the home, but continually increasing the available facilities for respite care, holiday opportunities, support and guidance services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill, the general gist of which is very appropriate and worthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle. As previous speakers said, there must be changes. I have great time for Deputy Keaveney and I was interested in her contribution but I do not agree that carers have been looked after. They have been let down by all Governments. Carers do a wonderful job but they are not respected by the State or the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and are not given the help they need.</P>
      <P>If the husband or wife of a working couple decides to give up work to become a full-time carer he or she will be means tested. If they give up work, they can take time off but at their own expense. People are angry about the means test because it is wrong. There should some recognition for the work these people do even if they are above the earnings threshold. The first £50, £60 or £70 should be tax exempt. They save the State more than £300 per week because their work means that people are not looked after in institutions. The taxpayer is being saved a fortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney asked what previous Governments had done. We must be honest and fair. This is the first Government since the found<Col N="114" /> ation of the State that has had money and the opportunity to do something for carers. Previous Governments of various hues had to make choices. That is not the case now because the money is available. We never had as much money and the question is where to spend it. The Government's policy is to look after the rich. The rich are getting richer, middle income earners are squeezed and the poor are getting poorer. I do not agree with the flowery speeches of programme managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a programme manager. The previous Fine Gael-led Government increased the old age pension by £1.80 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should display some manners. He will have his opportunity. We have not heard much from him lately because he is doing too much travelling around the country. It is in this House that we want to hear from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing too well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not like the truth because it hurts. Why did carers and the people they look after have to campaign for their rights outside the House before the budget? Previous speakers outlined what the Government had done. It has provided a measly £10 per week while inflation has been running at 7%. The Minister of State will also have an answer for that. The Government gives an increase to carers with one hand and takes it off them with the other because the economy has been allowed to run off the beam.</P>
      <P>The point was made about balance between employers and employees. When we bring legislation through the House, we refer to companies which employ 30, 40 and in some cases 100 or 150 people. From time to time I am approached by small employers, who may only have one or two people working for them. The same rules and regulations affect them. It is not easy to replace employees on a short-term basis in urban or rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>If one is releasing an employee for 12, 13 or 14 weeks, it is difficult to find replacements. It is fine in large companies or in the Minister's office where he has programme managers, assistant programme managers and various secretaries and assistant secretaries. However, if an employer has two people working for him and one decides to leave, it is difficult to replace that person and the business is put in jeopardy. I would like the Minister to respond to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State might bring the Minister's attention to a case I came across recently which involved two elderly people in north Mayo and their daughter and related to the free schemes. There are more than 20,000 carers in the Western Health Board area. The daughter of the couple had to leave the Minister of State's constituency &ndash; she may even be a supporter of his &ndash; to look after them in Mayo. Her husband <Col N="115" /> had died and she was living alone. She must pay rent for her house to the local authority. If she was a carer living five or six miles from her parents she would have been able to avail of the free schemes but because she comes from another county and, therefore, another jurisdiction, she must pay rent for and pay a man to put a fire on and keep an eye on her house. She has made a sacrifice and moved to the west to look after her mother and father, who are seriously ill. She does not qualify for the free schemes in regard to her own home. That should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The woman is worse off financially because she must pay a neighbour to look after her house. She was debarred from availing of the free schemes because she was not living in her own home. She could not live in the Minister of State's constituency and in north Mayo at the same time but she could not give up her house because when her parents die she intends to return to her home. Her son is married in the area and she will return there to live. The woman should be able to avail of the free schemes. She will not need to do so forever but she should be assisted. She still has to pay bills as she has kept her ESB connection and she is still paying rent and heating bills. She is a carer and is saving the taxpayer a great deal of money. Something should be done for her.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister's comment that people's quality of life had improved because of the booming economy and they had more disposable income. People's quality of life has never been as bad because in the past, particularly in rural Ireland, when sons and daughters got married they moved into the family home and one of them would look after elderly relatives. Couples must battle to make a living to pay their mortgages and both partners must work. it is impossible for one or the other to leave work to care for older people because of the price of property and other pressures. I come across this on a daily basis in my clinics. People are concerned about home help because they do not know whether the health board will provide home helps. It is becoming more difficult to recruit home helps because family members are prevented from taking up the position and most young people leave rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>On Friday night next, John Grant will receive the Mayo Person of the Year award in Dublin. He set up the Alzheimer's unit in Claremorris and plans to set up other units throughout the county. He had foresight, vision and an understanding of carers because the biggest factor affecting carers is that they get no respite. They get no assistance. When a family member takes up the responsibility of looking after a young or old person in need of full-time care everybody, including the State, public representatives and the health boards, forgets about them. Once the person is being looked after, the carer is left to do the job. The one factor that gets them down and sickens them is that there is no help available to <Col N="116" /> them. They feel isolated and trapped with no escape.</P>
    <P>I compliment John Grant who recognised this problem and organised the respite units. The units give full-time carers the opportunity of taking a week, a few days or a few weekends off. It is wonderful. I wish him and his organisation well. John Flannery is chairman of the three counties organisation. They broke away a number of years ago because they felt the national organisation was not giving them the same amount of funding and that the State was not assisting them. They believed there were not enough nursing homes and the health boards did not have the vision to see the problem. I compliment both John Flannery and John Grant for putting this on a full-time basis and providing relief for carers. There is a massive demand for it and there is a waiting list for people who are just trying to get a break.</P>
    <P>People want to look after their families. I agree with Deputy Keaveney that old people who have lived all their lives in their own homes and who are moved from that environment into a hospital, which might be up to 30 miles away, tend to last only a short while before dying. They just fade away. The vast majority of people want to die at home, if possible and if carers or family members are available to take care of them.</P>
    <P>I hope this or the next Government will consider the position of carers. The money spent on them is well spent. The means test thresholds should be trebled. There should be recognition of the work done by carers, regardless of whether their spouses have good jobs, even if it is only as little as £50 or £60 per week. I hope the Government will have the courage to do that.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the more than 100,000 carers in this country. They are giving wonderful service to the State and saving it a fortune. We do not have sufficient public institutions for people in need of full-time care. It would cost a fortune if every one of them had to be put into public homes. The carers deserve our thanks for the wonderful job they do. Indeed, other family members often forget to thank the family member who is caring at home. Sometimes they are even critical of them and forget the pressures they are under. It is not easy to look after an old or sick person. Some of them can be very nice but some can be difficult which is natural given their circumstances and the fact they are sick and probably frustrated. Sometimes we do not give carers the thanks and the understanding they deserve.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Office of the Ombudsman for unearthing one of our greatest scandals. I also compliment the journalists who picked up the story from the Ombudsman's report. The Ombudsman's report on nursing homes revealed how the health boards behaved towards relatives and family members with regard to subventions. In the first place, the amount of subvention was a scandal. I note it is due to be increased in the near future and I welcome that. That issue must be dealt with because not enough money is provided in subvention, <Col N="117" /> particularly in view of the price of nursing homes at present. The health boards look at this in the context of needs and the subvention is evaluated according to what type of care is required.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of the health boards a number of years ago was outrageous. I got a letter today from a person in America who had read in the newspapers about the subventions. This person asked me to try to get back the money he had to send from America. These were family members who had to leave the State when there was no economic boom. They went abroad and worked to send home money to keep their parents in nursing homes in this State. The State took money illegally from these people. I am glad the Minister will ensure that whatever money was taken from people in those circumstances will be returned quickly to them. The least the health boards and others who were responsible for this scandal should get is a rap across the knuckles.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children in a recent interview in a Sunday newspaper. They felt the Civil Service, in some cases, is getting out of hand. There are some wonderful civil servants, caring people in the health service who deal compassionately and well with old people. Others, however, who think they are protected by their work for the health boards, councils and so forth believe they can treat people like dirt. That should not be allowed. There should be some protection against these people. The public does not deserve to be treated that way.</P>
    <P>If mistakes are made and people are treated wrongly, there should be a means to make complaints and when the complaints are made, the people concerned should not be protected by the health boards, councils and other staff. If officials are not doing their job, are not nice with the public or are doing something wrong, they should be dealt with and the people who work with them should not be afraid to express that view to their superiors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It will help those in full-time employment who wish to give full-time care to their father or mother to do just that. However, somebody who leaves full-time employment to go onto the carer's allowance of £88.50 or the new level of £96 will experience a change in their standard of living. I suppose it will be worth it for the satisfaction they will get as a result of being with their loved ones and caring for them in their hour of need. I compliment them for doing that.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation works. If there are problems with the Bill and amendments are tabled on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister will take accept them. We are here to give the best possible help and support to carers. They deserve our help and something should be done for them now when there is real money available.</P>
    <P>There are more than 100,000 carers in the country and in excess of 20,000 of them are in the Western Health Board region. The elderly population is a big problem in rural Ireland. It is a <Col N="118" /> problem that will grow because there will be many more older people who will need care. People are living longer, which is good, and they should be allowed to live comfortably in their last years. These are the people who built this economy. We will be the next generation of older people and we will be judged by what we did for our elderly and what we should have done for them. If we do not look after them, how can we expect the upcoming generation to look after us?</P>
    <P>It is important that carers are given whatever help and assistance they need. I compliment Mr. Collins of the National Carers Organisation who has been on this case for many years. He knows the frustration being experienced by carers and I agree with them. I hope this Bill will meet the needs and demands in that area and that it will help people in employment who are anxious to look after their elderly relatives.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Government need not get carried away. I will know they are committed to carers when real money is provided for them. The Government has that money. When we see proper support and help for carers, I will accept that the Government is serious about the elderly, the sick and those who need full-time care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but it will require serious alteration on Committee Stage and I am confident the Minister will accept Opposition amendments which will improve its provisions. The Minister faults Members of the Opposition for constantly condemning his actions but, while we have been critical in the past, we will acknowledge any positive step he takes to improve the lot of carers.</P>
      <P>The Bill will improve and safeguard the position of carers in that the employment rights of a person in employment who becomes a full-time carer will be protected. People will be entitled to take 15 months off work to care for a person in the home and to get their jobs back after that time. I note that people may not necessarily get their old jobs back and that aspect must be ironed out. This legislation will affect employers as well as employees who become carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 states that two members of the same family cannot take leave from employment to care for a person in their home. When a child, or more usually an elderly parent, requires full-time care and attention, that places a very severe burden on the carer. Perhaps the Minister could consider allowing two members of the same family to avail of carer's leave. The task of caring is a very stressful one, particularly if the person being cared for has had a stroke and is incontinent and bedridden. It would benefit both the carer and the person receiving the care if the caring responsibilities could be shared between two people on a three and a half day week basis. That <Col N="119" /> would ensure the carer would not become completely exhausted and that the person receiving the care would not be affected by a carer who could, through sheer stress, occasionally lose his or her temper.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether people who avail of leave under the Bill will be entitled to mid-year respite care in the same way as people who are currently receiving the carer's allowance? It would be very strange if that were not the case.</P>
    <P>The leave provided under the Bill will be granted for a 15 month period. What will happen if a family member takes leave from employment and if the person for whom he or she is caring requires care for a period longer than 15 months? Would such carers lose all their rights under the Bill or could they return to work after 15 months and allow another family member to avail of the leave to continue providing care? </P>
    <P>We cannot debate a Bill such as this without referring to the situation in which carers find themselves. There are some strange anomalies in the carer's allowance. If the wife of a person in employment qualifies for the carer's allowance which is £80.50 per week, she will lose £33.60 per week if her spouse is paying the top rate of tax because her allowance will also be taxable. That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The other huge anomaly in regard to carer's allowance arises where a carer, usually a woman, cares for her husband's father, for example, who may be bed ridden and doubly incontinent. If the carer's husband dies, she will receive the widow's pension but lose the carer's allowance in spite of the fact that she continues to be a full-time carer. That anomaly should be corrected. The Minister has informed me on numerous occasions that it is not possible to pay people two social welfare payments. There is a limited number of carers in the country and there would not be ten people throughout the country in any one year period who would be widowed but continue to be carers. Special provision should be made for such people.</P>
    <P>Deputies bring their personal experiences to bear in this House in an effort to assist their constituents. I am aware of a case where a woman provided care in circumstances such as those I described. Her husband was a small farmer and, as his weekly income was less than £150, she qualified for the carer's allowance. Sadly, she was widowed following her husband's death in an accident. She applied for the widow's pension, which she received, but she lost the carer's allowance in the same week. That is not just. That woman was further penalised by the Department as a result of being widowed. She now has to employ a labourer to do the farm work because she provides care to her father-in-law 24 hours a day for 365 days a year. I will use every available opportunity to highlight this serious anomaly.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that an employee must be in the continuous employment of the employer from <Col N="120" /> whose employment the leave is to be taken for at least 12 months prior to the commencement of leave.</P>
    <P>That is something that should be examined as well.</P>
    <P>Suppose someone has changed job and has been working with an employer for up to eleven and a half months. Suppose his or her father or mother has a stroke or, God forbid, an accident, and he or she must leave employment to become a full time carer. As this person has not worked with that employer for 12 months he or she does not qualify for carer's leave. The person concerned must leave the job and will not have any guarantee of the job being there if the parent dies within the 15 month period and he or she seeks to return to work. That anomaly should be corrected.</P>
    <P>An employee is entitled to a maximum of 65 weeks. If care is necessary after 15 months, a person cannot simply walk out and leave the person for whom he or she cares. That is another anomaly which should be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that carer's leave is unpaid but reckonable for purposes of employment rights other than superannuation. That aspect of the Bill should be examined as it penalises the person who in a job may earn £200 or £300 a week but who comes home to care for someone and gets £80 a week. Such people should not lose their pension rights if they take time off from work to care for a person in the home who needs care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for sharing time with me and I support many of the issues raised by him in his well constructed address. I welcome the introduction of the Carer's Leave Bill to the Dáil, as does every member of the House.</P>
      <P>It is an indication that the Government realises the important role of carers in society. This is a small step in the right direction. One would have expected more. There was an opportunity to do more, as we have been talking around this issue and putting proposals forward from every side of the House. There was an opportunity to take a major step forward with this Bill to do something positive. There was a realisation that we understand the problems and needs of carers in many families.</P>
      <P>We can go through history and see the sacrifices that many family members made in giving up their future in life to care for a handicapped brother, sister, parent or family member. These sacrifices were made without any expectation that anyone would reward them. Many poor people thought reward would be theirs in the next world. They had that faith and that must also be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Life moves on and we are in a new society, where both incomes of a young couple are necessary to address the problems of mortgage repayments. The parents or a handicapped person within the family may need to be cared for. That realisation is there. It is traditional to our people, <Col N="121" /> but the nursing home concept is not acceptable. Nursing homes play a role but the last thing an elderly or handicapped person wants is a nursing home. I am told time and again by many elderly people that all they want is their own corner where they are lord and master. It is not much to ask and it is the least the State can do to give support to the people that are prepared to help to make that possible. In those cases the Carer's Leave Bill comes into play.</P>
    <P>The 12 or 15 month period provided for is short and the problem will still be there afterwards. It cannot be left open-ended but can we say three years or five years? Three years is reasonable and in that period things can happen and adjustments can be made. Other members of the family can perhaps play their part.</P>
    <P>On the issues raised by Deputy McCormack, the Minister and I have often spoken about them in the corridors of the House, and he, too, realises that the qualifying restrictions are more of a problem in rural Ireland than in urban Ireland. In a rural setting the house is isolated. In an urban setting one has neighbours in close proximity and communities can come together and do more. In a rural setting, however, there is a major problem.</P>
    <P>On the qualifying restrictions and the proximity to the household from which the caring is offered, five miles is not a great distance for cars. I know people who want to offer this facility to an old couple. They live five miles from the home of the old couple and are not accepted. They are prepared to be there in the morning at 9 a.m. and to stay until 9 p.m. That is a great gesture and yet the allowance will not be given due to the proximity to the home rule. It is not considered that the required attention could be given. They are there before the couple gets up in the morning and will be there when the couple goes to bed at night. That is a good service and it means that those old people can stay in their home and that they are safe. The State, however, says &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The carers are not living close enough. In a rural setting it is not easy to get people in that close proximity.</P>
    <P>It is time we examined more closely the qualifying limitations and the income limitations. It is time to do away with income-related caring. If people are prepared to offer caring there should not be any restrictions on qualifying income.</P>
    <P>There is an example in the farming community, of a 40 acre farm where the husband has had a stroke and the wife wishes to care for him. They were good farmers but that has changed. Production on the farm now will be greatly restricted. The type of farming must change and yet carer's allowance will not be paid. People in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs do not, or do not want to understand. It is simply the bottom line or it is income related.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack referred to old age pensioners and said that, when one reaches pension age, carer's allowance will be deducted. I do not accept that. We are being menial. We should be positive in doing something that will give a lift to <Col N="122" /> people that do this great work for which there is a need.</P>
    <P>People are living longer and more elderly people will live within our communities. It is important that we keep abreast of that. We must be delighted for and welcome better conditions in households, better diet and better medical facilities. The problem will be ongoing and at the other end of the scale there are young people who must get on with their lives.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Carer's Leave Bill is a step in the right direction but it is not the total answer to what is a major and serious problem. It is one of the problems I deal with in my constituency clinics on a regular, weekly basis. It is not the same families, but new families who come in.</P>
    <P>Nursing homes are sprouting up all over the place and, though they are a welcome development, they are more of a commercial development. People see it as an opportunity to get into a business. They are doing a good job, I am not against what they are doing but it is not the solution.</P>
    <P>We should wonder whether, when our day comes, someone will march us off to a nursing home and that will be it. That is not what we want. That is not what elderly people want. Let us put ourselves in their place and think how they think. Let us not say to them that we know what is good for them. We do not. They themselves know what they want. They want their independence. They want to stay where they grew up or where they have been resident for years. They want to spend their last days in reasonable comfort. They do not talk about palaces or anything extraordinary but something that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>In a tiger economy, if it is to be all-inclusive, these people must be included. Otherwise we are neglecting the people who built this State, and gave us the country we can now cherish and live in and in which there is so much to offer. We should not forget those who did it for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It has been on the drawing board for quite some time at this stage, approximately 15 months, at least.</P>
      <P>The carer's benefit was announced in the budget of December 1999 and the carer's benefit came into force in October 2000. People have been in receipt of carer's benefit for the past four months or so. It was made clear in the Budget Statement a year ago that legislation would be introduced to deal with carer's leave which is a separate issue from carer's benefit or carer's allowance. The legislation, which is being brought forward by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, deals with employment rights. People might find it confusing to hear us talk about employment rights when we are speaking about carer's benefit. However, it is important to give legislative backing to those who wish to return to work having opted for carer's leave and carer's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this was first mentioned people thought <Col N="123" /> it was revolutionary. We are perhaps one of the first countries in Europe to go down this road and it is something about which we can hold our head high. The reason we can be proud is that we are showing the world at large that we are helping those who wish to care for elderly people in their home. The Bill does not just copperfasten existing rights but establishes new entitlements. We are breaking new ground in this area. There will be new legal entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid carer's leave to care for a relevant person, that is, one who is in need of full-time care. It must be stressed that there is no cost to the employer. It is unpaid leave and the employer does not have to make any contribution towards it. However, it could cause disruption in the workplace, especially in the case of small companies where it is difficult to replace key staff at short notice, particularly when the employee will be returning to work after a period. The Exchequer will finance the cost in cases where a person qualifies for carer's benefit.</P>
    <P>Many people ask why we are introducing this now. Many years ago, a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Woods, was the first to introduce the concept of a carer's allowance. There was a realisation that many people wished to be cared for in their home environment rather than in an institution. In some instances there were insufficient places in institutions but, be that as it may, many people prefer to be cared for at home. The carer's allowance was introduced on a small scale but it has grown and last year more than 16,000 people were in receipt of the allowance. That is a big increase on the number availing of it three years ago when we came to office. I know that some say many more people should be included but we are making modest progress, perhaps not at a level which I or those in my constituency would be satisfied with, but nevertheless it is reasonable and further progress was made in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>When we entered Government three years ago there were 1.3 million people in the workforce. There are now 1.7 million. As there are an additional 300,000 people in employment they may not be in a position to avail of carer's allowance so it is necessary to expand the carer's allowance scheme to include those who are in employment and wish to take time off to care for a family member who may have a medical condition following a car accident, a stroke and so on or for an elderly relative. As so many people are now at work we must ensure our employment policy is family orientated and show we are a caring society. We cannot ignore the family circumstances of the 1.7 million people who are helping to create this strong economy from which we all benefit.</P>
    <P>Most people prefer to be cared for in their home. We have a strong economy and it would be very poor if people did not have a quality of life with which they were happy. This is a measure that will help to improve the quality of <Col N="124" /> life of many households. I hope the carer's benefit and carer's allowance schemes will be dovetailed. The Minister indicated earlier that the reason for the four month delay in introducing the legislation was to ensure the carer's leave scheme was dovetailed into the carer's benefit scheme. That scheme is in operation for four months and it is necessary to have co-ordination between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure the scheme works properly to benefit those for whom it was designed and not cause any unnecessary bureaucratic headaches although, inevitably, there will be difficulties.</P>
    <P>Being entitled to carer's leave does not necessarily mean you are entitled to carer's benefit and <i>vice versa</i>. That conundrum is confusing but it must be realised that there is separate legislation designed for different purposes. It will dovetail as much as possible but there are points of difference between the legislation. It is not fully reconcilable in all cases. When people understand the scheme they will appreciate what is involved. As I understand it, the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, a person can qualify for carer's leave but not qualify for carer's benefit. In cases where they have more than 12 months' continuous employment with their current employer they can qualify for carer's leave but if they do not satisfy the PRSI regulations they will not qualify for carer's benefit. That can occur in exceptional circumstances. In such cases it is open to a person who qualifies for carer's leave under this legislation to apply for carer's allowance. It is important to stress that. If they are not in receipt of carer's benefit, have given up their job, do not have an income, and provide full-time care they will be subject to a means test and, I am sure in practically all cases, will qualify for carer's allowance. They could have the benefit of carer's leave and carer's allowance. People will not mind what the allowance is called at the end of the day if they receive the benefit of the payment while they are out of work.</P>
    <P>A person may qualify for carer's benefit but not for carer's leave. In such cases people may meet the PRSI contributions but may be only recently in a new job and not meet the 12 months' continuous employment with their current employer. It would be difficult for an employer having taken on a new employee to give carer's leave, particularly in a small company. We must strike a balance between the rights of employees and employers. Prior to the legislation being finalised, there were detailed discussions with the employers' representatives, IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representing the social partners. That is why the legislation is so good. In such cases, people will qualify for carer's benefit but will not meet the employment criteria. That is an anomaly in the legislation. It is important that when the information leaflets are published and made available through employment offices, and especially social welfare offices, <Col N="125" /> people understand the difference between these two matters. I am sure the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would not normally do this but when people are being sent their annual tax free allowances from the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps an explanatory leaflet on these issues could be included in the envelope. This leave is of greatest benefit to people who are currently in employment but they would have no reason to call into local employment exchanges or social welfare offices so they would not get the information leaflets that tend to be available in those locations. Perhaps the best way of communicating with them would be to enclose a leaflet with their annual tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>When we go to the trouble of enacting legislation in the House, it is important to ensure that as many people as possible know about it and have the opportunity to avail of the new schemes we are introducing, but they can only avail of them if they have knowledge of them. There is an onus on the Department to ensure the public are fully informed of this new scheme, which I believe is breaking new ground.</P>
    <P>I heard Opposition Deputies complain earlier about the carer's benefit and they talked about people having X amount of income or land. Carer's benefit is not means tested; that is the essence of this scheme. Carer's allowance is means tested. The comments made across the floor were valid in respect of carer's allowance but it would be wrong to send out a misleading message from this House that people will have difficulty qualifying for the carer's benefit if they have an income. Carer's benefit is earned by way of a person's PRSI contribution; it is not means tested so it is important to state that.</P>
    <P>I know of two cases in my constituency where people applied and were approved for carer's benefit before Christmas but who came to me asking about their entitlement to carer's leave. I know the Minister said that some employers have been taking a compassionate and pragmatic approach and allowing people to take up carer's leave pending finalisation of the carer's leave legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I hope the legislation will pass through the Houses and that the 200 people who have already got the carer's benefit since last October will automatically qualify for the carer's leave entitlement provided they are entitled to it in the normal course of events. Perhaps the Minister will provide some clarification on what I would call these transitional measures, later in the debate because more than 200 people are caught in the trap of having obtained the carer's benefit but are now waiting for this legislation to pass through the Houses. The intention of the Government is clear-cut. We want to assist these people but it would be beneficial if the Minister would make a clear statement on that aspect during the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The benefit being introduced depends on the level of income that a person is currently earning. <Col N="126" /> Some people will say it is not very generous but it is a good start. This benefit did not exist four months ago but now, as a result of the most recent budget, the carer's benefit will be £95.50 per week if the person is caring for one person. Where a person is caring for a second individual, there is a 50% increase on that figure. There is also a £13.20 child dependant allowance per week for a person on carer's benefit. The carer will obtain the £400 respite care per person and if caring for two people, will receive a respite payment of £800 and, as happens in some of these cases, if the person being cared for dies, the carer's benefit continues for an additional six weeks. That is a good measure.</P>
    <P>I realise this question is a matter for the Department of Finance but it is important when dealing with legislation which has an impact on other Departments. Will people in receipt of carer's benefit now be able to avail of the special tax free allowance of £300 introduced in last year's budget for a stay at home spouse who is providing full-time care and attention to an elderly or a young person in the home? I presume that a person out of work who is providing full-time care at home, notwithstanding the fact that he or she is in receipt of carer's benefit, would be entitled to the carer's tax free allowance but that is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to clarify. It would be beneficial, however, if the Minister could clarify that point also because my understanding is that the carer would be entitled to both.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, as I mentioned earlier, is £98.50 plus a child dependant allowance of £13.20 and the £400 respite care, but people in receipt of carer's allowance also avail of all the free schemes which are a normal feature of social welfare legislation. Some people who qualify under the Carer's Leave Bill but who, because of some PRSI contribution issues, do not get the carer's benefit may have to apply for the carer's allowance. It is important in that respect that we increased in the budget the income disregard for a person from £75 to £125. That amount of income is disregarded and they can still qualify for the full carer's allowance. In the case of a couple, those figures are doubled from £150 to £250 so a couple earning £12,000 or £14,000 can still qualify for the full carer's allowance. Families earning up to £19,000 will be entitled to some element, even though it will be a reduced amount of carer's allowance. That is important.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead we will see the number of carers increasing because the population is getting older and more people want to be cared for at home. The Carers Association currently provides assistance to people in the community who are providing full-time care.</P>
    <P>In relation to the carer's leave scheme, the key conditions for a person applying for carer's leave will be that they should care for an appropriate person and there will be one medical examination for the carer's leave and carer's benefit. It is important that the person from social welfare car<Col N="127" /> ries out one examination to fulfil both schemes. The acknowledgement from the Department of Social Welfare that an application has been received will be an adequate notice for an employee to present to his employer to indicate that he intends to apply for the carer's leave scheme in a six week period. The person must also be in continuous employment for 12 months with that employer and this can operate up to 15 months, which is very extensive.</P>
    <P>There has to be a balance from the employer's point of view and an employer has the right to refuse carer's leave for a period of under 13 weeks. That is to ensure that small employments can continue to function adequately. Also, on resumption of employment a person should be allowed to return to his or her previous work and if that is not possible, he or she must be brought back on terms and conditions not less favourable than their previous conditions.</P>
    <P>My concerns are that the medical assessments will be carried out promptly. Also, if there is to be an appeals period, it should not be dealt with by the social welfare appeals office because that will take months. There should be a fast-track system for this area. I acknowledge the difficulties this will cause for employers. The Bill is modelled on the Parental Leave Act, 1998, which is working very successfully. This is the first Bill of its kind in Europe and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for introducing it. It is an important Bill which recognises the role of carers and the need for families in certain circumstances to leave work to care for a loved one. We have had an increase in the number of carers in recent years as well as a recognition of carers. Prior to that we did not recognise or accept the fabulous work done by families for their loved ones, the elderly, those with disabilities and those who are ill. There is a growing recognition that people with a physical or mental disability should be kept out of institutional care and be cared for instead in the community for as long as possible. Any measure which encourages the development of the carer's scheme and responds to the needs of carers is to be welcomed. The number of carers will increase dramatically in the coming years. In 25 years approximately half of the population of Europe will have reached retirement age, while there will be an increase of 50% in the number of retired people in this State. The Bill goes some way towards recognising this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a good start in recognising that families must be given the opportunity to care for their loved ones at home. In the past, people were more amenable to doing this but due to economic pressures most couples now work outside the home and there is less opportunity for caring at home. We all know people, particularly women, who stayed at home to care for their ageing parents. They missed out on many of life's experi<Col N="128" /> ences, while many of them did not get married. These great people were not given proper recognition for their work, while sometimes they were scoffed at by people who did not know better. Nowadays it is difficult from a financial point of view for people to stay at home to care for their relatives. In addition, many people do not accept that they should miss out on life's experiences. I agree with them. We must look at other ways of ensuring that people in need of care receive it without having to be admitted to institutions.</P>
    <P>Carers provide a high level of care at home for children with severe disabilities, frail elderly people and those who are terminally ill. Why will a carer's leave be terminated after 15 months? What will happen in the case of a person who takes time off work to care for someone who is very ill with cancer? I know people who took leave to care for a terminally ill relative who lived longer than 15 months. I did not see a provision which enables the leave to be extended for an extra period. Will people in such a difficult situation have to leave their loved one and return to work if they do not want to lose their jobs? Is that the stark choice which has to be made by a person who has cared for 15 months for somebody nearing the end of his life? </P>
    <P>Due to the high levels of social and health care needed, carers must be constantly available at home and in cases of emergency. A person who has become a semi-invalid after a stroke requires much care and families have to ensure that they are not in any danger. I remember a case some years ago involving an elderly man in a wheelchair who was looked after at home by his elderly wife. She had a heart attack and fell into the fire and when he tried to rescue her he was also burned. It is important that carers are available to ensure the safety of the elderly, infirm, etc.</P>
    <P>A carer's life centres around the needs of the person requiring care. Many carers suffer from poor health as a result of the physical and emotional effects of providing a high level of long-term care. We must examine the issue of respite care and provide more respite places for carers so that they can get a break from the difficult job of caring.</P>
    <P>Research completed in recent months by the Western Health Board indicates that there are some 20,000 family carers in its area. If one takes the ten health board areas, this suggests that the total number of carers is more than 200,000. However, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs states that the number of carers receiving assistance is 49,000. This means there are 150,000 carers who do not receive any help or assistance. Given their special circumstances, the Minister must revisit the issue of means testing for carers at the first available opportunity. A special arrangement should be put in place for carers who give up work to care for a family member. The best way of doing this is to double the means test so that many more people qualify for a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the carers association which has <Col N="129" /> lobbied politicians on the issue of the means test. It regards it as an issue of justice that carers have an adequate standard of living and believes that the means test is one way of ensuring this. The National Voluntary Organisation of Family Carers in the Home has a national network of 36 care centres which provide information, advice, advocacy, training, research and home-based respite care services. It employs more than 130 people, with funding provided by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, FÁS and the health boards. It also receives corporate and voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>I refer to the provision of personal assistants for people with disabilities. Under this excellent scheme, which was provided through FÁS, people acted as personal assistants for those in need of assistance, most of whom were in wheelchairs. At a time when the Government is flush with money, serious consideration should be given to formalising this service for those who can benefit from it. I have seen the effect of personal assistance. I met representatives from the Centre for Independent Living from my constituency before the budget. They had some personal assistants with them and commented on the change in their quality of life and their opportunities for travelling. It was enormous and ensured they had some level of dignity, some level of mobility and enabled them to have what we would call a much more normal life.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, I note that the employee must have been in the continuous employment of the employer from whose employment the leave is to be taken for at least 12 months before he or she can commence leave. Why must that be the case? If the employee's husband or wife had a heart attack or contracted cancer or had a stroke, three, four or five months into the employment, the employee cannot avail of this. Should the need for care not be a priority? This area should be examined. Is the Minister suggesting that somebody who has a serious illness should be put into an institution until the carer has been 12 months in employment and that then they can be facilitated and given the space to bring the person out of the institution to be cared for. A previous speaker gave the example that somebody who has been in continuous employment for 20 years and changed employment within the past 12 months cannot take up the opportunity to care for an infirm person. I remember when one could not carry forward pension scheme benefits when one changed employment. In other words, benefit stopped when one changed employment. Nowadays there is the facility for continuation of pension scheme rights when one changes employment. Why could something similar not apply here? Could the time in previous employment be aggregated and constitute a half-way house in the interests of being fair and allowing a person the opportunity to provide care.</P>
    <P>I note that carer's leave is unpaid but reckonable for the purposes of employment rights <Col N="130" /> except for superannuation and certain public holidays. Is it not a bit mean that these two areas have been excluded, and will the Minister examine this area? Under many company pay schemes superannuation and public holidays are taken into account as part of the benefits of the various sickness schemes for people who are on sick leave from employment. Could a similar approach not be taken here so that superannuation and public holidays would be reckonable in the case of the carer.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide that at least six weeks' prior notice in writing is required from the employee, except where not reasonably practicable, in which case notice should be given as soon as is reasonably practicable. Does that mean where a person has had a stroke or a severe accident? I was talking to somebody today whose wife fell down the stairs and broke her spine and is in constant pain. Does somebody have to give six weeks' notice in order to avail of the opportunity to care for a relative in such circumstances? Perhaps the Minister would clarify the phrase &ldquo;except where not reasonably practicable&rdquo;. Would the example I gave be considered to be a case where it would not be reasonably practicable to give six week's written notice?</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that where on resumption of work following a period of carer's leave it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit the employee to return to the same work as he or she did prior to leave, suitable alternative work on terms and conditions not less favourable to the employee than those applicable to his own or his previous employment should be provided by the employer. As somebody who was involved in personnel management and industrial relations for 20 years, I know this is an area where everybody leaving a job would be very anxious to return to the same position. As far as possible people should be allowed to do so. I was on the Employment Appeals Tribunal for nine years and I have seen situations where employers took exception to somebody taking leave and, on their return to work, gave them a position where they were not happy and the employers knew they were not happy. Because of the leave, the employer felt the employee was a cost to him and might be out again on sick leave or maternity leave, and the employee was constructively dismissed. I have seen such cases brought to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I have known people who went back to their office to find nothing in it, not even a telephone, and told their conditions were the same, their pension entitlements, their emoluments. They were given a small piece of work and their morale was destroyed and they were constructively dismissed. We must ensure that this sort of approach is not tolerated. I know the reply will be that it would be taken care of under the Unfair Dismissals Act. To a certain extent it is, but the human tragedy of it is the Unfair Dismissals Act comes into play six or eight months after the employee has left the employment, by which time the relationship <Col N="131" /> between the employer and the employee has totally broken down and the employee probably does not want to return to an employer who treated him in such a fashion. I would like the Minister, therefore, to tease out a little more in his reply how a carer returning to work will not experience such a situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The old and the ill deserve dignity. They like to be able to stay at home. They should be facilitated in every way possible. This Bill goes some way towards achieving that. If a carer takes ten or 12 months' leave and the person for whom he is caring improves in health but six months further on his health deteriorates, can the employee commence a 35 week period of carer's leave? </P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000. I am making my contribution in tribute to the many thousands of carers who are making such a difference to the huge number that are looked after by carers throughout the country. In this materialistic age the concept of the extended family with grandparents, parents and children living in a close family unit is fast fading. There is severe difficulty in getting young people or more mature people, or any people, to volunteer for work with people in need, political organisations or other voluntary bodies. That this year has been deemed the year of the volunteer indicates the difficulty we have generally in recruiting volunteers. Carers in the caring profession have developed from a voluntary basis. However, matters have changed. Ireland is developing a solid economic base. The nuclear family is the norm and we must recognise the work and efforts of carers and improve the current benefits and allowances available to them, which are not fully satisfactory. This Bill is a significant step in that direction.</P>
      <P>Carers often have a lonely, thankless job, and that is the position for some more than others. The Carers Association of Ireland put it very well when it stated that caring for a severely incapacitated person at home is not easy. Carers can often have conflicting feelings and emotions. They can feel a deep sense of satisfaction in doing a very important job of work at home, which maintains the independence and dignity of the person being cared for. The carer can also feel the work he or she is doing at home is unrecognised and unappreciated and, depending on family circumstances, attitudes within the home can vary from supportive words and actions to lack of interest to criticism of the carer and the quality of care being provided. The relationship between the carer and the person being cared for varies from case to case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Factors affecting the relationship between both include the nature of the relationship, whether daughter and mother, son and mother, mother and child, and so on, and the quality of the relationship before the caring situation arose. <Col N="132" /> Issues centred on the control exercised by one party over the other can be crucial. The need for the carer to assist the cared for person in independent living must be balanced with the expectations of both and the perceptions of both of the role of carer. There may be a tendency for one party to exert control over the other party.</P>
    <P>The context in which the caring takes place is important. For example, if the carer has to give up work to care for someone at home, the financial strains of being a carer, expressed or implied longer term financial benefits for the carer, such as understandings on property inheritance rights, and many other hidden factors can come into the equation. Also important are the caring duties involved and the health of the carer. The physical and emotional stresses caused by very intensive long-term care at home can be high. Many carers suffer a range of physical and emotional difficulties and, in some cases, serious deterioration in the carer's own health.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on the maintenance of employment rights in the Bill will take a good deal of the worry and burden off carers in relation to what will happen to them when their caring task or burden is done. Often the task of caring arises out of the blue. It is beneficial for the person concerned to have 65 weeks in which to plan to return to one's career and to work out the financial aspects of caring for a loved person and maybe to arrange for other more appropriate care. The initial feeling of a person at work when something happens to a relative is not to protect his or her job or employment rights, but one of a deep hurt and pain because that person's relative is in pain.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) provides that before making regulations under this Act, the Minister shall consult the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and persons whom the Minister considers to be representative of employment and employees having regard to the regulations so made. I am glad the Minister is taking on board the concerns of the employers as well as the employees. Deputy Ring pointed out the difficulty employers with one or two employees may experience in terms of the provisions of the Bill. I ask that the concerns of such employers be taken on board and that they be consulted when these regulations are being made.</P>
    <P>Section 3(5) provides that the Minister, after consultation with any other Minister, who, in the opinion of the Minister, might be concerned with the matter, may by regulations exempt from the application of a specified provision or provisions of this Act persons employed in any specified class or classes of activity. We need to be careful such special treatment is accorded only to employments where there are absolutely necessary circumstances. It may be necessary to be more specific in this section to ensure there is not a wide exemption included in it.</P>
    <P>Section 4(3) provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the inclusion in an agreement of a provision more favourable to <Col N="133" /> an employee than any provisions in Parts 2 to 5. This is a great challenge in terms of employer-employee contracts to push out the boundaries of our social economy. The country is developing economically and this is an opportunity for employers to develop the social content of employment contracts. I look forward to innovative improvements by employers whereby they will take on board some of the care responsibilities of their employees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville referred to the requirement in section 6(1) that an employee applying for carer's leave must be in continuous employment for 12 months. While I accept his comments, some concern must be given to the continuity of a business and the impact employee's carer's leave may have on the other employees. On that basis the 12 months' continuous employment requirement is a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>Section 6(5) provides that an employee who proposes to avail of carer's leave shall apply to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for a decision by a deciding officer under the Act of 1993 and that the person in respect of whom the employee proposes to avail of carer's leave in order to provide full-time care and attention is a relevant person. Judgment must be exercised in that regard. The full picture must be examined in deciding whether the person to be cared for is a relevant person. Broad criteria are needed to take account not only of who is the person to be cared for but the relationship between the proposed carer and the person to be cared for on the basis that certain carers may be in a better position to give more tender loving care to the person who needs it and the result may be better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4) provides that carer's leave shall not exceed 130 weeks. That is a long time and an element we will have to consider in the employer-employee relationship. The continued employment of a person after 121 weeks in today's rapidly evolving technologically based companies may pose insoluble problems. It may be unfair to allow unfair dismissal procedures to be followed in this type of case. I do not have the full answer, but we must address that, particularly in light of the type of industries here and that are being attracted here. Implementing that provision could be a heavy burden for a business or an employer to adopt and use.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Code of Conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday, 6 February 2001.</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;aware that Article 15.10 of the Consti<Col N="134" /> tution enables each House of the Oireachtas to make its own rules and standing orders, with powers to attach penalties for their infringement, that such rules may extend to matters relating to the conduct and discipline of Members as well as the procedures of the House, but that rules of such a nature have yet to be adopted by this House;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;further aware that recent controversies involving Members of this House have highlighted the absence of such powers;</P>
    <P Just="Center">approves, in principle, the adoption of a code of conduct for its Members;</P>
    <P Just="Center">refers the draft code, as laid before Dáil Éireann on 1 February 2001, to the Committee on Members' Interests for its consideration, both as regards the content of the code and in relation to its implementation and enforcement (including in particular any amendment which may be required to the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, in relation to the proposed function of the committee under the code); and </P>
    <P Just="Center">instructs that committee to report its recommendations in the matter to this House not later than 1 May 2001.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To add the following to the motion:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;and in supporting the principles included in the proposed code of conduct before the House and its referral to the Committee on Members' Interests, further instructs the committee that it has power to draft a code of conduct consistent with that envisaged in the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, and to consider submissions from Oireachtas Members and political parties, including the proposed code before the House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;[Minister of State at the Department of Finance].</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said a code of conduct should not be necessary &ndash; and would not be &ndash; in an ideal world. A code of conduct should be in the hearts of those in public life but we are not in an ideal world and that is why we are debating this motion. A small minority of people in public office have made this debate necessary.</P>
      <P>We should be proud of our privileged position and that we have been elected to serve in public office. We should defend the role of the public representative and those in public office against the current perception that tars us all with the same brush. This perception has arisen because of the actions of a tiny minority of people in public office and it is unfortunate that we all suffer as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke last night about the scrutiny we are under and that is true. The <Col N="135" /> final date for Members to submit declarations of presents and so on was 29 January and those declarations will make up a document for public scrutiny. Yesterday all Members received notification to declare any interests in property and those results will also be open to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that more information about those in public office is now available under the Freedom of Information Act. Last week all Oireachtas Members were notified that a Sunday newspaper was looking at Members' expenses under the Freedom of Information Act. That is legitimate but some fairness should come into it. Nobody seems to point out that expenses have to be legitimately incurred and information about expenses is provided under an unfair system that seriously discriminates against some Members.</P>
    <P>The legitimate expenses incurred by Ministers and Ministers of State by having drivers provided and being paid mileage, for example, is not disclosed alongside the expenses of Members who are not Ministers or Ministers of State. In some constituencies, such as my own, the majority of Members are in Cabinet and there is serious discrimination against those who are not in that happy position, as when expenses are published under the Freedom of Information Act those figures are taken up by the local media. The figures are simply listed out because generally speaking reporters are quite lazy and reprint what they get as they are given it. This discriminates seriously against those who are not Ministers, as Deputies are reported as having been given a certain amount while Ministers' legitimate expenses are not given.</P>
    <P>There is further discrimination against Members who have constituency offices. The expense of running a constituency office is not clarified and a Member with such an office will have his or her expenses compared to a Member with no constituency office but a secretary in Dublin. There is no comparison between the expenses. Although the concession is that one has the same facility regarding a secretary, a Member must provide an office and I challenge anyone to guess how much it costs to provide and run a full-time constituency office. That is clear discrimination.</P>
    <P>When we discuss a code of conduct for those in public office we should realise that there is much unfair reporting which gives an impression that downgrades our position and leads to the popular view that we are all in the one boat. I support the Labour Party motion but a motion will not change legislation. It is just an opportunity to debate matters but from that point of view it may convey to the Government the necessity of drawing up a code of conduct. I regret that it is necessary to draw up a code of conduct for our behaviour in public office as such a code of conduct is already being observed by the majority of Members.</P>
    <P>There should be a code of conduct in every <Col N="136" /> aspect of life such as families and schools and not just public life. We should establish a code of conduct for our children at the earliest age possible and then, whether those children enter public life or not, they would know they have a code of conduct to live up to. That is the approach I would take: establishing a correct code of conduct for people in all walks of life as well as those in public office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion as amended and having listened carefully to the earlier contributions, it is clear there is broad cross-party support for moving ahead on an all-party basis towards an agreed and enforceable code of conduct for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Recent events have highlighted the need for us as elected Members of the Dáil to be enthusiastic and proactive in this regard. However, this does not mean we should be driven only by the politics of the last scandal as interpreted by the media or elsewhere or that we should as a group buy into the now common assertion that all of us are tainted by the acts or omissions of a few. I, and I am sure many Members agree, do not accept a vicarious responsibility for the misconduct of a handful of Deputies over the years who have acted improperly or in a way that brings the Dáil and our profession of politics into disrepute. If we start to accept that populist and anti-intellectual nonsense, we will only contribute to the debasement of politics.</P>
      <P>During the debate last night, there was predictable, unfortunate and misplaced criticism of the Government for not taking the initiative on a code for Members. The Executive has no function in determining the rules of procedure of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that this is a matter for each House. In any event, far from being remiss in the area of ethics in public life, the facts show that we have a detailed cohort of legislation across a broad spectrum. I refer in particular to the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Electoral Act and the Standards in Public Office Act, which, after consultation with committees of the House, envisages a code of conduct for Members. Other legislation in the pipeline relates to whistle blowers in addition to the Prevention of Corruption Bill, 2000, with proposed amendments to provide for the prevention, prosecution and punishment of corruption. The Local Government Bill, 2000, also proposes a comprehensive regime for local authorities, public registers of councillors and senior officials and codes of conduct for members and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion was understandably prompted by a perceived impotence on the part of the House <Col N="137" /> and the weakness of the current Standing Orders to act when a sitting Member was found to be in contempt of court and jailed accordingly. Members, and the public generally, were extremely frustrated that, notwithstanding a raft of ethical provisions on the Statute Book, there was no effective mechanism through which the House as Parliament could indicate its disapproval or sanction misconduct which fell short of criminality or insolvency. Some of us felt it was an inadequate response to say that the ultimate sanction lay with the electorate. It should be possible, even given the constitutional limitations, for us as elected Members to agree sanctions, short of expulsion. Other professions so regulate their members and we owe it to ourselves to at least consider this matter in depth and devise a reasonable and responsible regime.</P>
    <P>However, I am reluctant to outline at this stage an overly prescriptive or exhaustive formula. It is not appropriate for one party or an individual Deputy to declare what that code should be without an in-depth analysis politically and legally of the implications and workability of the proposed code. A major concern is the potential danger of the partisan use of the code by a majority in the Dáil against a minority. Safeguards must be built in to guard against this potential abuse of a code.</P>
    <P>Although the motion is valuable, a prolonged public debate on these issues, particularly in a party political climate, may feed into what has become a near obsession with political sleaze. The debate, therefore, should be purposeful, reasonable and finite if we are to avoid unduly diminishing the primacy of politics and the standing of the Dáil itself in the eyes of the public. While this debate was fuelled by embarrassment and frustration on the part of Deputies on all sides, arising from the misconduct of a particular Member, it is also properly motivated by a desire to protect the House as Parliament and an institution in our democracy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is the principal organ of accountability in our democracy. It is to the Dáil, and not to the Government or the Opposition, that Ministers and the Executive are accountable. None of the tribunals would have been necessary if the Dáil had been competent as a vehicle of accountability. If parliamentary questions had been honestly and completely answered, there would have been no need for the beef tribunal, the hepatitis C tribunal or other inquiries and the current tribunals which are dominating public life and discourse.</P>
    <P>The pathetic fact is that, unfortunately, Ministers in all Governments have misled the House. This perhaps is the most fundamental offence against Parliament. In some cases, civil servants and officials were necessarily and undoubtedly involved. Who can forget the note on the file in the Department of Agriculture, as disclosed in the beef tribunal, which stated in the margin of a reply to a parliamentary question &ldquo;That should confuse the Deputy&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>During my five years of experience in Oppo<Col N="138" /> sition of tabling questions to various Ministers and Departments, I was regularly in receipt of misleading, incomplete and evasive replies to parliamentary requests for information to which I was entitled. If we are talking about the primacy of the Dáil and ways to protect it and make it a sovereign organ of our democracy, independent of the Executive, the role of civil and public servants in replying to parliamentary questions is central. In this context, it is important to note that the Standards in Public Office Bill embraces the conduct of all persons in public life.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill accordingly provides that codes of conduct will be drawn up in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission by the Government in the case of office holders and the Minister for Finance in the case of public servants generally. In the case of Oireachtas Members, the Bill as published provides that a code of conduct will be drawn up by the commission in consultation with the relevant House of the Oireachtas, but can only be applied to Members by a resolution of the House. I understand the Minister will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that drafting the code will be done by the Select Committee on Members' Interests. It appears the provisions of the Bill have considerable consequences for the workings of our democratic institutions. The Bill also requires Oireachtas Members and the most senior public servants and judges to have tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>The passing of the motion, as amended, will be an important part of an ethics related reform process and demonstrates that the House, as distinct from the Government, is at one on the goal of achieving the highest standards in public life. In a way, this debate is part of a painful and exposing period in public affairs. Recent times have been demoralising for many of us involved in public life and the public generally. Many, if not all, our institutions have been found wanting in terms of accountability and honesty. The public interest has not come first; the Dáil, at times, has failed in its primary function. It was a scandal of enormous proportions that child abuse, state neglect of citizens in respect of the hepatitis C scandal and maladministration was concealed from the public and the Dáil for too long. Many individuals' lives were damaged or destroyed as a result.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has had some limited success in revealing and punishing wrongdoing by the State and its institutions. Those of us in Opposition and the Executive are first and foremost Members of the Dáil; our first allegiance is to the people through the House and perhaps this should be the first commandment in any new proposed code of conduct. If we as representatives of the people lose sight of the basic principle that we are first and foremost Members of the Dáil, the role of the House could be gradually eroded. It is our job as elected Members to defend the Dáil and the primacy of politics. We must, however, be careful not to unwittingly undermine the integrity of democratic politics by a party political debate or <Col N="139" /> by parroting the clichés of cynical elements in the media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Roche, Killeen, Fleming and Conor Lenihan.</P>
      <P>I have thought about ethics over the past few days. Indeed, I was given every encouragement to do so by remarks made about me in the House, even if they were wildly inaccurate shots from an angry Parthian on a slipping saddle. I did not like what was said. In 22 years as a public representative, I have done nothing to warrant investigation by a tribunal, as was suggested, and I regret the privilege of this House was used to punish me for views which I honestly held. However, what was said was said openly. It was not whispered behind my back in the corridors. If it was uncalled for, it also gives me the opportunity to look my accuser in the eye and tell him he is wrong, and I am doing that now. Many Members were angry during that debate. Indeed, I was far from pleased, but I am concerned that we could over-react to what has been happening over the past few years. I do not want to have to carry a rulebook under my arm in the House.</P>
      <P>We were elected because the public felt that we could be trusted to make laws. I wonder if lawmakers need rules to keep them in line and if they do, whether they should be lawmakers. Do we need rules if the great majority can impose moral sanctions on the errant few on the odd occasion that this is necessary and we have the will to do so? Is it a problem that we would prefer rules to do that for us and if that is the case, will rules help? Last week, for instance, the Members of this House could have registered their disapproval by walking out <i>en masse</i>. I do not know the answers to these questions but we should debate them.</P>
      <P>I just wonder about a code of conduct. We are going through a phase in the history of this country &ndash; post-colonial, adolescence, wild west, call it what you will. We are on the cusp of a transition from the time when a stroke got you everything to a time where it gets you into hospital or jail. It is inevitable, it is traumatic but we are maturing and it will pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to introduce a code of conduct, we should do so fully conscious of all this and the fact that rules are frequently introduced after the great need for them has passed. The consequence is that we may bind the many unnecessarily to a narrow path after the need to curtail the few is no longer pressing. Also we need to be sure about the message we are sending out about ourselves. For instance, one often hears the phrase &ldquo;removed from political influence&rdquo;. It is often used, even by politicians, as if some great good had been done. It simply means that this House has handed over the responsibility to someone else for fear that that responsibility would be abused. There are many examples to be found of this in local government and in health and it is <Col N="140" /> perhaps the reason for half the bureaucratic nonsense in this country, but it says a great deal about what politicians think about themselves or have been persuaded to think about themselves.</P>
    <P>Integrity, idealism, duty and public service are alive and well here. The will to do good, make a difference and create a better Ireland motivates the vast majority of our politicians. We should remind ourselves of that and draw strength and confidence from it.</P>
    <P>The public know we are human. In fact, they have a clear idea about wrongdoing and human frailty, and they understand that these are often entwined. They understand also that there is a change of culture occurring, with all the trauma which that has brought, and I think they are becoming uneasy about the amount of time we are spending on washing, dirty linen, however necessary it is.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a code of conduct is necessary but one must remember that we are not schoolboys and the public do not expect us to be saints. They expect us to give leadership. What we really need to do, and what I think the public would like to see us do, is to stand up for our vocation, rebuild our pride and courage, set aside inter-party point scoring about the past and get on with doing our best to make the future better for everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the previous speaker for sharing the limited time available. I welcome this debate which should have taken place a number of years ago. In the dark days of December 1994, when a group of us from the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party were trying to save a Government which was on its last gasp, I proposed that a standing ethics commission on politics be created, that it would be independent of this House and independently funded, and that it should have a strong investigative role.</P>
      <P>Politics has not been served well in the recent past and certainly it is not served by the kind of petty point scoring which we have heard. We are at a crossroads in politics. I asked a group of young students who I brought in here today from St. David's school in Greystones whether any of them were interested in politics and not one of those vibrant, vital young people was. If politics is to be killed by cynicism and by the corruption of a few, this country and democracy will suffer.</P>
      <P>What should we do? Earlier the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, spoke of the Standards in Public Office Bill and it was referred to last night. I wish that Bill a quick introduction into this House and a very speedy passage, but the question is not of a code of ethics. Most of us know what is right and what is wrong. The question is: how will that code be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the oldest questions in democracy is: who guards the guardians, who judges the judges? Juvenal, the Roman poet, asked that question. Last week when I was talking about the proposed judicial commission, I suggested that it would be bad to have judges judge themselves and I believe it is also bad to have politicians judge themselves. <Col N="141" /> I would like to see not only a strong code but one which will be enforced by an independent commission, a Standards in Public Office Commission or whatever we will call it.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a few points before the House. That commission must have three fundamental elements. First and foremost, it must be independent of this and other institutions. This House cannot judge itself, nor can it really judge its Members. We have gone through a great deal of nonsense in the recent past about what committees of this House can and cannot do. The truth is that we cannot judge ourselves. The public perception is that we are not fit to do that job. We need an independent agency to do that. It must be independent, institutionally and in the perception of the public. Second, it needs to be powerful in the true sense. It must be powerful with the capacity to enforce its views and its findings and whatever code is agreed commonly. Third, it must be resourced and staffed. It must have an investigative capacity and a substantial budget, and I will deal with that later when we come to the Standards in Public Office Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of a code because the concern about what has happened to politics and the low ebb of politicians is not confined to any one side in this House. I left a job in the public service many years ago to serve the public in a different way through politics and I know many of my colleagues on all sides of the House are also motivated, not by money, personal wealth, personal ambition or even by the pursuit of office, but by a sense of public service. It is time that we combined our forces to ensure that we have an institutional framework, in which we can express that interest and in which we can deal with those few people who transgress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Members' Interest, to which this code is being referred, has already recommended the adoption of same in a report a little over a year ago. Two members of the committee spoke last night and indicated that it was quite a difficult job, but we will certainly undertake it if that is the wish of the House.</P>
      <P>Aristotle, in <i>Politics and Ethics</i>, presents a coherent classical account of the relationship between politics and ethics. It is interesting to look back on the work of Aristotle and Plato quite a long time ago and the difficulties which had to be addressed by those who wanted to produce an ethical democracy before the advent of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had been speaking two years ago, I would have agreed with much of what Deputy Roche said but having had an opportunity to examine, in practice, the kind of commission he illustrated in at least one jurisdiction, the kind of adversarial situations which it produced in Parliament and in the media, and the increased levels of negativity towards parliamentarians it caused in that jurisdiction, the cost of it and many other factors, I would certainly shy away from going down that exact road, although I would go some of the way <Col N="142" /> and I know my colleagues on the committee would do likewise.</P>
    <P>When people see the title, Committee on Members' Interests, they assume it is charged with improving conditions for Members. It would be much better if it were called the Committee on Ethics or something which would bring to mind to people exactly what its business entails.</P>

      <P>Certainly. Those of us who are members of the committee who have had reason to examine the experience elsewhere have been shocked at the shenanigans engaged in by people in other jurisdictions. Even the worst matters being investigated here do not compare in terms of seriousness. Nevertheless, anyone might be forgiven for thinking that the public has scant knowledge of what is happening in national or local politics other than scandal. Even in Parliament we tend to have a very narrow focus on ethics, looking for evidence of bribery in its various manifestations. We need to face up to the fact that the focus has been too narrow and frequently badly directed. There is widespread denigration of politicians caused by the ethical shortcomings of relatively few and that is something which is agreed by all parties in the House. Nevertheless, it is a driving force towards creating a legislative environment and a situation where codes of practice would be introduced and implemented.</P>
      <P>However, it will take much more than codes to address our difficulties. One of the fundamental considerations must be that the right resides with the electorate to send people here. In a sense, we set ourselves a very difficult task in that we have no choice about who comes, but it is a task we must confront and it is a task this parliamentary democracy has been very slow to address.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that one of the reasons is that there is not a tradition of the separation of the duties of the parliamentarian and the Parliament from that of the Executive. The system under which we operate ensures little more than half the Members of Parliament are predisposed to not being critical of the actions of the Executive. That applies equally regardless of which parties are in power. The most fundamental requirement of this Parliament is that it acts as a Parliament for the people and makes the Executive answerable in some of the ways illustrated by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and by others who spoke last night and tonight. It is the most fundamental weakness of this Parliament that we have not set about in an adult manner establishing answerability in the House. It is the cheapest place in which to do it and it would benefit the State most.</P>

The facts are that the Labour Party is the greatest offender in attempting to buy votes and I will prove that.</P>
      <P>Since the previous general election, which was not fought under expenditure limits, five by-elections have been fought with strict election expenditure limits. In the course of those five by-elections, Fianna Fáil has spent £1.88 on every vote obtained in those.</P>

I regret I was not in the House yesterday evening to hear the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who is present in the House, but I read it during the course of the day. It read a little like the confessions of St. Augustine, albeit without the salacious bits. It was a case of, &ldquo;Lord make us good, but not yet&rdquo;. The Minister of State indicated what the Government proposes to do to reform politics. It has been in office almost four years, during which it has voted down many of the reforming measures proposed initially by the Labour Party and which the Minister of State now claims will be introduced by the Government.</P>

The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is to introduce reforming measures for local authorities. He has not yet introduced the Local Government Bill, 2000, published last May for debate in the House while the Standards in Public Office Bill is still awaiting Committee Stage. Although we have been informed that there will be amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, to which I will return, they have not yet been circulated. The Prevention of Corruption Bill, which is still awaiting Committee Stage, could have been dealt with if the Labour Party Bill on the same area had been accepted. Apparently, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is also to introduce amendments to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill which was introduced initially by Deputy Rabbitte.

      <P>I am pleased the motion in the name of the Labour Party has been accepted by the Government. Its response, however, has been <Col N="147" /> half-hearted and, in many respects, two-faced in respect of many of the reforming measures being considered. For example, last June the House debated the Labour Party's Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill which had, as one of its principal objectives, the imposition of a ban on corporate donations to parties or candidates. The Labour Party believes strongly that this reform is essential if the lessons of the tribunals are to be learned and we are to begin the process of restoring confidence in the political system. Rather than directly oppose the Bill, the Government parties tabled an amendment which provided that the Bill was deemed to have passed Second Stage on 1 December. On 14 December, under pressure from the Labour Party, the Government agreed to pass a motion referring the Bill to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of January I requested the chairperson of the committee, Deputy Healy Rae, to schedule the Bill for consideration by the committee. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has now written to Deputy Healy Rae, however, requesting that the committee consider the Government's electoral Bill, which includes the controversial proposals to increase spending limits at elections by up to 50% before it discusses the Labour Party Bill. The Minister justifies his request by referring to the fact that the Government has promised to publish amendments to the electoral Bill which will provide for a limit, but not a ban on corporate donations.</P>
      <P>I regard this intervention by the Minister as a serious attempt to overturn a decision of the Dáil and interfere in the work of the committee. The Government is effectively attempting to bury the Labour Party Bill which was mysteriously omitted from the list of legislation before the Dáil published on 25 January by the Government Chief Whip. The Labour Party intends to fight the Minister's interference and I am insisting that the chairperson of the committee, Deputy Healy Rae, allow the committee to consider the Bill at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>In its attempt to block our Bill and push through legislation which will allow Fianna Fáil to spend an additional £1 million at the next election, the Government has shown that it has no interest in trying to clean up politics.

      <P>This morning the Taoiseach confirmed on the Order of Business that the Government is blocking the Labour Party Bill and wants the House to consider instead its own electoral Bill which is intended to increase by £1 million the amount Fianna Fáil can spend at the next election. To have the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's Bill passed by the House the Government will require the support of the four Independent Deputies, Deputies Healy Rae, Fox, Gildea and Blaney. A Bill to allow Fianna Fáil to increase its electoral spending is hardly in the interests of independent Deputies whose capacity to raise political funds must be limited and whose seats, notwithstanding their support for the Government, will be targeted by Fianna Fáil at the next election. I am sure Fianna Fáil fundraisers are even now divvying up their additional £1 million and planning their election spending sprees in those constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the fact that the motion has received support from all sides of the House. It is heartening that so many Deputies have spoken positively in favour of a code of conduct. I listened with care to the speeches made last night and this evening. It is of the utmost importance that politics is restored to where it should be in the public mind. I listened with great interest to what Deputy Killeen had to say in quoting Aristotle. He was right to refer to the fundamental principle that politics is at the core of civil society. When politics is devalued, civil society is weakened. The code of practice for elected representatives sponsored by the Labour Party and supported by the Government through an amendment is but one part of the task that lies ahead in restoring politics to its proper place. For example, with the work having been done in regard to how representatives govern their behaviour in terms of their responsibilities, how it is to be placed in terms of the perception of politics in the wider world? Politics has been weakened by forces which we must also address. It may not be popular but it is necessary to say that what exists in the outside world is a comprehensive disinterest in ethics. In regard to, for <Col N="149" /> example, economic matters in the 1980s and 1990s Ireland went through a version of neo-liberal economics which proposed that many things both in the social and administrative realms were to be governed by market principles, whether it was broadcasting or social welfare or the distribution and delivery of services.</P>
      <P>There has been a collapse in language from political language generously conceived and philosophically built around the principle of social cohesion into a new neo-liberal guff that seriously marginalises that which is done for the public good. One does often hear words today such as &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;, &ldquo;social cohesion&rdquo;, &ldquo;redistribution&rdquo;, &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; and so forth except when people are forced to use them. I am under no illusion about the enormous task of recreating a social ethic built around the bonds of the larger society.</P>
      <P>Many of the institutional forces which describe politics, particularly in the media, hardly cover much of the work of politicians who have reformed the working of the Oireachtas through a committee system that is under funded, poorly staffed and hard working. One, therefore, regularly finds a corrosive diet of cynicism delivered, particularly to young people whom I had the honour to teach for more than 20 years, in which politics is continually devalued. It is important to recognise that the task of restoring the place of politics is not confined just to this one instrument and that it is a bigger task.</P>
      <P>Turning to the motion and that for which we have responsibility, it is best to speak bluntly and I am encouraged by Deputy Fleming and others to do so. It is my belief since I first stood for election more than 30 years ago that the vast majority of politicians entered out of a sense of public service. I recall often speaking to the late Noel Browne who would describe politics as the most important profession for which there is such little training. The most important training is in ethics. Most politicians have entered politics because of an impulse to give public service. Many people have left other occupations or businesses which were often more rewarding financially and otherwise to serve in public life.</P>
      <P>Those who are currently before the tribunals and, for example, have had allegations made against them to which they are replying have something in common. They are mostly people who had some connection with the grossly speculative activity, building land, in one form or another, a bloodsucker speculation that has made it impossible for people to put a roof over their heads. I emphasise out of a sense of fairness that these people from the shadows did not capture whole parties but sections of parties and it is a scandal that the public outrage is not directed at those who are responsible for that disgraceful intersection between politics and the worst elements of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians of all parties should not have to carry the burden of the behaviour of Mr. Haughey or Mr. Burke or all the others. It is in <Col N="150" /> the sense of building support for the motion that I need not complete the list. They have something in common and they are disproportionately from a certain version of the Fianna Fáil Party. There was something earthy about Deputy Killeen's reference to Aristotle. Perhaps the flavour of this debate is closer to Dylan Thomas who wrote in Under Milk Wood: &ldquo;O Lord we are not wholly good nor are we truly bad&rdquo;. That is the version politicians will recite.</P>
    <P>The value of the code is that it should be able to draw a distinction between something that happens in public life and mistakes. The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, last night stated there should be a mechanism for people to put a mistake right. As somebody who is a legislator and has been a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas, I say that would be a very valuable facility. There is a huge distinction between a mistake that can be corrected and a knowing act of corruption, which is very different.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Killeen that the sooner the House establishes autonomy in relation to its practices, funding and staffing separate from the Executive the better. We must also be clear that we are involved in a process which is necessary and of which, for example, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1996, which the Labour Party introduced in Government, and this motion tabled by the Labour Party are part. As the tribunals continue from time to time people put it around constituencies that the tribunals are costing a great deal and outline where all the money could be spent and so forth. I have heard tribunals bad mouthed again, unfortunately, by members of the Fianna Fáil Party who suggest that perhaps the money should be spent elsewhere.</P>

      <P>With regard to spending money in constituencies I have been contesting elections since 1969, mostly as a sole candidate, and have never spent more than £12,500. If Deputy Fleming wants to examine who is trying to buy votes, he should ask my constituency colleagues from his party about which one of them spent almost £50,000 on an election. He will get a very illuminating answer.</P>
      <P>It is good that there is such unanimity about the work before us. I also hope that those who cover this debate will embark on an agenda of discussing how they also might contribute to the appropriate regard and respect for politics and its profession, the importance of participation, and how dangerous and damaging to social cohesion it is if commentators suggest that, for example, younger people should be disinterested in politics or that there is something superior about being more interested in the economy than in the polity.</P>

      <Col N="151" /> We live one life and if it is to be lived morally it means putting politics at its centre, encouraging others to respect different opinions genuinely held and being able to encourage the most popular form of reflective moral discussion and the different content of politics as opposed to a pap corrosive cynicism that is borrowed from outside this country.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the cross-party support for the motion on a code of conduct, particularly the Government support, the bombast of Deputy Conor Lenihan's contribution contrasts with the telling comment made by his colleague, Deputy Roche, where he referred to the fact that not one of the young people who accompanied him in the House today was interested in politics. There is a great contrast between that and the attitude displayed by Deputy Lenihan in trivialising the issues covered by the motion. We would do well to listen to the points made by Deputy Roche regarding young people. If we cannot interest them in politics, there will be serious concerns about the future of democracy in Ireland. It will take a long time, unfortunately, to retrieve the reputation of politics after the damage that was done during the era referred to by Deputy Lenihan when George Colley and Charles Haughey vied for the leadership of Fianna Fáil. Huge damage has been done to the public perception of politics by the activities which are now coming to light at the tribunals. It will take the public a long time to get over the deeply held images of brown paper bags and of the most powerful person in the land being given wads of money in the way outlined in the tribunals.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to overcome that, however, and this code of conduct is part of a network of measures to do it. These measures have largely been introduced by the Labour Party and include the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Electoral Acts and other legislation. There is more legislation we wish to introduce, particularly legislation providing for the separation of business from politics. Such measures must be put in place if we are to reclaim politics after the damage that has been done, primarily by sectors of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Democracy is a hugely important instrument and our jobs in this House are important and powerful. The public knows that. They know we make decisions about basic things in their lives such as the education of their children, the health service and financial support when they are going through difficult times. They want to trust those decisions and be sure that Members represent them impartially and fairly. We are the people's intermediaries and representatives in the House so we owe it to them to ensure there is a restoration of confidence in the democratic process and in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put forward this code of conduct in that <Col N="152" /> context and I welcome the fact that it is supported by other parties. However, the other pieces of the jigsaw that are not yet in place are vital to restoring public confidence, particularly the separation of the funding of politics from big business and corporate bodies. People will still have questions if political parties continue to get large sums of money from representatives of business. They will have questions as to the outcome of the presentation of that money, whether it is to individual politicians or to political parties. We will not be able to clear that concern or those questions until the Labour Party legislation in that regard is enacted. Under that legislation, politicians will be unable to accept such contributions in order to fund politics. That measure and others, such as the whistleblowers legislation, have still to be agreed by the House.</P>
    <P>It is not until such time as these measures are implemented that people will turn back to politics and believe they can serve them in a transparent way. That is the essence of the public service which all Members of this House wish to represent. This code is an important part of what we are trying to achieve but we need to achieve the rest as well. We want Government support for the other measures.</P>
    <P>I am a relatively new Member of this House. We have a legacy from the past that we have great difficulty adjusting to and dealing with. Every day we meet people who have given up on politics as a way of providing for a just society and it is up to every Member to overcome that. We can do it but we must do so in a way that confronts these issues and brings us into an era in which people will know exactly how and why we operate and will be assured that we make decisions for the right reasons. While I welcome this code there are other measures, which are perhaps more important, that still must be agreed. I call on the Government parties to support the measures in this regard which the Labour Party has consistently put before the House.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support the motion, with some conditions which I will mention later. People who are guilty of manipulating the planning process for personal enrichment or of accepting bribes or who are influenced by gifts from big business, developers or speculators should have no place in an assembly that is supposed to represent the interests of the people. Unfortunately, the main establishment parties of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have, for decades, tolerated people who have been involved in the manipulation of the planning process and who have accepted gifts from speculators and developers. As a result, this type of corruption has found a manifestation in the membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Courtesy of those main establishment parties and what they have tolerated in their ranks over past decades, ordinary people would be forgiven for, and justified in, believing that Dáil Éireann provides a home for bribe takers, Ansbacher <Col N="153" /> men, tax amnesty clients, people who obstruct tribunals of investigation and even cattle rustlers. One might travel many a long day to find such a gallery of rogues in one institution.</P>
    <P>That is not to talk about the legal conflicts of interest that are tolerated in the Dáil. Sitting thickly on these benches are, for example, substantial landlords and wealthy publicans who are protected by legislation or lack of legislation, depending on which is better for their interests. Publicans are defended by legislation while landlords rack rent by virtue of an absence of legislation.</P>

      <P>The Government is happy to support this motion, subject to what is a useful amendment. We have had a valuable opportunity to discuss this important topic. The motion correctly refers to Article 15 of the Constitution which reserves to the Houses of the Oireachtas the making of rules in relation to the conduct of their business and membership. That important constitutional principle protects the vital independence of the Houses, a freedom at the heart of our democracy. The privilege of independence bestows the responsibility on all Members to properly order our affairs. It is important, therefore, that we produce an effective and well balanced code of conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide consensus in the House on the need for a code of conduct for Members and that the task should be bestowed on the Select Committee on Members' Interests. The drafting task itself is best left to the committee but it may be worthwhile to consider the type of code we, as Members, want for ourselves and future gener<Col N="155" /> ations. The code of conduct must be specific about the standards to be expected of Members in order to constitute a real source of guidance.</P>
    <P>I concur with comments made last night and earlier this evening to the effect that in an ideal world, we would all have a well developed personal sense of right and wrong. Most of us have exactly that. However, we live in a complex and challenging world and not every decision facing a Member of the Oireachtas is a black and white one. The code of conduct should help us, as Members of Parliament, to resolve those dilemmas. The code should also have regard to its overall context. The members of the Select Committee on Members' Interests are all experienced people who will be aware of the nature and breadth of the work of parliamentarians and their personal experience will be of considerable assistance to them.</P>
    <P>It is also important that committee members would have regard to the legislative context of their work. Considerable mention has been made during the debate of the various pieces of legislation affecting Oireachtas Members. A range of legislative initiatives is being progressed and the committee should bear these in mind when drafting the new code. In particular, the Standards in Public Office Bill sets out what the code's primary aspiration should be, namely the indication of standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the person to whom it relates in order that that person can be guided by the code and have regard to it in the performance of his or her duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards in public office legislation will confer additional legal status on the code of conduct. It will be admissible in court proceedings, the proceedings of the Select Committee on Members' Interests of the relevant House, a tribunal or the Standards in Public Office Commission. This should be borne in mind in the drafting stages. We must remember that the Standards in Public Office Commission will be established as a result of the standards in public office legislation. This House and its committee, rather than the new commission, will be the appropriate recipients of complaints about Oireachtas Members, other than office-holders, as is appropriate under the Constitution. However, the committee will be in a position to refer important issues to the commission for investigation if it so wishes. This will be an important additional facet of the committee's work as we are now conferring extra responsi<Col N="156" /> bilities on it. A code of conduct should underpin public confidence in the Houses' operations. It should, therefore, be capable of withstanding public scrutiny in regard to its content and the manner in which it will operate.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the provisions of the standards in public office legislation that the Government not only supports the introduction of a code for Oireachtas Members but has placed that within a legislative structure which will support and assist the Select Committee on Members' Interests in its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing five minutes of his time with me. I support the code of conduct proposed by the Labour Party but I believe the current cloud of suspicion which hangs over political and public affairs will only be dispelled through the introduction of a regime of true accountability and transparency. This will require a major programme of reform and the political will to carry out such a programme is less than evident from the contributions from the Government side.</P>
      <P>Codes of conduct alone, however welcome, will not resolve the problem. A clear and exemplary punishment must apply when accepted standards are contravened or disregarded. A new political environment must be created as we acknowledge that the trust upon which politics is founded has been shaken to the core by tribunal revelations over the past ten years. We, as politicians, must forge a new relationship with citizens and we must acknowledge that a golden circle of well-heeled business interests has exercised undue influence over a handful of senior politicians for years, thereby subverting constitutional democracy with little regard for its fundamental pillars.</P>
      <P>In order to restore the balance and attract public confidence, many areas of reform must be addressed. In short, we must amend the Electoral Act, 1997. We must publish a Bill which would place the role, functions, rights and responsibilities of political parties on a statutory footing. Registration of lobbyists' legislation is essential to address the twilight function of lobbyists within our political system. Such legislation would allow for full disclosure of lobbyists' activities, the development of a strict code of conduct for lobbyists and the banning of lobbyists from making political contributions to any individual candidate, politician or party. Each registered political party should be required by law to return a detailed annual financial statement clearly outlining all income and expenditure. Detailed particulars of all expenditure from State-funded leaders' accounts should be published on an annual basis. There must be a shift in the balance of political party funding from private donations from wealthy individuals and corporations to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing and expenditure of political parties strikes at the heart of democracy. If total <Col N="157" /> Exchequer funding is provided to political parties, no donations should be allowed. However, if some fund-raising is to remain, it must be tightly controlled and carefully measured. Donations must be clearly defined to include gifts and services as well as funding. It is not possible to distinguish between corporate and individual donations as it is common knowledge that many individual donations can be significantly higher than those from corporate entities and companies. Quite often, individual donations are effectively corporate donations paid through personal rather than business accounts. The reform of corporate and private funding for political parties must be based on the twin premises of equality and accountability. There are also consequences for smaller parties, independent and non-party candidates, some of whom have contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>In view of the imminent introduction of strict limits on donations to political parties, the issue of foreign donations must also be addressed. Gifts and bequests from international states and organisations should be banned. All candidates should be required to maintain a separate and distinct electoral bank account which would be available for inspection if, and when, required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Labour Party's proposed code of conduct which must be viewed as a component in an overall package which will assist the creation of a new political environment through the reform of crucial aspects of the manner in which we conduct our public affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the various Members who contributed to a very useful and important debate. A debate of this nature could be viewed as introverted in that we are examining our own affairs, conduct and standards. We would rather use this precious Private Members' Time to hold the Government to account and to debate its abysmal record on the health services, homelessness, housing, waste management or the myriad other pressing issues which demand our attention. However, due to circumstances of which we are all aware, we are again debating an issue which concerns the standards and behaviour of public representatives.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Labour Party position but there is a pattern in the way the Government and, in particular, the Taoiseach, respond to matters of this kind. It is quite clear that the strategy is, when it is put up to him, not to resist but to accept. As far as possible thereafter, however, bury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Government has not led on issues like this, tabling its own standards Bills rather than stopping progress on all the range of issues that colleagues of mine have listed, from whistleblowers to banning corporate donations, which has been the standard response to date. It is interesting that the Government has accepted the proposals we have put forward tonight. No doubt, in a week or in a month or two, they will be presented as Fianna Fáil pro<Col N="158" /> posals, just as the tribunals are now Fianna Fáil tribunals.

    <P>We make no excuse for tabling this motion. Let me set the record straight in relation to the Labour Party position on this so-called over-spend. In the five by-elections that have been fought on the basis of legislation that the Labour Party introduced in Government and that I had the <Col N="159" /> honour, as Minister for the Environment, of fighting through this House against the unremitting Opposition of Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the Progressive Democrats and which the current Attorney General announced as being unworkable and unconstitutional, we persisted and, after months of debate, got them enacted. We set the record.</P>
    <P>Labour spent £497 over the £17,000 limit in Dublin north and the Public Offices Commission concluded the over-spend was not knowingly incurred and that the amount was not material.</P>

      <P>In Dublin South Central the overspend was £257 over the £17,550 limit. Again, the Public Offices Commission concluded that the agent did not knowingly cause the over-spend and the amount over-spent was immaterial.</P>
      <P>Let me give one other valuable bit of information. The Labour Party was charged a rate of 21% VAT on its literature in those elections. We are now informed that that might have been a mistake and that we should have been charged VAT at a rate of 12.5%. We are most likely&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we fail to do this our pursuit of all other social objectives that we, individually and collectively as Deputies and parties, want will come to naught. It is a time for all in this House to address these matters and to end the whispering campaigns to which Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred that are going on around the House, such as &ldquo;they are all the same, they are all at it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are not all &ldquo;at it&rdquo;. The vast majority of every party in this House is not &ldquo;at it&rdquo;. It does no service to anyone or to the standards that we demand of everyone for this sleeveen whispering campaign of pulling everyone down to the lowest level. We will not have it and we need a collective will of the House to ensure it is faced down by us all.</P>
      <P>The simple truth is that a tiny handful of individuals have abused their positions in this House down the decades. They should be disowned by all and should not be stood by, not defended and not have their lies recycled on the national airwaves. That sort of approach will be the death knell of representative democracy.</P>
      <P>Why a code of conduct? Every profession now recognises the need for standards to be clearly laid down so that we have a yardstick by which our conduct can be judged and clear sanctions by which those who do not live up to those standards can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins is correct when he says we are not in the business of setting traps to trip ourselves. There will be misdemeanours, omissions and mistakes and we have to allow for those. The laws we have enacted try to do that to enable us to make corrections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are out to do is to deal with serious abuse. Article 15.10 of the Constitution allows us to do that. It sets parameters for us to regulate our affairs and up to this we have not used those <Col N="161" /> parameters, save to deal with disobedience of the Chair or disruptions in the House. It is time we used those sanctions.</P>
    <P>Let us understand those sanctions. I am a member of the Committee on Members' Interests and when we dealt with the complaint against Deputy Foley people did not understand the penalty, as we could only deal with the offence committed, not with the litany of other offences that were in the public domain. Let us understand and explain the standards and the penalties that we apply.</P>
    <P>Labour introduced the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, the Ethics in Public Offices Act and the Electoral Act, 1997. We are proud of our continued efforts in this regard. Tonight's proposals are but another step. They are a draft code and every Member must be part of the process of perfecting them.</P>
    <P>We can win back public confidence in politics and politicians but we must have that if our democratic institutions are to have any future. I hope the collective will of the House is a major step in that direction.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Compensation for Flood Damage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply to it.</P>
      <P>The reason for raising this matter is to appeal to the Minister to find a way in which a small group of small and part-time farmers in the Skeheenarinky-Burncourt area of south Tipperary can be compensated for significant loss they suffered as a result of flash flooding on 16 May. The loss incurred is small compared to the money available to the Exchequer. It is in the region of £60,000 and 25 small farmers are involved, which is an average of over £2,000 per farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 May 2000 extensive flooding occurred in the Burncourt-Skeheenarinky area of south Tipperary which resulted in extensive damage to property, agricultural land, roads and bridges. High rainfall intensity over a short duration resulted in a large surface run-off from the Galtee Mountains. This caused a number of landslides north of Burncourt and large quantities of tree stumps, trees, logs, stones and so on were washed down the mountainside. Damage costing some £.75 million was caused to local roads, bridges and so on. The resulting repairs were carried out by South Tipperary County Council. As a result of the flash flood, the River Tar burst its banks and the raging torrent washed away bags of fertiliser, swept away silage fields, ruined grass and deposited rocks and debris of all kinds in its <Col N="162" /> wake. It also swept away cattle and sheep. One elderly man in the area described the damage as the worst he had seen in his lifetime.</P>
    <P>The local Teagasc office assessed the damage caused to the 25 farmers involved. To give an indication of the loss sustained, in one case there was a loss of 25 ewes and 48 lambs; loss of cattle and 12 lambs; loss of a calf, silage and receding of silage and grassed areas. The number of people affected is very small. While the amount of money is small in national terms, it is significant for the farmers involved. The Red Cross is administering a scheme regarding flooding that occurred between 5 and 7 November. There was extensive flooding in the south Tipperary area on that occasion also. I appeal to the Minister to use that scheme or some other vehicle to give reasonable financial compensation to the farmers involved. It may not be possible for the Minister to respond positively tonight and, if that is the case, I ask him to consider the matter in the next few days and make some arrangement for the financial compensation of the individuals involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to reply to this issue. A number of matters were raised by the Deputy. I am much clearer now on the specifics of the issue and am certain it is an agricultural matter as distinct from one that should come into my area.</P>
      <P>The flood to which the Deputy refers occurred on 16 May 2000 in the Burncourt-Skeheenarinky area. In the immediate aftermath, the local authority prepared a report on the flood. The matter was raised in this House by way of parliamentary question and subsequently my officials visited the area in question. The rain storm that caused the flood was not widespread and was quite localised. The consequent flood event was, in the main, caused by logs and debris being washed into the stream, blocking bridges and reducing the flow capacity of the channel. It is fair to say that a most unusual combination of circumstances caused this damage. The local authority report mentioned damage to bridges and roads in the area. It did not, to my knowledge, mention significant or widespread damage to homes. That is also quite clear from what the Deputy said. He spoke of animals and crops. That is a separate issue and entirely a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of background, I should explain that the Government decision to put a humanitarian aid scheme in place followed geographically widespread and severe flooding in November 2000. This flood devastated many areas in the south, south-east and east. The Government decided to implement a humanitarian aid scheme to assist people who suffered severe hardship as a result of flooding around the country and requested the Irish Red Cross Society to administer the scheme. The operation of the scheme was similar to that for previous humanitarian schemes operated in 1995 and 1996. It should be emphasised that it <Col N="163" /> was humanitarian aid being provided to relieve hardship, not a scheme of compensation for losses, and that it applied solely to the flooding of 5 to 7 November 2000. The following were the steps involved in implementing the scheme. The Office of Public Works formally requested the Irish Red Cross Society to administer the scheme on behalf of the Government. The Irish Red Cross Society advertised in the national daily newspapers. Application forms issued to each applicant. All respondents were interviewed and assessed by the Red Cross, as was the case on previous occasions. The scheme was open to all who were affected by the flood of 5 to 7 November and was not confined to any geographical location or group.</P>
    <P>Applicants who were affected had to prove hardship under one of the following headings in order to qualify for aid: death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income or extreme hardship. The Red Cross Society requested that completed application forms be returned to it by mid-December in order to make the earliest possible determination of the extent of the hardship endured, that is, numbers and geographical spread of claimants and to establish the level of funding required to assist affected householders and others to get back on their feet.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the Red Cross has the required experience and expertise in dealing compassionately, impartially and effectively with the disbursement of such humanitarian assistance. Every effort is made to ensure that the various applicants' cases were assessed as speedily as possible and I am happy that the Irish Red Cross Society completed its assessment of applications received under this scheme and has submitted its report to me. I expect the Red Cross to be in a position to make the necessary payments in the next few days. The Irish Red Cross Society will prepare a report on its administration of the humanitarian aid scheme for Government in due course which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the breakdown of payments on a county by county basis. I am certain that the Deputy's county will be represented in that regard.</P>
    <P>From the information available to me I am satisfied that the flooding in Burncourt-Skeheenarinky could not be considered for the humanitarian aid package.</P>
    <P>The issues the Deputy raised are quite specific but it was somewhat related to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and I do not have any involvement in the loss of animals or crops as a result of flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I publicly inform the Minister of State that the owners of the Bon Secours Hospital, Tuam, County Galway have decided to close down the hospital from 6 April next. Unfortunately for the staff and the other workers, they <Col N="164" /> got their redundancy notices this morning and letters of closure for that date. This means that after a long period stretching back over decades, there will now not be a hospital in Tuam.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State knows, the Western Health Board had originally suggested an extension to Áras Mhuire, part of which would provide a more confined range of hospital facilities. At the best of times, this would not meet the requirements of the huge population around Tuam and its hinterland but when the news broke that the land needed for such an extension is not now available, this project is a non-runner.</P>
      <P>The case for a community type hospital for Tuam and its environs extending over a 15 mile radius from Tuam to north Galway and south Mayo is well documented. More than 30,000 people will be directly affected by this closure and, to put it bluntly, neither they nor I will stand for it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the University College Hospital Galway is literally packed to the doors. There has to be a place in the hospital system for the delivery of services in a community type hospital in a town that will grow from its present population of 6,000 to 7,000 to 15,000 within the next ten years.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter this evening because I want the Minister of State, on behalf of the senior Minister and the Government, and in conjunction with the Western Health Board, to declare his intentions in so far as this hospital is concerned. The present Bon Secours site is the proper place to locate the community type hospital facility. We now want a Government commitment that this facility will not alone be retained in Tuam but expanded. We do not want a situation to develop on the morning after 6 April, when the padlocks go on the gates for the last time. It would be much easier for the Western Health Board and the Minister's Department to engage in discussions.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the 30,000 people who want this hospital, who have attended public meetings and who have shown great anxiety, I want the Minister of State to give an undertaking this evening in regard to what his Department intends to do. The Minister and his senior Minister have met the local communities many times and the case is now well documented. What we did not know until today was the exact date the owners intended to close down the hospital. We now know that and we understand that it will now take serious negotiations, first of all on behalf of the Western Health Board, but at the end of the day this is about money. As far as we are concerned in that part of north Galway, health care for the future of our people is as important as the health care for people anywhere else. It is against that background and on their behalf that I ask the Minister what he intends to do about the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam.</P>

      <P>The Bon Secours <Col N="165" /> Hospital in Tuam is a private hospital and the question of its closure is a matter for the Bon Secours health system. I understand a press release was issued by the authorities of Bon Secours last Friday, 2 February, to the effect that the hospital would close in April of this year and that agreement on severance terms has been reached with staff representatives, as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The provision of health services in Tuam and throughout County Galway is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board. The board is expanding the range of services at University College Hospital Galway. A tender has been accepted for phase 2 of the development at UCHG and work commenced in June 2000. This phase will include an intensive care unit, including cardiac intensive care; a burns unit; a coronary care unit; additional operating theatres for cardiac surgery and orthopaedic surgery; orthopaedic beds for trauma; a cardiac surgery ward; an MRI unit; the upgrading of wards; a radiotherapy department; an administrative area; a medical records/admission department and a medical social work department.</P>
      <P>The provision of cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and MRI services will establish UCHG as a major centre of excellence in the provision of acute hospital care. It will mean that services that have traditionally been provided in Dublin will be available to the people of the west in their own region.</P>
      <P>A 30 bed rehabilitation unit for older people is being developed at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway for which a design team is currently being put in place. Under the national development plan, the board has plans to extend St. Francis Community Nursing Unit, Galway city and to construct new community nursing units in Ballinasloe and Loughrea.</P>

      <P>Earlier this month, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, met the Western Health Board and public representatives to discuss the situation and explore in a positive manner proposals for the future. The Western Health Board has informed the Minister that it has identified the need to provide a community hospital in Tuam and it has decided that a site within the existing Bon Secours Hospital complex or adjacent to it would be the most suitable location for such a facility. As a first step, the board wrote to the chief executive of the Bon Secours Health System on 25 January last expressing an interest in the possibility of purchasing the land or the site, plus the hospital building, when it became vacant. Following last Friday's announcement, I understand the board has written to the Bon Secours Health System with a view to commencing formal discussions on the possible sale of assets. The board has agreed to keep the Minister informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a minute of my time to Deputies Upton and McGennis, my colleagues in the constituency.</P>
      <P>The old Rowntree Mackintosh site on Inchicore Road, Kilmainham is directly opposite Kilmainham Gaol, which will be well known to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Ó Cuív, because their grandfather, Eamon de Valera, spent some time in that gaol at the time of the rising which gave rise to the foundation of this State. Inchicore and Kilmainham is a very historic area. W.T. Cosgrave was born in Kilmainham and was incarcerated within the vicinity of Inchicore. My own father is from Emmet Road, Inchicore and my mother is from Mount Brown, Kilmainham, both equidistant from this site and from Kilmainham Gaol. Both my parents could have literally thrown a stone into the gaol yard.</P>
      <P>In their memory, the memory of all the people from Inchicore and Kilmainham who consider that site to be precious, the memory of the Minister of State's own grandfather, the memory of W.T. Cosgrave and the memory of the people who gave their lives to found this State and who served in this State, I ask the Minister, who told us that Dúchas already has 700 sites and it does not need one more, to now take on this historic site, which dates back to a campsite for Brian Boru; there is evidence to show that is the case.</P>
      <P>What is proposed for this site is a commercial development which will be little more than a major office block with a few dressing up facilities attached. It will do terrible damage to the vicinity. It would bring an enormous amount of traffic and overlook houses in the vicinity. This site, which can be seen from the Phoenix Park and is adjacent to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, the only 16th century building in Dublin, if not in the country, still in use, is an important historic site. I plead with the Minister to enter into negotiations with Dublin Corporation to acquire this site and put it to use for cultural and heritage purposes, perhaps with the addition of a suitable hotel for tourists who are attracted into the area. I ask the Minister to make it a total of 701 sites and to meet a deputation of local people and Deputies to discuss this possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing his time with me. The proposed development of this historic site will add nothing to the area. Rather it will seriously damage the great historic and cultural value of the environment around Kilmainham. The application admits it has nothing to offer the local community. Many of the representations made refer to the great historic value of Kilmainham Gaol. This needs to be to the forefront in the consideration of any planning application. As it stands, the proposed development will totally dwarf the gaol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something like 200,000 visitors visit this historic area every year. Some parts of the site could <Col N="167" /> be used to develop and exploit the tourism potential of Kilmainham. The Kilmainham and Inchicore areas have great potential but in the past they have not been developed to the benefit of local people. I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the request of local people who, together with those who have an interest in local and national culture and history, are interested in the retention of the site for development as a cultural area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me an opportunity to make a plea not only on behalf of the residents of the area but on historic grounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say this is a matter for Dublin Corporation. However, even if it decides to refuse the application, which has been described by my constituency colleagues as an abomination, the local community and Dublin as a whole will have to fight a running battle in relation to this site which was once occupied by the old Rowntree factory and has been taken over by Nestlé. Due to its zoning and usage it is ripe for the wrong type of development. It appears from the soundings made to Dublin Corporation there is a strong possibility that if this application is refused a future application will proceed. We do not want to have to fight a running battle in relation to the future of the site.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, a response to the city council indicated that the Minister has sufficient sites in her ownership and she does not want to take on another one. If she does not take on this site this area will be destroyed. I plead with the Minister to look sympathetically at our request and to urgently meet a deputation to discuss the future of the site.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to put on the record the position in relation to Kilmainham Gaol.</P>
      <P>Kilmainham Gaol is one of the most important of the heritage sites managed by the Department. It was first opened in 1796 and served as a gaol until 1924. During its period of operation Kilmainham Gaol could be said to have functioned like a political seismograph, recording most of the significant tremors in the often turbulent relations between this country and our neighbours. With the exception of perhaps Daniel O'Connell and Michael Collins, it is possible to draw up a comprehensive list of nationalist leaders, including Éamon de Valera&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not list all the great people such as Robert Emmet, Ann Devlin and others who were incarcerated in the prison. The <Col N="168" /> 1916 leaders were also executed in the prison. It is possible to draw up a comprehensive list of nationalist leaders who were prisoners in Kilmainham during the years it operated as a gaol. The record will show that Éamon de Valera was the last prisoner to be released from Kilmainham Gaol. It can be said, therefore, that while the gaol may be empty of prisoners it is filled with history.</P>
      <P>Kilmainham Gaol is one of the most important of the heritage sites managed by the Department. By way of example, the number of visitors to the gaol in 2000 was in excess of 103,000. This does not take account of the some 17,000 who visited the site under the free educational visits scheme operated by the Department at heritage sites. Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the figures I have quoted are significant and reflect the status which the site enjoys not only among our population but also among overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>I have long recognised the important role the gaol has played both in terms of the heritage of Dublin and as an integral part of the city's tourism industry. It was for this reason the Minister, when making decisions on the allocation of funding available to the heritage area under the national development plan, approved substantial funding for three separate but equally important projects at the gaol &ndash; the re-roofing of the east wing, the relocation of the restaurant and the provision of much needed extra storage space. The exact sequence of these projects has yet to be determined but I am confident work on the site will commence during 2002.</P>

      <P>My Department has advised Dublin Corporation that the Rowntree-Mackintosh site is considered to have archaeological potential. As is normally the case in such instances, my Department has recommended to Dublin Corporation that if planning permission for the development is granted specific conditions relating to test excavations and archaeological monitoring should be attached. My officials have asked for these conditions to be attached specifically in the interest of protecting possible archaeological heritage which may be present on the site.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to make it clear, as she has done on a number of occasions when the matter was raised in the House by way of parliamentary question, that as the site is ear-marked for a major commercial development the question of its acquisition by the Department does not arise. I will convey the Deputy's request to the Minister who no doubt will be in contact with him directly in relation to the request for a meeting.</P>

      <P>This issue arose after Christmas when a number of farmers in County Kerry became concerned, as did the IFA, when cheques due under the ewe cull scheme had not been received as usual prior to Christmas. Dúchas advised these farmers on or about 11 January that the cheques were issued and were more than likely lost in the post and that the matter was being investigated. The farmers concerned were advised to write to Dúchas and apply for payment.</P>
      <P>Some days later a representative of the IFA discussed the matter on Radio Kerry. I am advised that on the same programme a Dúchas representative apologised for the fact that the cheques were not issued. It was stated by the official that a senior official in the Department was dealing specifically with the issue and that all outstanding cheques would be issued the next day. There was no reference to farmers having to apply for payment. No cheques had been received by 23 January. At that stage, one of the farmers concerned contacted Dúchas again and was advised most definitely that the cheques had been issued before Christmas, that what was stated on Radio Kerry was not correct, and that the situation was that anyone who had not received his cheque would be required to apply in writing. I have a copy of a letter sent to a farmer in question on that day which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further to our recent correspondence, I have rechecked the position with our accounts <Col N="170" /> branch and it does now appear that the cheque was never issued before Christmas. We apologise for this error. Please find enclosed your cheque for the ewe cull payment 2000.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would advise me why the cheques were not issued before Christmas as usual, and why these farmers were requested to apply in writing for these payments. The farmers in question were given the run-around by the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether all the farmers have now been paid. I also want clarification from the Minister of what happened. One of the most worrying aspects of this is that it appears that the Department was not in a position to identify who had been paid and who had not been paid. Otherwise farmers would not have been requested to write in and apply for the payment.</P>
    <P>I regret having to raise this matter in the House tonight, but the farmers concerned are entitled to know what happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this issue has been raised. I hope to be able to clarify it to the satisfaction of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The ewe compensation scheme arose from the 30% destocking which was undertaken at the end of 1998. This reduction in sheep numbers applied to the six western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim, Galway and Kerry, and was intended to address the serious ecological damage to our upland areas, much of which have been designated special areas of conservation (SACs). My Department therefore has the responsibility for paying compensation, which amounted to about £4.5 million in both 1999 and 2000, to the approximately 3,500 farmers involved. I am delighted the Deputy referred to payments being made &ldquo;as usual&rdquo;. As she is aware this is the second year of the scheme. I remember when people cast doubts on whether the payments would ever be made. However, we gave an undertaking and we will honour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First payments were made in December 1999, with the second round issued before Christmas 2000. Early in January 2001, it became clear that some of those who were due payment in the Kerry area had not received their cheques. Initially, it was thought that many of these cheques had been caught up in the Christmas post, but on checking with An Post this was found not to be the case. Instead, it was established that the problem was that a small number of cheques had not been issued. Immediate measures to remedy this situation were put in place and it was decided that where a farmer reported that he had not received a cheque, a new or replacement cheque would issue as a matter of urgency. Five telephone lines were available to receive reports of people not receiving cheques and people reporting this were asked to confirm it in writing. To date, my Department has received 86 written reports of missing cheques and has issued new or <Col N="171" /> replacement cheques to 81 of these people. The balance will issue during the coming week.</P>
    <P>While this is a small percentage of 3,500 farmers involved in the overall scheme, I fully appreciate that it has been a cause of anxiety and I very much regret any inconvenience caused. I am also aware that there was a great deal of confusion in the early stages with different reports in the media as to what was happening. I regret this, but the Deputy will agree that my Department moved swiftly and with sensitivity to ensure that all those affected received their entitlement as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> It is regrettable that this happened. A number of farmers approached me directly about this issue. I immediately contacted the Department, and every effort was made to deal as speedily as possible with this difficulty. This scheme has probably caused fewer problems than most agricultural schemes, and the response of the Department in terms of payment has been rapid. Most farmers would be willing to admit that in this case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 February 2001.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report from the judicial committee was published on 25 January last and I understand it was circulated to all interested parties including members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations contained in the recent report from the judicial committee established by the Chief Justice, following on the recommendations of the sixth report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission, is the establishment on a statutory basis of a Judicial Council which would, <i>inter alia</i>, deal with matters relating to judicial conduct and ethics while preserving the principle of judicial independence as set out in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judicial committee has concluded, in much the same way as the 1999 Report on the Courts and the Judiciary from the All-Party Oireachtas <Col N="174" /> Committee on the Constitution, that the existing structures for dealing with concerns as to judicial misconduct are inadequate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I intend, following careful consideration of its recommendations and the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, to develop proposals for consideration by Government in the areas of constitutional change and legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the licensing laws were the subject of considerable review by the Oireachtas Committee which reported in June 1998. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated, took into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee as well as submissions I received from groups and members of the public. During the passage of that legislation, I also took account of the views of Members of the House. The review of our intoxicating liquor laws has not ended with this legislation and the House will be aware that on 1 November 2000, I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws, including an examination of systems in other countries.</P>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of persons who drink exercise a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption, and it would not be appropriate that measures taken to help curb drink abuse would have the effect of penalising those who behave responsibly. The new trading hours, introduced by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, reflect the changed pattern in drinking habits and are designed to facilitate the person who drinks responsibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are negative consequences that result from the abuse of alcohol. We are all too well aware of the contributing role which excessive alcohol consumption plays in fuelling criminal and anti-social behaviour. Many of the attacks and assaults that happen on our streets, particularly late at night, and sadly even among people of a young age, have their origin in excessive alcohol consumption. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, strengthened the law against underage drinking and provided that, where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an underage person is <Col N="175" /> upheld, the licensed premises can be closed for a specified period.</P>
    <P>While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of underage drinking, it cannot be viewed as the total solution. Dealing with the underage drinking problem should not be seen as the province of State agencies alone &ndash; parents, the drinks industry and the media too must also play their part in helping to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner, as well as formulating specific operational policing responses to the issue of violence on our streets, has brought together people to provide expert advice on the particular factors which appear to be at work in the manifest tendency towards serious violence in certain instances among young people. Expert advice of this kind &ndash; from psychologists, sociologists, etc. &ndash; must inform the type of police response required.</P>
    <P>As to the immediate policing response, the Garda Commissioner has indicated on a number of occasions that special emphasis is being placed by the Garda on the enforcement of the law in relation to street crimes. A national public order initiative known as Operation Oíche has been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. This project essentially involves the strategic use of extra gardaí to tackle the problem of violence among young people at or in the vicinity of certain discos and places where youngsters gather at night. The operation focuses on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, underage drinking, illicit drugs use and underage alcohol sales. Operation Oíche began as a pilot scheme in Dublin and was extended to large towns and cities which, in the Garda view, require a similar targeted response. Particular operations such as those I have mentioned require resources. I am glad to say that, as Minister, I have been able to secure a significant and sustained increase in the resources allocated to the law and order system generally. This increase in resources has occurred across the entire criminal justice system, not only in relation to the Garda Síochána but in other areas such as the prisons and the courts. Garda CCTV systems already in place have had a beneficial effect in addressing a variety of public order offences. Apart from providing greatly increased resources I have also been reforming the criminal law in very significant ways. An important function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to take a proactive approach to law reform to ensure that the criminal justice system is equipped to respond effectively to the investigation and prosecution of the modern day manifestations of crime. Since coming into office, I have already piloted a considerable number of Bills through the Oireachtas. As well as the several Bills presently before the Oireachtas, my officials are currently working on the Criminal <Col N="176" /> Justice (Garda Powers) Bill which I aim to introduce this year.</P>
    <P>The question of research into the negative aspects of alcohol consumption and the measures that need to be undertaken to limit those effects can also be addressed outside the context of the licensing laws. They are, in effect, matters that fall to be addressed in the context of health promotion generally. In this context, the national alcohol policy is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems. Given the number of initiatives already under way, I have no proposals to initiate a referral of the subject matter of the Deputy's question to the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>There are 118 offenders currently in custody serving life sentences. Within this group of offenders, sentences served range from two days, in the case of a person convicted on Monday of this week, to over 36 years, in the case of a person convicted in 1964. A mathematical average of the duration of sentences served by this group would not, therefore, give an accurate reflection of an average life sentence.</P>
      <P>In the period from January 1995 to December 2000, 41 persons serving life sentences were released. The average number of years served in prison by the prisoners released in this group was 14.</P>
      <P>Upon release from prison, life sentence offenders are subject to various conditions which may include supervision for the rest of their lives by the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 60, 167, 168 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>As I have previously informed the House, Operation Oíche has been in operation in cities and large towns since October 2000. I understand from the Garda authorities that, as part of this operation, each divisional officer compiled an operational plan which incorporated all initiatives and operations to combat public order problems and illicit drug use. I am informed that additional plans to focus on public intoxication and underage drinking were also developed.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider the operation to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night-clubs, and the gardaí continue to visit licensed premises to impress an even greater awareness on the licensees of their responsibilities. I am further informed that in Dublin, the new corporation bye-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor on public streets have proven very effective. I also understand that Operation Oíche has received favourable comments from both the general public and the business community.</P>
      <P>In relation to Limerick, other initiatives have also been taken by local Garda management. For example, one of these has concentrated on known criminals in Limerick city, has been in operation since February 2000 and numerous arrests have been made. Another was put into operation at the commencement of January 2001 as a result of a number of shootings and other incidents that had occurred in the Southill area. Again, I am informed that this operation has been successful with a number of unlawfully held firearms discovered and persons arrested for various offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more recent initiative deals with the issues of crime prevention and the monitoring of crimi<Col N="178" /> nals in the area. As well as these initiatives, Operation Oíche is also in operation in Limerick and has been very successful to date, with the number of public order incidents having been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a CCTV system for Limerick city is scheduled for later this year. Twenty-three cameras are proposed for the city centre area and work has begun to upgrade the facilities at Henry Street Garda station before the system goes live. Gardaí are also consulting with the local authority with regard to regulating the opening hours of fast food premises in an attempt to assist in reducing the large number of people who congregate around these premises late at night.</P>
    <P>The main legislative provisions relevant to street violence are contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990. These provisions are kept under review and any proposals I might have for changes would be announced in the usual way.</P>
    <P>In relation to offences committed by juveniles, I am confident that the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Oireachtas, will have a significant effect on public order offences caused by young people. In particular, the Bill contains specific proposals on the responsibilities of parents. One of these orders, for example, may oblige parents to take measures to remedy whatever it is that caused them to lose control over their children. The Bill also gives the courts power to impose a curfew on persons under 18 years of age. As the House may be aware, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, significantly strengthened the provisions against the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor to underage persons. In addition, I understand that all members of the Garda Síochána have been instructed to utilise their powers under public order legislation to full effect when dealing with such incidents.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Food Safety Promotion Board is carrying out research to ascertain whether there are adverse physiological effects and behavioural changes associated with the consumption of stimulant drinks. The House will also be aware that the Garda Commissioner has convened an advisory group to examine the issue of street violence. In addition, I can tell the House that the National Crime Council is undertaking a major research project in relation to public order offences which should significantly enhance the information available to us about the scope and nature of this problem.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;street violence&rdquo; does not readily correspond to any particular category of crime as reported in the Annual Report of An Garda Síochána. I should point out also that statistics for the year 2000 are still being compiled and have not yet been made available to my Department.</P>

      <P>The prisoner referred to is serving a sentence in Castlerea Prison since 16 February 1999 and is due for release on 14 February 2002. He was originally sentenced to five years' imprisonment but this was reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal to a sentence of four years' imprisonment.</P>

Without going into details, I can inform the Deputy that, in common with other offenders committed for the same offence, a sentence management programme was approved for this offender in August last year. This includes short periods of temporary release which are subject to strict conditions, particularly a prohibition on returning to his home area. This condition is imposed expressly in view of the distress that encountering him would cause the victim's family. In addition, his case in subject to regular review and his progress is constantly monitored. I should point out that all offenders are subject to conditions while on temporary release. If any of these conditions are breached the gardaí can immediately return the offender to prison and the temporary release programme is automatically terminated. To date, the prison authorities have received no complaints in relation to the offender's behaviour while on temporary release. Furthermore, the Director General of the Prisons Service has had inquiries made in recent days with the gardaí who have confirmed that he has not come to their attention while on temporary release. All his periods of temporary release were to a location over 20 miles from the residence of the victim's family. No charges are pending in relation to this prisoner according to the information available to the prison authorities who have checked into this with local gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sensitivities and concerns of victims of crime are carefully considered during the sentence management process. Sometimes conflicting factors such as the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community must also be considered and a balance struck. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be greater, in certain cases, if <Col N="180" /> attempts at planned reintegration of offenders were not made. Where appropriate, structured temporary release programmes for re-socialisation purposes and to allow the reintegration of offenders into the community are put in place.</P>
    <P>In any individual case where a victim's family makes known their views these are always taken into account. In this case the victim's family made known their concerns to the prison authorities at an early stage and this was taken into account in managing the sentence. While the victim's family were not informed in advance of temporary releases up to now, I can inform the House that procedures are being put in place whereby, if they so wish, they will be informed prior to any future period of temporary release for this offender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that on 19 January, 2001 there were 4,332 cases awaiting forensic examination in the Forensic Science Laboratory. The number of cases received in the laboratory during the year 2000 was 11,326.</P>
      <P>The total number of cases awaiting examination were as follows: three &ndash; six months, 1,200; six-12 months, 1,106; in excess of 12 months, 1,294 and in excess of two years, 732. These figures would include a total of 439 cases where an examination had commenced but had not yet been completed. In addition the Deputy should be aware that cases awaiting examination in excess of two years would mainly be drugs cases where no suspect has been identified but where the material found has been submitted by the Garda for examination in any event. These are, naturally, afforded a lower priority than cases where a suspect has been identified.</P>
      <P>The examinations fall into three distinct categories &ndash; biology, including DNA testing, chemistry and drugs. In the case of biology/DNA testing the examinations involve the examination and analysis of clothing, intimate swabs and other material, etc. in cases involving murder, rape and other serious types of assaults. In the case of chemistry examination, the examinations involve detection, comparison and analysis of paint, glass particles, clothing fibres, hydrocarbon fire accellerants, shoe prints and shotgun residue etc. in cases involving serious assaults, burglary, criminal damage, arson, explosions, road accidents, robbery, unlawful taking of vehicles and cases involving possession of firearms.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the cases awaiting forensic examination are drug analysis examinations. This situation has arisen as a result of the recent success of the Garda Síochána in drug seizures. In 1998 and 1999, for example, illicit drugs with an estimated street value of £120 million were seized. In order to improve the situation my Department has recently sanctioned the purchase of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer to speed up the analysis of powder drugs such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines. The management of the laboratory also operate a system of case prioritisation to ensure that all urgent cases are dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that priority is afforded by the Forensic Science Laboratory to cases where prosecutions are pending and, in particular, to such cases as suspected child abuse, where an oral report on test findings is provided as soon as possible, usually within a couple of days. I am advised that no prosecutions have been lost as a result of delays in testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> I should also mention that my Department has commissioned an independent review of the administrative, management and organisation requirements of the Forensic Science Laboratory by a firm of management consultants. The consultants are expected to finalise their report shortly.</P>

      <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, agreement was reached in March 1994, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the Force who retired after 1 January 1993. The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &ndash; Clause 3 &ndash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The agreement does not allow for retrospection. There are 1,050 gardaí affected by this agreement.</P>

      <P>As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, I recently announced the allocation of a total of £12 million towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001.</P>
      <P>As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-02.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that tenders will soon issue for the provision of town centre CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The planning, including the consultation process, for the location and operation of Garda CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford will commence later this year with the objective of having the systems installed and operational in 2002.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that a local town centre CCTV implementation committee will be established by the local chief superintendent in each area where a Garda CCTV system is to be installed. The local chief superintendent will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the CCTV system in his-her particular area. The composition of this committee will include representatives of the following: Garda telecommunications section who will project manage the technical aspects of the system, local crime prevention officers, ESB, local authority, Office of Public Works and local business interests. While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature of them and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a <Col N="184" /> national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme this year to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that recently there have been a number of developments in relation to the relocation of the head office of the Legal Aid Board to Caherciveen. I understand that the contract for the <Col N="187" /> design and construction of the new headquarters premises has recently been awarded and that the planning permission process is already under way. Both staff and their representative unions are being kept fully informed of all developments in relation to the proposed move to Caherciveen. I understand that management have also advised the unions that any request from them for discussion on matters arising from the transfer will be promptly facilitated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may already be aware the proposed number of staff to be located in Caherciveen is 39 but when account is taken of the staff at dual locations, the total number of staff working from the Caherciveen base will be 42. Once again I must state that I am not prepared to depart from the normal practice of not disclosing the precise numbers and grades of those who do not have an interest in transferring to Caherciveen, lest those who have expressed such a wish be identified. However, I can inform the Deputy that a small number of staff serving in the Legal Aid Board have expressed an interest in transferring to Caherciveen and others have indicated an interest in moving in the event of promotional opportunities becoming available. Staff of the board who do not wish to move to Caherciveen will, of course, be redeployed throughout the Civil Service to take the places of those civil servants who successfully applied for decentralised positions in Caherciveen.</P>
      <P>As regards recruitment the Deputy may already be aware that the Legal Aid Board, in accordance with normal decentralisation procedures, requested the Department of Finance to issue an interdepartmental circular seeking applications from persons throughout the Civil Service who would be willing to transfer to the Legal Aid Board for permanent transfer to Caherciveen. Following prior consultation with the relevant staff unions that circular issued in June 2000. The board received a satisfactory response and are currently in the process of recruiting staff who have applied to transfer to Caherciveen. I am informed that transfers to the board have already commenced. In understand that to date four higher executive officers have transferred to the board with a view to moving to Caherciveen. Arrangements have been made for one principal officer, one assistant principal, one further higher executive officer and one executive officer to transfer to the board in the next few weeks. Further transfers will take place over the coming months at all levels. At this early stage in the proceedings it is not possible to give any indication of whether it will be necessary to recruit new staff. I expect that this information will become apparent towards the latter part of the current recruitment process.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to provide details of the total cost of the move to Caherciveen since the acquisition of land and the design and construction contracts in relation to the new premises is being managed by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>As announced by the Chief Whip on 25 January, 2001, the Government Legislation Programme indicates that the Courts and Court Officers Bill will be published in this session. The scope of the Bill is wide-ranging and it is the nature of such Bills that they tend to increase in scope and size during the course of being drafted. That has been the experience with this Bill also. However, I can assure the Deputies that the Bill is now very close to being finalised for publication. </P>

      <P>The decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases in question, Heaney and McGuinness <i>v</i>. Ireland and Quinn <i>v</i>. Ireland, deal with the position of section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 in the particular circumstances where the law in relation to the use of inculpatory statements was unclear. This was prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of National Irish Bank of 21 January, 1999, which clarified the law generally in this area.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has initiated a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts. A committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Hederman has been established for that purpose and is to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with recommendations for reform of the law in this area. It is expected that the committee will present its report to me in the near future. I am sure that these judgments of the Court of Human Rights will be taken into account by the committee in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 March, 2000 the Government agreed with my recommendations for a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, to be called the Reception and Integration Agency. It will replace the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and incorporate the Refugee Agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the new agency will operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the Reception and Integration Agency follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on the Integration of Refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The Reception and Integration Agency will be the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment will facilitate a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. The agency will have responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government in 1999.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government to put the Reception and Integration Agency on a statutory basis as soon as other legislative priorities permit. As the Government has not yet had the opportunity to consider any such proposals, any definitive comment by me at this stage in relation to delegation of authority or budgetary control would be inappropriate. However, I can say that in line with the Government's Strategic Management Initiative and the approach adopted in relation to other agencies in the Justice area, my intention is that the Reception and Integration Agency will have operational independence in its day to day activities, have its own board and its own budget.  </P>

      <P>The Report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland (the Patten Report) recommended that, in order to broaden the pool of applicants for senior posts in the Northern Ireland police, senior officers in other UK police and in the Garda Síochána should be invited to apply for positions. This was with a view to doubling the proportion of Catholics in posts of superintendent and above.</P>
      <P>The Police Authority for Northern Ireland has sought applicants from the Garda Síochána for a post of Assistant Chief Constable in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988 (as amended) prescribe the criteria for recruitment of trainees and, following the requisite period of training, the appointment of members to the Garda Síochána. In this regard, it is open to any member of another police force to apply to join the Garda Síochána provided they have the necessary qualifications in terms of education, age etc. Of particular interest to persons normally resident outside the State, it should be noted that, unlike a number of other police forces in Europe, there is no citizenship requirement for entry to the Garda Síochána, i.e. the regulations do not require that an applicant for the Garda Síochána must be an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the recommendation in the Patten report arose in the context of the particular requirements which arise in relation to policing in Northern Ireland. While there are no plans at present to advertise senior positions in the Garda Síochána among other police forces, I can assure the Deputy that the separate recommendation in the Patten Report relating to exchanges between the Garda Síochána and the new Police Service in the North has been fully accepted by the Government and is being actively pursued.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): On 11 May 1999 during an operation at night in the Clare/Galway region, the Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport. The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations &ndash; including that &ldquo;the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by GASU pilots.&rdquo;  This recommendation was accepted and acted upon.</P>
    <P>The training and allocation of pilots is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Defence and the Air Corps. Nevertheless, I obviously have a keen interest in this matter in the context of GASU operations. In this regard, officials from my Department and the Garda authorities &ndash; in conjunction with officials from the Department of Defence and the Air Corps &ndash; have been actively pursuing the issues raised in the report.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 88 of 15 November, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, as an exceptional measure, agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who had been in this country for more than 12 months, who were still awaiting a final determination of their application for refugee status and who had been compliant with their obligations as asylum seekers should be given the right to seek work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July, <Col N="194" /> 1999, as soon as they crossed the 12 months threshold.</P>
    <P>In December 1999, the Government decided to remove the requirement that an employer must obtain a work permit before employing asylum seekers covered by the 26 July, 1999 Government decision.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter confirming entitlement to work for presentation to potential employers and my Department arranged accordingly. To date, over 2,600 such letters have issued.</P>
    <P>As I previously informed the House, it is not proposed to allow asylum applicants who are not covered by the aforementioned July decision to take up paid work pending a final decision being made on their applications.</P>

    <P>Although comprehensive statistics for the year 2000 are not yet available in published form, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of incidents of car theft reported in the Dublin metropolitan region in the first ten months of 2000 shows a reduction of 9% compared to the same period in 1999.</P>
    <P>So-called joyriding is a complex problem which can only be tackled meaningfully and to lasting effect through a multifaceted and multi-agency response involving both the community and relevant statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of the criminal justice system, the Garda Síochána are operating special foot and mobile patrols targeting specific areas in response to identified local requirements. All vehicles, the subject of unauthorised takings, are technically examined when recovered and known offenders are targeted for these offences. Each division also has a traffic unit which, outside of peak traffic hours, targets incidents of joyriding and the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts. I understand that special plain clothes patrols, which concentrate on identifying cars that could be seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, are showing some success. The Garda Air Support Unit has also been particularly effective in this area. In 1999, the unit assisted in the recovery of 62 stolen vehicles and the arrest of 226 persons.</P>
    <P>Persons serving sentences for persistent offences are not granted temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Garda Síochána and local auth<Col N="198" /> orities are working together in relation to estate management and are actively reducing the opportunities for joyriding. For example, physical changes, such as barriers and speed ramps, are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by young persons engaged in these activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Initially I would like to reiterate to the House my revulsion at the callous killing of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe. I fully understand it is very difficult for his family and friends to come to terms with such a loss and can appreciate they and many other members of the public are opposed to the idea that the prisoners convicted in relation to his death are benefiting from what may be perceived in some quarters as concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform it is my responsibility to consider all applications for temporary release while trying to strike a balance between the need for persons sentenced by the courts to serve their debt to society and the need to be as understanding and <Col N="199" /> humane as possible in relation to the granting of such temporary releases.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I can confirm that I approved short periods of temporary release to four of the prisoners involved. Each period of release, which consisted of three overnights in each case, were granted for valid compassionate reasons. One of the prisoners referred to received a period of temporary release in September 2000. Two of the prisoners were granted compassionate temporary release in October of last year with one of these prisoners receiving an additional period of temporary release last month. A fourth prisoner received temporary release in December 2000 and the other prisoner convicted in relation to this crime has received no temporary release to date.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that each application for temporary release was considered in accordance with the normal criteria that apply in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 149 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The questions refer to the comments made by the Supreme Court in the recent case The People (DPP)&ndash;v&ndash;Finn. In that case the Supreme Court commented on a practice whereby, in imposing <Col N="200" /> sentence, a court also provides for a review of the sentence, i.e. it sets a date in the future when the sentence will be reviewed by that court. The Supreme Court said that sentences in this form are undesirable and the practice of imposing them should be discontinued. I should explain that while the comments were made &ldquo;obiter&rdquo; they can, however, be expected to have a strongly persuasive effect, particularly as the Supreme Court in making the comments stated that it was satisfied that it would be desirable in the public interest that such guidance should be available to trial judges.</P>
    <P>Other comments made by the Supreme Court in the case fall to be considered by the Executive. The court suggested a number of reasons for the growth of this practice including the need created by the &ldquo;revolving door syndrome&rdquo; to ensure that prisoners actually served their sentences and the absence of any significant legislative initiative on the topic. The Supreme Court went on to say that it is extremely desirable that remission and sentence review should be placed on a clear and transparent basis but that it is ultimately a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether to retain the present system, put it on a clearer and more transparent basis, devolve it to a parole board or confer it on the courts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the views of the Supreme Court in this matter. I have devoted a great deal of my energy since becoming Minister to dealing with the problems identified by the Supreme Court as facilitating the growth of the practice of imposing reviewable sentences. As a result of this Government' s unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure&ndash;1,207 prison places were provided by the end of last year&ndash;the revolving door syndrome is now, thankfully, a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I have already announced my intention to proceed with the establishment of a parole board on an administrative basis pending the enactment of legislation to create a statutory parole board. I had planned to provide for the statutory parole board as part of the Prisons Bill which is being prepared in my Department. As I indicated today in response to Question No. 33 from Deputy Deasy, I am reflecting on whether to separate out the provisions dealing with the parole board from the rest of the Prisons Bill, principally to allow the non-statutory parole board to gain experience before putting it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the House to another important legislative initiative which I am proposing. I expect shortly to ask Government to approve the publication of a Criminal Justice (Temporary Release) Bill, 2001. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, so as to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power. I am satisfied that this Bill, together with the establishment of the parole board, will provide the clear and transparent basis which the Supreme Court has said is desirable, as <Col N="201" /> well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent Scottish case concerning the issue of confiscation orders following conviction under the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995. Since the Deputy tabled his question, I understand that the decision of the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal in this case has been reversed on appeal.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau's powers to freeze and confiscate criminal assets here arises under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. This Act provides for the civil forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. It is the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which contains provisions whereby the Court is empowered, following conviction, to make orders for the confiscation of assets which it assesses to be the proceeds of offences. The operation of the legislation is kept under review and if changes are considered necessary these will be brought forward and considered by the Government in the usual way.</P>

      <P>Guidelines in the form of a Government decision taken in March 1993 were issued to all Departments.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis.</P>
      <P>The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice.</P>
      <P>These guidelines were extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature etc.</P>

      <Col N="202" /> Each Minister is responsible for implementation of the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision in March 1993, my Department undertook to monitor the position on a quarterly basis with a view to enhancing gender balance. Quarterly returns are submitted by each Department showing the gender composition of the State boards under that Department's aegis.</P>
    <P>The figures for membership of State boards on 30 September 2000, show that 29% of the total serving membership were women and 71% were men. In the case of ministerial appointments 34% were women and 66% were men. Women comprised 18% of chairs of boards.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, already provides that the court may order a person convicted of an offence to pay compensation in respect of any personal injury or loss resulting from the offence to any person who has suffered such injury or loss. Section 6 sets out the conditions under which such an order may be made, and the factors to be taken into account by the court in deciding on the amount of the compensation order. I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that I am providing in section 13 of the Children Bill, 1999, that where a court finds a child guilty of an offence, the court will be able to order the parent or guardian of the child to pay compensation. The Bill will provide that a court will be able to make such an order only where it is satisfied that the wilful failure of the parent or guardian to take care of or to control the child contributed to the criminal behaviour. In the light of these provisions, I have no plans for further legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> I confirm, as indicated in the Government legislation programme as announced by the Chief Whip on 25 January 2001, that the heads of a Bill to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, are in course of being developed in my Department. It is the policy of this Government that the new law addressing the dealings between non-nationals and the State should reflect contemporary values and realities, and be applied fairly, justly and humanely. It will provide a solid legislative framework setting out core values and principles within which fair and sensible immigration policies to meet the changing needs of Irish society will be developed and implemented. It will deal with, for example, pre-entry procedures, entry conditions and procedures and residence requirements. The legislation will, in effect, represent the first ever fundamental review of the State's principal legislative measure in the immigration area and will take into account best international practice in the area including developments at the EU level.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation is a key element of this Government's legislative programme and of its overall strategy in the area of immigration and asylum. The development of this legislation is a complex and difficult matter. In further development of my proposals for the legislation I propose to engage in a wide consultation process with relevant interests.</P>
    <P>The Immigration and Residence Bill forms part of a wide programme of reform of our immigration and asylum laws and their enforcement. My Department is, in addition, preparing for early publication the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Bill. It will tackle the problem of improperly documented non-nationals arriving in the State by requiring carriers to ensure that passengers presented by them for entry into the State have a current valid passport or other acceptable form of national identity document and, where necessary, a current valid visa.</P>
    <P>The measures I have mentioned will add considerably to the code of law that now exists by way of the Immigration Act, 1999, which amended the Refugee Act, 1996, to make that Act workable. Apart from the commencement orders themselves, seven sets of Statutory Instruments were made by me to give detailed effect to the Refugee Act as amended. The Act is now fully operational, and the offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and an independent appeals body, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, have been created following on my initiatives in that legislation. The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, is also part of the code of law that I have initiated as Minister. It criminalises the cruel trade of trafficking in human beings. In addition, it provides for a statute-based scheme of judicial review for asylum and immigration cases.</P>
    <P>These primary pieces of legislation have been the subject of extensive and protracted debate in this House and the Seanad as well as in other public fora including, in the case of the Illegal <Col N="204" /> Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, an examination by the Supreme Court of the constitutionality of certain of its provisions. It is my intention to progress all new measures, including the Immigration and Residence Bill, as quickly as possible consistent with the need for proper consultation and examination of the complex technical and legal issues.</P>

      <P>Article 34.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law shall be administered in public.</P>
      <P>The law recognises the special circumstances surrounding criminal proceedings in the case of certain types of offences and has created statutory exceptions to the administration of justice in public in accordance with the above constitutional provision. In the case of sexual offences, the main relevant statutory provisions are as follows.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as substituted by section 11 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, in the case of a rape offence, and section 2 of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995, in the case of an offence under the 1908 Punishment of Incest Act, provide for the exclusion from the court of all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press and other persons at the discretion of the judge or the court. The provisions also provide that, in the proceedings concerned, the verdict and the sentence, (if any) shall be announced in public. In the case of an application to introduce evidence or cross-examine a complainant in a sexual assault offence case about his or her previous sexual history, all persons are excluded from the court except officers of the court and persons concerned in the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended by section 17 of the 1990 Act, prohibits the publication of matters likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in sexual assault offence cases, though it gives the court discretion to waive the anonymity requirement in certain circumstances. Section 8 of the 1981 Act, as amended by section 14 of the 1990 Act, prohibits the publication of matters <Col N="205" /> likely to lead members of the public to identify the accused charged with a rape offence unless and until convicted, subject again to the courts discretion to waive or maintain anonymity in certain circumstances. There are anonymity provisions in the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act both in relation to persons charged with an offence under the 1908 Act and in relation to persons in relation to whom such an offence is alleged to have been committed.</P>
    <P>The questions of public access and anonymity in sexual offence trials were addressed in the Discussion Paper on the Law on Sexual Offences which I published in 1998. The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, at present before this House, is the first piece of legislation arising from an analysis of the views received on the Paper. When that legislation has been enacted, the views received on the other issues addressed in the Paper will be analysed and, if the need for further legislation is identified, I will request the Cabinet to approve the preparation of such legislation.</P>

      <P>Serious consideration is always given to the sensitivities and concerns of the victims of crime in all areas of the treatment of offenders. The possible effect of the release of the perpetrator of a serious crime on his or her victim is an extremely important consideration in sentence management.</P>
      <P>In certain cases where an early release might pose potential difficulties for a victim's family, such as, for example, where a serious offender is likely to come into contact with his/her victim's family in the community, special measures to prevent this are taken by the prison authorities such as making it a condition of the offender's temporary release not to reside in or go near a particular area. In all instances, the offenders' cases are carefully managed and are kept under continuous scrutiny and review in my Department in consultation with the local prison authorities and, where appropriate, the Garda.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is the practice with offenders who are nearing the completion of their sentences for violent crimes, in particular those with a sexual element, for the local prison authorities to inform the Garda of their imminent release. The Garda inform the victims and/or the families, where they believe this is necessary. Also, where victims of crime make contact with my Department and express a wish to be informed in the event of such a release, every effort is made to contact them in the time leading up to the release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department, in line with the <Col N="206" /> Victims Charter, frequently meet the families of victims to listen to and to record their views. This is a positive development and one that I would like to see continuing in the context of the overall question of sentence administration and management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern that has been expressed by commentators over many years about deficiencies in the health care service available to prisoners. One of the worst aspects of prisoner health care which I inherited on taking office was vast overcrowding in unsanitary conditions throughout our prisons. I have acted decisively to address this issue creating over 1,200 new prison spaces.</P>
      <P>As a general principle, I hold that prisoners' health care arrangements should fully match public health care provision in the general community. In November 1999, I established a group to review the structure and organisation of prisons health care services. The terms of reference of this group are to consider and make recommendations regarding the structure and organisation of primary medical and nursing services within the prison environment in light of the development of health care services generally and the needs of the prison population, to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramification of possible new mental health legislation, to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly, to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system, to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations and to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review body is under the chairmanship of Mr. John Olden, a member of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody, and former Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta. The membership of the review group consists of representatives of: Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Department of Health and Children; Department of Finance; Director of Prison Medical Services; a senior prison governor; a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners; a nominee of the Royal College of Psychiatry; a nominee of An Bord Altranais; A nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society; a nomi<Col N="207" /> nee of the Irish Dental Council. As the review is still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the group's work at this time. I expect to have a report from the group by mid-2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible. Any recommendations made by this group in relation to improving prison health care services will be treated as a matter of priority by me.</P>
    <P>Because of often chaotic lifestyles on the outside, many prisoners present as requiring special medical attention in custody. The period of imprisonment often represents a real opportunity to address long-standing and damaging lifestyle patterns such as drug or alcohol addiction which undermine personal health and social competence. Prisoners can be a demanding group as patients but their demands are often quite reasonable and their period in custody represents a positive opportunity from a public health perspective.</P>
    <P>I have also recently obtained Government approval to proceed with a strategy to address the drug problem in partnership with the health authorities. This strategy emerged from a prison drugs policy review group which I established in late 1999 under the chairmanship of the Prisons Director General, Mr. Alyward. The new policy will entail the appointment of various professional staff as well as the training of prison officers. Already 49 nurses have been appointed to the Prison Service, including 16 in the remand prison at Cloverhill.</P>
    <P>Under my predecessors in office as Minister, methadone maintenance was not provided for prisoners who were compliant participants in such programmes prior to entering custody. I have reversed that policy and almost 200 prisoners in the Dublin prisons are on such programmes today. The psychiatric service is provided to the prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists. Offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the prison medical officer are in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment, may be transferred by ministerial order to either the CMH or a district mental hospital. In practice all such transfers occur to the CMH.</P>
    <P>My officials in the Department and in the Prisons Service are working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve the organisation and level of psychiatric input in prisons in the Dublin area. It is envisaged that the improvements in psychiatric care being developed through this dialogue will be extended, where feasible, to prisons within other health board areas.</P>
    <P>I have appointed a full-time doctor to the new prison at Cloverhill in Clondalkin, and propose to do so in the Midlands Prison in the near future. Both appointments represent a change in employment arrangements for prison doctors who hitherto were all recruited on a part time attendance basis. Over the past 15 months, the number of psychologists employed by the Prison <Col N="208" /> Service has increased from five to ten. The recruitment of further psychologists for the prison service is under way.</P>

    <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which will consider applications for a declaration as a refugee at first <Col N="209" /> instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which will consider applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the number of asylum applicants awaiting a determination of their application at first instance at 31 December 2000 is 10,127. The Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has informed me that the number of outstanding appeals as of the 31 January 2001 is 2,004 &ndash; 1,742 substantive cases and 262 manifestly unfounded cases. It should be noted that these figures for the RAC and RAT include applications-appeals made right up to the cut off dates in question.</P>
    <P>From information made available to me by the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, I understand the current processing time for asylum applications from initial application stage to the determination of an appeal, in cases where applicants avail of the opportunity to appeal, can range between four months for manifestly unfounded cases and two years. In cases where there is no appeal the processing time is between three and 20 months. Any legal action could extend that period further.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last year the Government agreed the allocation of major additional resources including the recruitment of 370 additional staff aimed at the speeding up of processing times in respect of asylum applications, including appeals, and to deal with the consequential increase in the level of repatriations of people whose applications for refugee status are unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The additional resources, including staff, being allocated to the Department are being utilised to achieve a number of strategic objectives, namely: greatly increasing processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period &ndash; which will ensure that those who are genuine refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that non-genuine applications will also be dealt with on a faster basis; the elimination of the asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible; and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused.</P>
    <P>While a large number of the additional staff are now in place and have either undergone or are receiving the necessary training at present, some outstanding staff are being recruited by a special competition organised by my Department which is being advertised at the present time.</P>
    <P>Since deportations commenced under the Immigration Act, 1999, I have made a total of 1,132 deportation orders. 222 persons have been deported &ndash; 6 in 1999, 187 in 2000 and 29 so far this year &ndash; representing 19% of deportation <Col N="210" /> orders made. In addition, a further 22 persons left the state before the deportation orders could be enforced.</P>
    <P>The following is the position in relation to the remaining cases; 353 persons evaded deportation orders; 164 persons were not at their last known address for the purposes of service; 207 persons have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts. Arrangements are being put in place in respect of another 49 persons. 60 persons will have to have their return negotiated with the authorities in their respective countries of origin. Deportation orders in respect of the remaining 55 persons are being, or have been, revoked primarily on the basis of legal advice.</P>
    <P>There are currently 98 judicial review cases before the court in relation to asylum matters. A further 128 cases are before the court involving deportation matters and, in those cases, approximately 15 include, in addition to the main deportation challenges, a challenge to an aspect of the asylum process. The Government is committed, as evidenced by the measures outlined above, to continue to develop more efficient and effective processes to deal with asylum applications; to eradicate, at an early date, the applications currently on hands and to continue to meet its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention both by identifying and protecting genuine refugees and by more quickly dealing with those applications which are clearly not from genuine asylum seekers.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Children born in Ireland to non-national parents are Irish citizens and have the same citizenship rights as other Irish citizens. In line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case, subject to the common good, a non-national who becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed reside in the State with that citizen. In examining such applications, my Department has regard to the terms of the Supreme Court's decision and in particular to the finding that an Irish citizen is entitled to the care and company of its parents <Col N="212" /> in the State, even if those persons have no other entitlement to reside here, subject to the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that records are not maintained in a manner that enables it to provide all the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the total breakdown of asylum applications refused refugee status at first stage since 1990.

      <P>The Dublin Convention provides criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU member state is responsible for considering an application for asylum submitted by a national of a third country in one of the member states. The convention was concluded by the member states in June 1990 and entered into force on 1 September 1997 for the original 12 signatories, on 1 October 1997 for Austria and Sweden and on 1 January 1998 for Finland.</P>
      <P>Article 63(1)(f2&gt;a) of the Treaty of Amsterdam commits the European Union to introducing an instrument to replace the Dublin Convention within five years after the entry into force of the treaty, that is, by mid-2004. The European Commission is using the opportunity provided by the treaty both to take stock of practical experience of implementing the Dublin Convention to date and also to reflect again on the principles on which the convention is based in light of the objectives established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the field of asylum.</P>
      <P>To this end, on 21 March 2000, the Commission submitted a working paper to the Council entitled, Revisiting the Dublin Convention, which provided an analysis of the functioning of the Dublin Convention. This paper was discussed at the asylum working party. The Commission followed this by circulating a questionnaire on the evaluation of the Dublin Convention to all member states in July 2000. The collated replies to this questionnaire form the basis of an evaluation of the convention, which will be brought to Council later this month. This evaluation will be an important input into the development of a Community instrument to replace the Dublin Convention. It is expected that the draft instrument will be tabled at the asylum working party for analysis and discussion in mid-2001.</P>
      <P>As the draft instrument has not yet been tabled, there is no indication as yet as to whether it will contain a common basic welfare provision, though this is unlikely. Welfare provision is more likely to feature in the proposed instrument on common minimum conditions for the reception of asylum seekers, which is expected in the near future. If Ireland is to become involved in the adoption and application of the proposed measure, this will require the exercise of the option under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The exercise of the option requires the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with Article 29.4.6 of Bunreacht na hÉireann. The matter will be brought to the attention of the Oireachtas at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently examining a proposal for an agreement between the European Union and Norway and Iceland which would extend the application of Dublin Convention arrangements <Col N="214" /> to those states. This is being proposed in the context of Norway and Iceland joining the Schengen area in March 2001. As this will also require the exercise of the option under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, I expect this to be brought to the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, entitles an employee to <i>force majeure</i> leave with pay from his or her employment for urgent family reasons, owing to the injury or illness of a family member. Under the Act, an employee is entitled to up to three days <i>force majeure</i> leave in any period of 12 consecutive months or five days in any period of 36 consecutive months. Entitlement to <i>force majeure </i>leave is limited to circumstances where the immediate presence of the employee, at the place where the ill or injured person is situated, is indispensable.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to carry out a public information campaign to provide greater public awareness of the right to paid <i>force majeure</i> leave provided for under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. The Equality Authority, which was established in October 1999, has as one of its functions a role to disseminate information to the public relating to entitlements under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. An explanatory booklet is available from the Equality Authority in relation to the Act. In addition, my Department issued an explanatory booklet in December 1998 in relation to entitlements under the Act. This booklet is available from the equality division of my Department and can be accessed on my Department's website &ndash; www.irlgov.ie/justice. The explanatory booklets give detailed information on the operation of the paid <i>force majeure</i> leave provisions.</P>
      <P>A review of the operation of the Act will be carried out by my Department this year in consultation with the social partners. In the event that recommendations are agreed in the context of the review and accepted by Government, the question of publicity needs arising from the review can be considered at that stage.</P>

      <P>Direct provision is the means <Col N="215" /> by which the State discharges its obligations under international law and the Constitution to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers. For the most part, it represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis. Reduced allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme are paid to take account of the full board accommodation provided. Asylum seekers can also apply for exceptional needs payments under the SWA scheme.</P>
      <P>Subject to satisfying a means test, asylum seekers are also entitled to medical cards. They are entitled to the same health services as Irish medical card holders and the children of asylum seekers can avail of free primary and secondary education.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, which introduced direct provision on 1 April last, and followed thorough investigation and planning. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum seekers is by far the best approach and the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, provides for the availability of advice and representation by a solicitor and, if necessary, a barrister to persons of modest means, at little cost, in civil cases. Aid is available for representation for proceedings in the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Courts.</P>
      <P>While at present the vast majority of the Legal Aid Board's case load comes from the area of family law, the Act provides for legal services to be available in a wide range of civil matters. For example, during 1999, legal advice was provided in 3,300 non-family matters and legal aid was provided in 146 such cases. Non-family law areas covered by the board on a regular basis include such matters as medical negligence, professional negligence, personal injury, contractual disputes, unfair dismissal, debt, property matters and landlord and tenant matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that advice and aid in relation to certain civil law matters are specifically excluded under the Act, including defamation, disputes concerning rights and interests over land, civil matters within the jurisdiction of the District Court Rules, 1993 &ndash; small <Col N="216" /> claims procedure &ndash; licensing, conveyancing, representation before tribunals and election petitions. However, a conveyancing service may be provided if the issue follows from a family law matter for which a legal aid certificate previously issued. There are also limited circumstances whereby representation may be provided in respect of disputes concerning rights and interests over land, for example, in cases where an agreement to marry has been terminated or if the issue concerns the family home and infirmity of mind or duress are suspected.</P>
    <P>The service provided by the Legal Aid Board is now widely accessible to the public.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. The total intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities, that is, Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna etc., have also placed considerable strain on the registry's ability to provide essential services. In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by <Col N="219" /> 77. The resultant appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management are implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy has noted, there is a huge divergence in cost between certain institutions. I would point out, however, that most fall within a broad band of between £45,000 and £53,000 per offender. As up to 80% of this cost is made up of staff costs, including overtime, much of the variation is due to the costs of staffing prisons with different security regimes, escort requirements and economies of scale.</P>
    <P>The major exception to this cost band is Portlaoise Prison which has historically contained some of the most dangerous offenders in the State, with the attendant high security regime and associated higher manning levels. However, it is planned to redeploy a large number of staff from Portlaoise to the new Midlands Prison which will have the effect of reducing the average cost of Portlaoise to nearer the average for the service.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period, in this case 1999. These running costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of prisoners in custody, that is, officers' wages and items such as lighting and heating.</P>
    <P>When looking at the cost of keeping an offender it should be borne in mind that this fig<Col N="221" /> ure is for keeping a person in custody, with all of the entailed costs, such as medical, educational and recreational, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. It is therefore not readily comparable with other types of institution. While it is of course the case that it is much less costly to apply a non-custodial sanction, involving supervision of the offender in a community setting, it has to be borne in mind that non-custodial sanctions are simply not a suitable or adequate way of dealing with the great majority of persons who end up in custody.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the relatively high cost of motor insurance in Ireland and, in particular, the cost for young drivers. This high cost is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers, whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority Road Accident Facts Report for 1999, showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>I would therefore welcome any initiative that might contribute to a reduction in the number of road accidents, especially those aimed at improving the safety record of young drivers, which can be expected to lead to a reduction in premiums. However, the area of insurance underwriting is a matter for the insurance companies themselves.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening in the underwriting and pricing of insurance. I also have responsibilities in law for the solvency of insurance companies. It would be for the insurance industry to consider what initiatives might be worthwhile of detailed examination, whether they would be workable and what impact they might have in relation to the underwriting of risk for a particular group of people.</P>

      <P>The Government and the Irish people have been particularly shocked by the strong earthquake which struck India on the morning of Friday, 26 January, India's Republic Day.</P>
      <P>In addition to measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, the epicentre of the earthquake was close to Bhuj city in the State of Gujarat and has caused enormous damage in terms of human life and injury. Reported to be the strongest earthquake disaster in India for over 40 years, this event is set to have a negative impact on regional and national infrastructures well beyond the initial emergency response phase. The Government of India has officially placed the death toll at 14,976 with 55,000 injured. Preliminary official assessments indicate that 35 million people have been affected.</P>
      <P>Recognising the magnitude of this disaster, the Irish Government took early action to support the international response and to provide immediate emergency relief for the suffering population. On Saturday, 27 January, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who has special responsibility in this area, announced bilateral emergency assistance of up to £1 million to support the efforts of the Indian authorities, international agencies and organisations already operational on the ground.</P>
      <P>The EU, through the European Community Humanitarian Office, initially announced &ndash; £3 million for immediate relief operations in Gujurat. On 31 January, the Commission announced a further £10 million in humanitarian assistance. As most of the current relief operations are focused on the major urban centres, ECHO aims to reach badly affected smaller towns and remote areas.</P>
      <P>To expedite the impact of Ireland's bilateral emergency response, an initial amount of £250,000 was made immediately available to the International Federation of the Red Cross which is co-ordinating with the Indian authorities in their response to the emergency. On Friday, 2 February, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met with a number of national and international NGOs to offer the Irish Government's support and to discuss their responses to the ongoing crisis. A number of organisations, including Trócaire, GOAL, Concern, Oxfam, Christian Aid, the Edith Wilkins Hope Foundation and World Vision, signalled their intention to submit emergency proposals to Ireland Aid, some of which are already being considered. The Government will continue its work, including with the relevant NGOs, to assist the Indian Government and people in recovering from the earthquake disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The human rights situation in Sri Lanka is a matter of concern to the Government. The two-decade long conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and secessionist Tamil elements has resulted in major loss of life as well as serious human rights violations, including violations of civil and political rights. Human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan security forces include extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrests and detentions. Of particular concern recently was the increase in violence during the Sri Lankan general elections in October 2000, which were monitored by a EU observer mission led by Mr. John Cushnahan, MEP. The murder of young Tamil detainees in Bindunuwewa also in October, while they were under the protection of the Sri Lankan authorities, was particularly shocking.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners have urged the Sri Lankan Government to bring to justice those responsible for these human rights violations. While recognising the efforts of President Kumaratunga to address this problem, we have also drawn the Sri Lankan Government's attention to the urgent need to provide the Human Rights Commission with the requisite human and material resources for it to do its job.</P>
      <P>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have, for their part, committed terrorist acts as well as gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including indiscriminate attacks, bombings and the conscription of child soldiers. These too have been firmly condemned by Ireland and the EU.</P>
      <P>The EU has further condemned the use of anti-personnel mines by both the Sri Lankan security forces and the LTTE.</P>
      <P>The EU has encouraged the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, which would take substantial account of the aspirations of the Tamil minority and not breach the principle of the territorial integrity and unity of Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the EU fully support the dialogue facilitator mission assumed by the Government of Norway since February 2000. We have noted the importance of the first meeting which took place between Norway's special envoy, Mr. Eric Solheim, and the leader of the LTTE, Mr. Velupillai Prabhakaran, on 1 November 2000. We have also noted the declaration of Mr Prabhakaran that his movement was prepared to enter peace negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government and expressed the hope that this declaration was sincere and will shortly lead to actual talks.</P>

      <P>Within the overall subvention arrangements provided to the CIE companies, it is the responsibility of Bus Éireann to determine specific services provided by it in west Waterford or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Government has increased substantially the amount of subvention paid to the CIE companies for the provision of socially necessary but non-commercial services. In 2001 the Government provided £159 million in Exchequer subvention for CIE. This is 51% more than was provided for in the 1997 Estimates. I commend Bus Éireann for its recent extension of rural transport services around the country. There are 35 such services in operation.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the national development plan of some £3.5 million for the development of pilot public transport projects in rural areas. One of the aims of this initiative will be to encourage community-based initiatives to provide bus services in their own areas.</P>
      <P>It is planned that the funding will be used to support a number of pilot rural transport projects in the period 2001 to 2003. The projects, to be funded by my Department, will be selected following a national call for proposals. My Department will be issuing in the coming weeks a consultation document on this subject which will seek the views of all interested parties on the method of allocating funds to projects. A three week consultation process is proposed and, shortly thereafter, applications for funding for projects will be invited.</P>

      <P>In the specific case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned was interviewed by his commanding officer in November 2000. His allegation that he was being bullied were discussed. The individual has made an application for transfer to another unit. The company commander later informed the individual in question that the requested transfer would not be possible because no appropriate vacancy exists in the unit to which he wished to transfer. The claims of alleged bullying and intimidation were investigated by the military authorities, who could find no evidence or foundation for the allegations. Shortly after the interview in November 2000 the individual informed his unit commander that he was applying for discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I understand that the facilities of the Defence Forces personnel support service are being availed of by the individual. The military authorities advise that the individual in question, a serving member of the Defence Forces, has available to him the &ldquo;Redress of Wrongs&rdquo; complaints procedures as provided by Section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954. Additional procedures are provided for by the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships in cases involving alleged bullying. These procedures have been agreed with the representative associations and have been brought to the attention of all personnel. There is, therefore, provision for redress through the normal military channels if a complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of a preliminary investigation. If a complainant is still dissatisfied, s/he has the right to have the matter referred on to the independent complaints inquiry officer who has wide powers of investigation and who reports directly to the Minister with his recommendations on each case referred to him.</P>
    <P>Personnel usually report any alleged complaints of bullying through the normal chain of command in the first instance. However, if personnel do not wish to report through usual military channels, they may enlist the advice and assistance of specialist welfare staff such as chaplains, medical officers, Defence Forces psychologists, members of the personnel support service or a liaison officer.</P>

In recognition of the difficulties created for herd owners by the delays in commencing valuations, my Department has arranged for interim payments of compensation and, in addition, is finalising arrangements for the granting of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the herd owners involved.</P>

      <P>The position is that some £360 million additional funding has been committed to the disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance scheme over the period 2001 to 2006. It is estimated that 109,000 farmers will qualify for payment under the new area-based scheme. Total expenditure in 2001 will increase by some £60 million to £180 million. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain under the new arrangements while about 28,000 will incur modest losses.</P>
      <P>In County Louth it is estimated that 864 farmers will participate in the scheme with 659 of these gaining on average £827 while the remaining 205 will suffer some loss. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in County Louth in 2001 will be about £35 rising to £70 in 2002. In the meantime, I have asked my officials to carry out a review of the scheme with a view to finding an equitable solution to the problem of losses.</P>

The previous national cancer forum considered appropriate developments for a number of specialist areas of cancer care and treatment and established working groups to review these areas.

Waterford Regional Hospital is one of the locations involved. The details of funding allocated under the national cancer strategy in the current year are set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum also established an expert working group to review radiotherapy services. The work <Col N="231" /> of this group is ongoing and it is expected that it will report by the middle of this year.I am committed to the further development of cancer ser<Col N="232" /> vices to ensure those who develop this disease receive the most appropriate, safest and most effective treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a revised assessment mechanism for chiropodists who wish to work in the public health sector. Following the settlement of a High Court case in November 1999, officials of my Department have been involved in discussions with the professional bodies representing chiropodists in Ireland with a view to agreeing the details of how such a revised assessment mechanism should be implemented.</P>
      <P>The revised assessment mechanism is being introduced in the context of the introduction of a system of statutory registration for a number of health and social care professions, including chiropodists. The aim of the revised mechanism is to ensure all who wish to practise as a chiropodist in the public health sector are suitably qualified to do so. These new measures will not result in the lowering of standards and those whose qualifications are not deemed suitable will be given an opportunity to upskill themselves. Only those whose qualifications are deemed suitable for public sector employment will be involved in carrying out the assessment procedure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the current waste management planning process is brought to a satisfactory conclusion as soon possible so that progress can be made in the delivery of improved waste services and the integrated infrastructure which is necessary to meet modern waste management requirements. Any further delay in making sensible long-term provision for the waste management needs of the regions concerned is untenable. I have considered all the available options in order to bring the planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion and I will make a statement on the matter at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The proposed plans based on detailed strategic studies undertaken in the region concerned, and having regard to the overall policy approach of Changing our Ways, were developed in accordance with all the relevant provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996, including public consultation. Accordingly, any legislative changes that might be introduced would not address the content of plans or specify any particular waste management infrastructure. The purpose would be to ensure the adoption, throughout the country, of regional waste management plans which adopt an integrated approach to waste management, respecting the widely accepted waste hierarchy.</P>

      <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, was enacted on 18 December 2000. This Act will provide, for the first time, a statutory basis for the designation and protection of natural heritage areas, NHAs, which are sites of ecological or geological importance from a national perspective. Provision for appeal has been written into the Act to ensure that landowners' property rights are taken fully into account in the decision making processes.</P>
      <P>Under section 16 of the Act, a landowner may object on scientific grounds to a site being designated as an NHA. It seems to me in that context that procedures similar to that currently applying to objections to SAC designations &ndash; including local liaison committees and an appeals advisory board &ndash; could also appropriate in the case of NHAs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> An appeals process is also provided for in section 19 of the Act, under which an owner /user may apply for consent to carry out works on a site that has been designated as an NHA. In the event of the owner/user being dissatisfied with the response of the Minister to such an application, section 19(7) of the Act provides for the appointment of an independent arbitrator for the purposes of hearing and determining the appeal. The Minister is bound to act in accordance with the determination of an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In general terms the consultation and partnership approach played a key role in bringing this Act onto the Statute Book with widespread support across all parties in the Oireachtas, as well as among NGOs and other interested parties. I believe that the objection/appeal mechanisms outlined above are fair and equitable and will help to balance the need to protect individual's property rights with the need to protect sites of natural heritage significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, the question of fully restoring Portumna Castle was considered by the consultants engaged by my Department to prepare the draft management plan for the Portumna Estate. The consultants recommended conservation of the castle itself rather than its full restoration. The reasons for this are to avoid conjecture in any such restoration; the need to study; preserve and present the fabric that does survive; and the possibility offered by the building in its current state of creating a unique experience not to be found elsewhere in Ireland. The complete restoration of Portumna Castle does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total expenditure at Portumna Castle in the years 1990 to 2000 exceeded £3 million and I have made an additional amount of £30,000 available this year to complete the installation of an oak stairway and an enhanced exhibition. I am of the view that a significant investment has already been made at Portumna Castle and that my Department's major objectives of providing <Col N="238" /> extended public access and an enhanced exhibition for visitors have been achieved.</P>

      <P>In the period, 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2000, permission to remain was granted to 2,473 current or former asylum applicants in the categories referred to by the Deputy. A total of 86% of the persons in question received permission to remain as the parents of Irish born children, 8% on the basis of marriage to an Irish national and 6% on the basis of marriage to an EEA national.</P>
      <P>Of the 977 cases on hand in respect of the categories in question, 73% relate to parents of Irish born children, 14% to spouses of Irish nationals and 13% to spouses of EEA nationals. The Deputy should note, however, that many of the cases involving parents of Irish born children relate to two applicants. Applications for permission to remain in these categories, as in all others, are examined individually and according to particular criteria with a view to ensuring the applicant in each case is in fact entitled to the permission to remain which has been sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the operation of manifestly unfounded procedures. In 1983 the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concluded (UNHCR EXCOM 30 (1983)) that national procedures for dealing with asylum applications &ldquo;may usefully include special provisions for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications which are considered to be so obviously without foundation as not to merit full examination at every level of the procedure&rdquo;. Manifestly unfounded applications have been defined as applications;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>not related to the criteria for the granting of <Col N="239" /> refugee status laid down in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or clearly fraudulent.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the use of these procedures is that an internal working group in the refugee applications centre examined the use of accelerated procedures to deal speedily with cases which are manifestly well-founded and manifestly unfounded. Arising from the deliberations of the group, workshops were held with the relevant staff in the case processing area of the refugee applications centre. As a result manifestly well-founded cases are identified where possible at an early stage to ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit of refugee status as soon as possible without being unnecessarily delayed. Manifestly unfounded procedures will help eliminate, at an early stage, applications which appear to have little or no relevance to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, (as amended).</P>
    <P>Since early 2000, the Irish authorities have sought to use these procedures to the fullest extent, initially in accordance with the &ldquo;Procedures for Processing Asylum Claims&rdquo; which were agreed with the UNHCR, and subsequently in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996, (as amended). The statistics below outline the progress in regard to use of manifestly unfounded procedures for the period January to December 2000.</P>

      <P>Female offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick Prisons. Sixteen year old female offenders are generally committed to institutions <Col N="242" /> which are run by the Department of Education and Science and are committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances. This can only occur in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children's Act, 1908, that the young person cannot be detained in a Department of Education and Science institution. Such committals are used only as a last resort by the courts and the number of 16 year old females committed to prison each year is low.</P>
      <P>My Department provides two centres for the detention of women: the Dóchas Centre at Mountjoy Prison, which I opened in September 1999, and a 12 place unit at Limerick Prison. Planning for a new, purpose designed facility for females to replace the existing facilities at Limerick Prison is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that there are appropriate facilities in place for the detention of young female offenders. The provisions of the Children Bill, 1999, currently before the House reflect the need to improve the manner in which young offenders are managed in the criminal justice system. The legal provisions for the committal of offenders under the age of 18 years will change on enactment of the Children Bill, 1999, which proposes that where a court imposes a detention on a child, it shall: (a) where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school operated by the Department of Education and Science; (b) where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, order the child to be detained in a place of detention provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, separate dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. In this regard the prison building programme includes provision for a 100 place unit with full support facilities in the Dublin region comprising separate secure detention for up to 20 females and 80 males. Sites, including some on existing State owned land, are being examined at present to identify a suitable location for this facility as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of these detention centres will be to afford young offenders the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to avoid future offending by the creative design of high quality purpose built facilities and the provision of high grade support services delivered through a progressive regime tailored to their special needs.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the group were,<i> inter alia</i>, to advise on the principle of pre-entry physical competence tests which would be objective and not gender biased and, in this context, to assess the operational, scientific or other relevance of a height requirement as a selection criterion for entry to the Garda Síochána. The report recommended,<i> inter alia</i>, that a job-related pre-admission physical competence test should be introduced for applicants wishing to join the Garda Síochána and set out the arguments that can be made, on the one hand, for maintaining or, on the other hand, abolishing the height requirement.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that under the provisions of section 4 of the Competition Act, 1991, auctioneers and valuers in Ireland may not engage in anti-competitive practices, including those which directly or indirectly <Col N="244" /> fix prices or fees. In this regard, it is a matter for each auctioneer to individually determine the level of fees that he or she will charge in what is, essentially, a commercial transaction. A prudent vendor would, therefore, be advised to shop around to obtain the best rate or fee before entering into an agreement with an auctioneer.</P>
      <P>I am informed that at present the market is served by a sufficient number of practitioners to provide vendors with choice and to generate competition. The additional benefit of competition is that it acts as a natural control on fee levels and, in this regard, provides an effective means of price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Joyriding is a complex problem which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can be tackled meaningfully and to lasting effect only through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving both the community and relevant statutory bodies. In relation to legislative matters, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have adequate powers under existing legislation to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner. I am further informed by the Garda Síochána that joyriding in the Coolock Garda sub-district is primarily a problem within the Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview areas. Operation Steering Wheel is a local response and <Col N="245" /> comprises uniform, foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. Local Garda management has also established a Garda resource unit to conduct patrols on a continuous basis and target known joyriders. The initiative has resulted in a 50% decrease in incidents of joyriding throughout the Coolock sub-district.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Oíche has resulted in an increased Garda presence in the area, which has led to a decrease in the number of incidents of joyriding and anti-social behaviour. In addition, my Department funds the WOODALE Garda youth diversion project, the catchment area of which incorporates those areas most affected by joyriding in the Coolock sub-district. The project aims to divert young persons from becoming further involved in anti-social and/or criminal activity through the provision of a range of suitable activities which promote personal development and improve educational and employment prospects. In October 2000, under the National Development Plan 2000-06, I launched a second Garda youth diversion project to operate in the Kilmore area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a task force on joyriding in the Priorswood area has also been established and includes representatives of Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána and various community and residents' associations. As a first step in developing a strategy to combat the problem, the task force commissioned a comprehensive research work, the report of which I officially launched yesterday. I now hope that the relevant agencies will engage with the local community to further develop and implement the strategic plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position in relation to trespass is that it is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In that context, the usual remedy which an aggrieved landowner will seek is that of an injunction. It is also the case that because trespass to land is actionable <i>per se</i>, it is not necessary to show damage in order to succeed although, if monetary damages are part of the remedy sought, it would be expected that appreciable loss would be proven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain situations, trespass may be dealt with under the criminal law. The criminal law provisions dealing with trespass include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The 1971 Act makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, to remain in forcible occupation or to <Col N="246" /> encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation. The 1994 Act makes it an offence for a person to enter any building or part of it, including its vicinity, with intent to commit an offence. It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person, and the gardaí have power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and/or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>Any alleged breach of the criminal law in this respect should be reported to the Garda Síochána for investigation with a view to a criminal prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Minister in 1997, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in the prison infrastructure which has virtually eliminated the unplanned release of offenders. In all over 1200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way. The prison system has reached the stage where it can accommodate almost all those sentenced by the Courts for the full duration of their sentences. I qualify these statements only by reference to the female prison population where we currently have higher than anticipated committal numbers and for whom extra spaces will be built shortly.</P>
      <P>As a direct consequence of the ongoing prison building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of temporary release of the total number of persons serving sentences from 19% in October 1996 to 6% in January 2001. The actual number on temporary release has fallen from a daily average of 550 in October 1996 to less than 200 in January, 2001. These figures offer incontrovertible proof that I have decisively addressed the chaotic prisoner management situation which I inherited on taking office in 1997.</P>
      <P>Almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service. Many of those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served, and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public. It is unfor<Col N="248" /> tunately the case that, despite the most careful assessment being made in advance, certain individuals will tend to breach the trust that has been placed in them and will re-offend. Other jurisdictions, sadly, have similar experiences.</P>
    <P>When temporary release is granted it is always subject to the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour. Various other conditions may also apply. For example the individual concerned may be subject to supervision by the probation and welfare service, he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station, or to reside at a particular location and so on. If any conditions are breached the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without the need for fresh proceedings.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service are now involved in over 50 community based projects around the country, the overall aim of which is to assist in the rehabilitation of offenders and reduce re-offending. The following is a range of the community based projects funded by my Department: drugs aftercare recovery group; alcohol treatment for offenders before the courts; youth service projects; community reparation project; offender-victim mediation project.</P>
    <P>Further such projects will continue to be developed in co-operation with the probation and welfare service and under the national development plan. The budget for the service has increased to over £25 million which is a 100% increase on the provision for this area since I became Minister in 1997.</P>

      <P>Under Article 5(2) of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended, one of the grounds upon which an Immigration Officer may refuse leave to land to a person arriving in the State is where the person, although wishing to take up employment in the State, is not is a possession of a valid permit for such employment. During 2000 a total of 149 persons were refused entry on these grounds. Where a person arrives in the State with a valid work permit they are generally granted leave to land without undue formality. Last year more than 20,000 non-EEA nationals were authorised to take up employment <Col N="250" /> here or were otherwise exempted from the work permit requirement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an arrangement has now been agreed between my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Garda national immigration bureau to deal with any future cases where a person arrives in the State with a validly issued work permit but where the job in respect of which the permit was issued no longer exists. Measures to give effect to those arrangements are currently being put in place.</P>

    <P>At 1 January 2000 there were a total of 1,351 persons subject to a community service order under the supervision of the probation and welfare ser<Col N="251" /> vice. A further 600 community orders were notified to the probation and welfare service in the period from 1 January to 30 June 2000 and 388 of these orders have commenced implementation by the service. Final figures in respect of the year 2000 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, persons who have a community service order imposed on them by the courts have twelve months from the date of the order to complete the number of hours work specified in the order.</P>
    <P>As regards the expansion of the use of this sanction, I wish to point out that the making of a community service order is entirely at the discretion of the judiciary, and the number of orders made over the years 1995-99 have been fairly consistent. If, however, the Courts were to have recourse to orders made under section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 more frequently, then any necessary extra resources required by the probation and welfare service will be provided by my Department.</P>

In this regard, I would point out that since I have taken office the strength of the Garda Síochána has been increased by approximately 800 members and I am on target to further increase the total strength of the Garda Síochána to an all time high of 12,000 by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including manpower, is a matter for the Garda authorities. In this regard, I am informed that the allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is carried out with due regard for a number of factors in the various Garda districts throughout the country. These factors, which have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of Garda personnel resources, include population, geographical area to be covered and crime levels. Furthermore, Garda manpower assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses where they reside three miles from the centre and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS. About 5,000 people participate annually on the vocational training opportunities scheme at an overall annual cost to the State of £32 million.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The £15,000 referred to in the questions represents the amount of grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees in respect of each group of 20 students. It covers expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The VTOS non-pay element of funding of £15,000 per core group of 20 students has remained unchanged since 1989. Because of limitations on resources, it has not so far been found possible to correspondingly increase the grant. However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. An adult educational guidance <Col N="254" /> service has been initiated on a pilot basis and a new management structure has been developed for the programme. The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <Quest>the progress that has been made in establishing a system of support for organisations representing survivors of child abuse; the agreements reached at a meeting held on 8 November 2000 with representatives of certain support groups; if the decisions were acted upon; the events which transpired at a subsequent meeting on 22 November 2000 which appear to have overturned the original decisions following the dispute and withdrawal of the original groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of services have been in place for some time which provide support for survivors of abuse in the first instance and for groups representing survivors. These include a serviced office in Cork and another in Dublin. Both of these offices offer information in relation to the various Government initiatives for survivors of abuse and public services generally. They also provide, or arrange, for counselling and education services for survivors. Both of the offices provide services for all survivors without reference to their membership of any group. In addition to these offices, my Department has been involved with a number of support groups for survivors in establishing a second office in Dublin. While playing a similar role to the other already established offices, as far as survivors are concerned, this office will have a more national focus compared to the more regional focus of the existing offices. This office will be operational within the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important feature of the national support office is that it will be managed on a day to day basis by a professional administrator. To assist the administrator and to ensure the relevance of the office and its activities to survivors of abuse, the administrator will be advised by a committee drawn from those support groups which support the objectives of the office. While a meeting did take place involving a number of support groups on 8 November it was an exploratory meeting only to discuss a range of issues. At a further meeting of 22 November there was disagreement among some of the representatives of the groups <Col N="255" /> present resulting in the withdrawal of some of the participants. However, the meeting went on to form a committee with representation from three of the most active and well organised support groups in the country. This committee is now operating effectively and constructively with the administrator of the office and I am confident that together they will provide an effective and valuable service for survivors of abuse.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some of those who withdrew from the meeting on 22 November now wish to join the committee. It is not my intention to interfere in the membership of that committee. Given that it is a committee formed from survivor support groups it is my view that the committee should determine its own internal affairs. The appointment of new members to the committee is a matter for the committee and any person who wishes to become a member should apply to it.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Kennedy Park National School, Wexford Town is without a remedial mathematics teacher or a home-school liaison officer and has a pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1; if the school will lose the additional teacher appointed in 2000; if he will grant full disadvantaged status to this school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation of the school referred to by the Deputy. This school has the services of a full time remedial teacher whose remit would include the teaching of mathematics. I assure the Deputy that Kennedy Park National School, Wexford town, will be considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing support services.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no immediate plans to expand the scheme.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current mainstream staffing of this school is a principal and 17 teachers based on an enrolment of 480 as at 30 September 1999. The enrolment as at 30 September, 2000, on which the staffing for the 2001-2002 school year will be based, was 466. As the staffing schedule for 2001-2002 has not yet been finalised, the retention or otherwise of the seventeenth teaching post cannot be determined at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last month I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. The school in question did not rank sufficiently high in terms of the level of disadvantage in the school to receive additional teaching posts. However, the school is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £8,070 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports. Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified solely through a survey of educational disadvantage in <Col N="257" /> primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year. Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a small number of longer serving school secretaries and caretakers in the primary system are very poorly remunerated and have failed to secure improvements over the years; if this matter is being addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Persons employed under this scheme are entitled to, and have received, pay increases as agreed in recent years under the various national agreements. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per-capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject <Col N="258" /> to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further increased in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of Community Employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department. One of the effects of a transfer of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department would be to remove the anomalies that exist in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from my Department whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants that are issued by my Department. The purpose of the discussions that are taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to my Department which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services.</P>
