      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is as follows: No. 5, Carers Leave Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed); No. 6, Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage; No. 1, Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>]: Second Stage; and No. 51, Statements on the Report of the Joint Committee on Education and Science on Science and Technology, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of Matters on the <Col N="262" /> Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that proceedings on No. 51, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and the main spokespersons of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes and Members may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House and that is the proposal dealing with No. 51. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we regretfully accepted the Chair's ruling which did away with the policy allowing Opposition party leaders to raise topical matters of interest on the Order of Business which were not necessarily related to legislation. I asked at that time that an immediate effort be made to amend the Standing Orders so that this morning we could continue with that practice. The Government has shown a marked reluctance to deal with this matter, which primarily affects Opposition parties. It is a right we gained that we have now lost. The Government is showing great reluctance to call a meeting of the necessary committee and to agree a motion. The Fine Gael Chief Whip, Deputy Flanagan, has tabled a very fair amendment to Standing Orders which has been circulated. I ask the Government to agree to that amendment to Standing Orders so that the procedure allowing Opposition leaders to raise matters of topical interest can resume. Obviously it cannot resume today but it should be in place for next Tuesday. If this continues it will be an effort to silence the Opposition and a clear indictment of the Government for wanting to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn should be quiet. He knows where he is sitting. Will the House agree to the amendment tabled by my party so we can proceed to restore the rights the Chair bestowed on Opposition parties which he felt he had to withdraw yesterday? It is not fair to those who elected us if the Opposition is silenced, as the Government is trying to silence us. Government Members can amend the Standing Orders again once they are returned to Opposition if they wish but we demand that this right is restored to the Opposition immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same topic, it is clear from the Chair's response to my letter yesterday that he has completely misunderstood the position of the Labour Party. I want to clarify the matter in relation to what Deputy Owen said and what the Chair wrote to me. My party does not feel it has a difficulty in participating in the work of the <Col N="263" /> Committee on Procedure and Privileges sub-committee on Dáil reform. We are resolutely refusing to co-operate with the charade of Dáil reform on one hand while at the same time the Fianna Fáil component of this Government wants to tear up the rules regarding general elections, rules that were agreed in this House. They want to have the capacity to raise not £2 million but £3 million from corporate donations and elsewhere going into the next election. Because of the revelations from the tribunals and the ongoing disrepute into which politics has been dragged by some members or former members of Fianna Fáil, this party refuses to co-operate in the charade of Dáil reform on the one hand through this so-called sub-committee while at the same time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government wants to tear up the rules that have governed very effectively and fairly the last five by-elections in this State. As the language used in the Ceann Comhairle's letter states that we felt we have some difficulty in participating in that Dáil sub-committee, I wanted to apprise him of our real position on this lest there was any lack of understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy I understand the position very clearly, but the point he made is a political matter, not one of procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs Owen Mrs Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Members on this side of the House suggested to the Chair yesterday that until such time as the Standing Order is changed perhaps he would reconsider his ruling yesterday and allow that procedure to continue, which I hope would be only for a matter of a few days until the Government wakes up to its responsibility. In the meantime he is unwittingly silencing the Opposition in its role here, which I know is not what he is trying to do. Given the reluctance of the Government to agree the amendment of this Standing Order, perhaps the suggestion made by Deputies Bruton and O'Keeffe yesterday would be one he might reconsider today and communicate with us on it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I strongly support the idea that the Opposition is allowed to raise questions of major importance of the day with the Taoiseach and that the Government is obliged to answer them. People around the country support the idea that urgent issues should be raised immediately with the Government and that we should have an immediate response to them. The proposal by Fine Gael is completely unacceptable to&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add the Green Party's voice to the feeling emerging that when Deputy Owen speaks, she does so as if she is speaking on behalf of all the parties in Opposition, but that is not the case. There is a need to be inclusive. The Chair might take that into account, as it is not in order for one person in Fine Gael to speak on behalf of all members of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Chair to restore the <i>status quo</i> that applied up to this week, as in that environment people will be much more prepared to discuss a change. If the existing facility to the Opposition is withdrawn, that will put the Government in a position to dictate whether there will be a new Standing Order and, if so, its terms. I beg the Chair to allow the parties to discuss the new Standing Order starting from the <i>status quo,</i> which is the one that applied up to yesterday. If he does that, he will provide the atmosphere and the environment whereby each of the parties will be encouraged to carry out his suggestion, which I emphasise is very good one, that we should make sure that the rules conform to the practice. I urge him to do that. If he does that, I am convinced there will be no difficulty in getting the Standing Order agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request from Deputy O'Keeffe that the <i>status quo </i>should obtain until such time as what Deputy Quinn suggested would be given an opportunity. For a variety of reasons, this House is seen by those outside it as not being relevant. With all due respect to you, Sir, if this measure proceeds, it will shut down the relevance of this House, diminish its status and its ability to raise issues of current interest that are being discussed everywhere outside this House but under this ruling may not be raised within it. With respect, it would be absurd if we cannot raise issues of topical interest as they arise spontaneously in this House. Anything other than that is a diminution of the stature of this House. We have always done that with the Ceann Comhairle's distinguished predecessors and with him until quite recently. I do not know <Col N="265" /> the provenance of this measure. It is most unfortunate. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to rethink it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of this House is conducted in accordance with Standing Orders and that is the way it must continue. The Members determine Standing Orders; the Chair only implements them. The Chair does not introduce or change them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to disagree with what the Chair said about Standing Orders. It is precisely because of that we in Fine Gael drafted an appropriate Standing Order, which would meet his suggestion that topical matters should be allowed. When he introduced the latitude that was enjoyed by Members, he did so in consultation with Members. There was a feeling on the part of Government and its representatives that this was an attempt on the part of the machinery of this House to allow for topical matters to be raised to make this House a little more relevant to the people outside it. In the course of the debate yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated and volunteered to the House that he is spending too much time here and answering too many questions. He does not want to be accountable to Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have spoken on this matter and I have listened attentively. There are a number of inaccuracies in what has been said. The first major one is that none of the Chair's distinguished predecessors allowed this system that the Chair introduced. What Deputy Rabbitte said about that is entirely inaccurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair brought in a system which he believed was appropriate to the modern operation of the House and I totally supported it. I was the first Taoiseach to operate under those rules. I did so and I would always follow not only Standing Orders but also the precedents of the House, which the Chair and his distinguished predecessors have built up in practice. This measure was one the Chair introduced and I complied fully with it day in and day out for the past number of years. The Chair formalised that measure <Col N="266" /> in a number of statements. I would be glad to do that again in the future, as per the Chair's ruling.  The Chair's ruling was abused many times and everyone has watched that happen, but I have continued to comply with it irrespective of what happened.</P>

As the Chair suggested yesterday, the Government parties have called a meeting for next Tuesday at which the Government is prepared to discuss and agree that and other issues.</P>

      <P>Why has the Government only promised publication of that legislation in mid-2001? This means the earliest it can be discussed is late 2001, if at all, and that the totally unsatisfactory nature of the waste management system in Ireland will worsen. What is the Minister for the Environment and Local Government doing in his Department? He has not kept any of his promises. Two years ago, he said a tax on plastic bags would be introduced. He is now suggesting that matter will be dealt with in the Bill. What is he doing and why is he in Nairobi instead of here dealing with this crisis?</P>

    <Title>Carer's Leave Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>An employee is required in sections 9(1) and (2) to give six weeks' notice to his or her employer about the commencement of carer's leave. In subsection (2), where it is not <Col N="278" /> reasonably practicable to do so, the employee should give notice as soon as is reasonably practicable. This is very woolly and perhaps some certainty can be given. At times, the reason a person needs care, such as a stroke, happens out of the blue and the carer of such a person would not have the opportunity to give six weeks' notice to his or her employer before the proposed commencement. Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;Where it is not reasonably practicable to give notice in accordance with the period specified . . . [the six weeks] . . . the [carer] shall give that notice as soon as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;. That implies that, if it is not six weeks, it would be a certain time before the commencement. However, as I said, it is often the case that events happen which cause the carer to have already left employment. That provision should be tightened up.</P>
      <P>Section 9(4) states that, when an employee has not given six weeks' notice or has not given notice as soon as is reasonably practicable: &ldquo;the employer may, at his or her discretion, treat [the] leave as carer's leave&rdquo;. The employer has this discretion but does he or she also have the discretion to decide that the employee has quit his or her job if proper notice has not been given? Is this the type of case on which a rights commissioner can adjudicate? Would it not be reasonable in this case for an employer to be able to go to a rights commissioner to obtain some certainty in that matter?</P>
      <P>Section 9(6) states: &ldquo;An employee who is on carer's leave shall, not less than 4 weeks before the date on which that employee proposes to return to his or her employment, give notice in writing to the employer of the intention to return to work&rdquo;. Can an employee not give a progress report of the care on a monthly basis to the employer to keep him or her informed of the prospective situation concerning the employee's return to work? That means the employer is kept in the picture and he or she can make tentative plans regarding the employee's return to work. Obviously another person has filled the job in the interim and consideration must also be given to him or her. A monthly report or a timely progress report may be the correct approach to take.</P>
      <P>Sections 10(2) and (3) relate to the confirmation document, one copy of which the employer must prepare, sign and retain and give another to the employee who must also retain that copy. Many conditions, duties and responsibilities are attached to that confirmation document for both employer and employee. How will this be made known to them? It is another part of the bureaucracy for an employer. To remember all this, he would need a training course in the Irish Management Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;if the relevant person is in receipt of full-time care and attention from a person other than the employee concerned&rdquo;, the carer's leave shall terminate. What is the position if this happens earlier than the date signed up for and agreed in the confirmation document? If it happens that full-time care in a hospital or nurs<Col N="279" /> ing home is given to the person cared for substantially prior to the date on which the carer has stated in the confirmation document he or she would return to work, is the employer obliged in such circumstances to take back the employee earlier than previously agreed? What is the position on that?</P>
    <P>The same situation arises in sections 11(2)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) where a deciding officer makes a decision where &ldquo;the employee will not provide or is not providing full-time care and attention&rdquo;, for example, the person cared for is not a relevant person, or &ldquo;the employee is engaging or has engaged in employment or self-employment&rdquo;. There is a question, especially where the person cared for is not a relevant person and the employee does not provide full-time care attention, of what happens in that case. Does the employer take the employee back six months earlier than the date in the confirmation document?</P>
    <P>In Part 3, section 13, which deals with the protection of employment rights, what is the position regarding statutory redundancy should a business fail? Is the carer's leave period included in the number of years taken into account in the calculation for statutory redundancy? What about special or top-up redundancy payments made over and above statutory redundancy payments? Is the carer's leave time also included in that?</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to the conditions under which an employee returns to work. Under section 15(2)(<i>b</i>), &ldquo;the terms or conditions of the contract relating to the place where the work under it is required to be done&rdquo; are not to be substantially less favourable to the employee. However, what happens if the company has moved location and the new location is substantially less favourable? I know of cases where, for reasons of economy, such as the raw materials being at a better location or a greater availability of employees, a business may move from Dublin to Castlebar. What is the position in relation to that carer-employee if they are not to be in a substantially less favourable employment location? That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with redress which may be ordered for the party concerned as the rights commissioner or tribunal considers appropriate, but in cases where the decision is that the employer has been wronged in some way, what sanction may be specified in his or her favour? While the tendency has been in all employment legislation to date to place the emphasis on the employee to his or her benefit &ndash; rightly so &ndash; should there be a case where for any reason the employer has been badly wronged, can an award of compensation be made to him or her for determined negligence or wrongness on the part of the employee? I am not saying that this would happen regularly, but it could happen occasionally. I am delighted that the Bill has been introduced and look forward to it being adopted and many people using and benefiting from it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> In a major development it was announced in the budget that the income disregard was being increased for a single person from £75 to £125 and for a married couple from £150 to £250. This will benefit and provide a great boost for 5,000 people at the lower end of the pay scale and who are not doing as well out of the economy as others. I am delighted that it has come into being. They represent a significant portion of the total number of carers in the country. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proper that the Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House. I join those who have welcomed it. We have been told that it is unique to us. The Minister of State said, &ldquo;This Bill is a first, not just in Ireland, but I would confidently say in Europe&rdquo;. He may be right; if so, I welcome that fact as I am all in favour of initiative, but did the Minister of State check the position in New Zealand? One often finds that measures which have not been tried before in Europe have been tried in New Zealand. When Minister of State with responsibility for children, I was very surprised to find just how radical they had been in New Zealand. It may be the case that they have thought of this also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say a poor thing but our own, but that would not be fair. It deserves a better welcome than that.</P>
      <P>Anything to do with assistance for carers is welcomed in the House &ndash; rightly so. The more affluent we become, the more we require carers. Strangely enough, the more affluent we become, the less caring we are in some respects. When I used to live in the North, while it was still not enough &ndash; we are talking about Thatcher times &ndash; much more money was available over a long period in all sectors. When I made the transition to the South I found that we were dependent on the voluntary sector to a much greater extent; that people in the North received payments on items on which people did not receive payments here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was forcefully brought to my attention soon after my arrival when electioneering in Dublin West. When I knocked on a door in a working class area I was appalled by what I saw. As a small frail woman attempted to talk to me, the door which she had left slightly open was wrenched backwards and she was almost pulled off her feet by a young man who was obviously mentally handicapped, about three times her size and perhaps ten times her strength. This startled me. She had great difficulty in stopping him from getting out. When I contacted her later by telephone I found that she had not been out of the house for four months, not even to go to mass. She had a husband who was useless and who spent most of his time in the bookies and the pub. She was left to look after the young lad in ques<Col N="281" /> tion. I was appalled to find that she was not receiving any assistance. That would not have happened in the North. It drew to my attention the discrepancies between North and South and the extent to which people who were incapacitated and disadvantaged in this State depended on voluntary effort, for which I express my appreciation.</P>
    <P>I have also noticed that, as we have become more affluent, fewer people are involved in voluntary effort and more and more appear to be demanding payment for work which, just a short time ago, they were prepared to do for nothing. I am not suggesting that people should have to perform many of these tasks for nothing, they should be paid for them, but it appears that the effect has been that, as we become more affluent, we are less community-minded in terms of voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>To qualify for carer's benefit an employee has to meet a list of criteria, the first of which is that he or she must be 16 years or age or over. The Bill enumerates a further seven qualifications. Is it necessary to stipulate that a person must be 16 years of age or over? Is it possible for a person to be just over 16 years of age and qualify under the other criteria? What is the youngest age at which it will be possible for a young person to satisfy the requirements? Is an age limit of 16 years required?</P>
    <P>The Bill is consequential on social welfare commitments. Three conditions were laid down in the Social Welfare Bill &ndash; sufficient stamps, a medical examination conducted by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and spot checks to provide proof that full-time care and attention are being provided. The most that anyone can receive is £96. For someone who has taken a year or 15 months out of permanent employment this could amount to a substantial drop in income. Given that the employee may be taking time off to look after a person who in other circumstances would have to got into a hospital or a home, there are considerable savings. Is £96 the most that can be paid considering the savings that are being made? A sum of £96 is not a big deal.</P>
    <P>There are not any EU directives in this area and Ireland is taking the lead in this respect. I am surprised there is no EU directive. I wonder why that has not been the case in terms of the social objectives that the EU continually emphasises.</P>
    <P>IBEC has raised certain objections to and ICTU has certain reservations about carer's leave. IBEC would like to extend the qualifying period while ICTU does not want any such period. Perhaps that should be examined on Committee Stage. I assume the Minister has had representations from both sources.</P>
    <P>Job sharing is another matter which arouses my interest. Could difficulties be created in this regard? An employee can be a carer during the week and somebody else, presumably a relative, can do the job at the weekends. An employee who has taken carer's leave is entitled to spend <Col N="282" /> up to ten hours doing other work but to qualify under the legislation the second carer must work 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.</P>
    <P>Is it possible for a person to take leave from his or her permanent job to become a carer and then take up another job?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the health dimension of the provisions in the legislation and the saving that will accrue in terms of the cost of placing a relative in a nursing home, for example, and I ask the Minister to examine the £96 payment again in that context.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the legislation are particularly useful and attractive in cases of terminal illness. That aspect appeals most to me. For example, if a close relative of someone working in the Civil Service has a terminal illness he or she would be able to take time off work and be with their relative whether it is for a matter of weeks or months. I entirely approve of that humanitarian aspect of the legislation. I assume in those circumstances that the requirement for prior notice will not apply. It would be a nonsense, if one were notified that a close relative had a terminal illness, to have go through the procedure of giving weeks of notice and would defeat the purpose of the exercise. I absolutely take that for granted and I expect the Minister to reply in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in regard to bank and public holidays. An employee seeking carer's leave in the normal course of events is entitled to payment for such holidays or is given another day's leave for working on those days. There is a difficulty in applying that fully in the case of those who take carer's leave. Provision will only be made for such payments for the first 13 weeks and it is unfair that only the first 13 weeks are counted in this regard. Will the Minister of State examine that?</P>
      <P>I refer to the position of a carer returning to his or her permanent employment because there may be some gaps. For example, what effect would taking a year or 15 months out have on redundancy payments? Is this covered by this or other legislation? What would happen, for instance, if an employee took a year off under the legislation and then returned to find the firm had gone bankrupt in his or her absence? He or she could not be offered an alternative job. Presumably, there is a right of claim to the rights commissioners. I read sections 15 and 21(2) in this context but it is still not clear where responsibility would lie. What would the redundant employee's entitlement be in those circumstances? Would redundancy be paid out of the social insurance fund, for example, or would he or she have any entitlement? I will tease that matter out on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this community who can be deviously minded. What would be the position if someone recognised that his or her firm was in trouble and likely to go bottom up and took <Col N="283" /> carer's leave under the provisions of this Bill? There is a recognition that he or she would inevitably have to sign on but if they took carer's leave they would be entitled to £96 per week and also, possibly, some other entitlement under the redundancy terms. Ever since I read about Daniel O'Connell and the coach and four or coach and six I have been a great admirer of people who are able to find their way around these entitlements. However, I still believe there are circumstances where we ought to do our best to stop them.</P>
    <P>By inclination and experience I tend to be on the side of the employee rather than the employer. However, the provisions of this Bill could create considerable difficulties for small employers. The difficulties could also arise at short notice, for example, with regard to the most valuable part of this Bill which is the provision for an employee to take carer's leave to care for somebody with terminal illness. In those circumstances and at short notice, considerable inconvenience could be caused to an employer. In a small firm where two or three people are employed, somebody leaving at short notice could cause more than inconvenience, it could be a serious crisis for the employer. While my sympathy lies to a great extent with the employee rather than the employer, I recognise that serious difficulty could be caused for small employers. That should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's reply to this debate and to further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing this legislation. The Bill provides a new entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid carer's leave to enable them to care for persons who require full-time care and attention. It is a worthy ambition.</P>
      <P>There are two Departments involved with carers but principal responsibility lies with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Everybody is familiar with the carer's allowance and carer's benefit schemes which were introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. One of the welcome announcements in the last budget was that the income disregard for a married couple is to be increased from £150 to £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a natural progression in the arrangements for carers. It is an important measure. Deputies encounter issues relating to carers every day. One restriction that applied to carers in the past was the requirement that the carer must live in the same house with the elderly relative or the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; as they are described in the Bill. In recent years this restriction was removed <Col N="284" /> and the carer had only to live near the elderly relative. That allows the latter to continue to benefit from the free schemes which, although they will now be available for all people over 70 years, irrespective of who is living with them, were not necessarily available to people under 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>Given that the current nursing home subvention is £120 per week &ndash; it will be increased in April &ndash; it is important to keep the carers system under review and, hopefully, increase the carer's allowance and benefit to the same rate as the subvention. The Ombudsman spoke about this recently in the report on subventions. The system was rightly described in the Seanad yesterday as requiring more accountability and responsibility. There was a presumption, the Ombudsman said, that young people would always look after their elderly relatives. That is no longer the case and there is probably a strong case for abolishing the means test for carer's allowance. I hope the Government will examine those issues.</P>
    <P>One attractive aspect of the Bill is the flexibility with regard to the 65 weeks entitlement. The time can be taken over a continuous period or in separate periods. There should be greater flexibility in relation to the number of elderly people who are turned down because they are not regarded as sick and do not qualify on medical grounds. This issue has been the subject of many appeals to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That Department will still be responsible for assessing whether a person is in need of full-time care and attention. It is important to ensure the best medical advice is available in that regard and that people will benefit more from the carers system.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that on the resumption of work following a period of carer's leave if it is not reasonable and practical for the employer to permit the employee to return to the same work he or she did prior to the leave, suitable alternative work and terms and conditions not less favourable to the employee shall be provided by the employer. That is an important provision. We have seen what happens when people go on career breaks. I am thinking, in particular, of teachers within the vocational education system who may not get back into the same school and might be required to work different hours.</P>
    <P>We should be careful with the arrangements that are put in place for people who might get alternative work. People might already have child care and travel arrangements and the ideal situation would be for the person to return to their original employment. However, that is something which should be dealt with weeks before the person returns to work.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of financial implications. As there are two Departments involved, there will obviously be much negotiation between them. There will be the issue of employers having to recruit temporary replacement staff while the employee is on carer's leave. There might be difficulties for employers in that regard and that will <Col N="285" /> require discussion and negotiation. Again, we will have to be on the side of the employee. It should be possible to resolve that difficulty for the employer.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern for employers is being given sufficient notice before an employee commences carer's leave. The Minister said the employee must be in continuous employment for at least 12 months. That might appear harsh but I presume the reason is to give the employer sufficient notice. However, there is also the situation where an employee might change employment. This is happening more frequently now. Employees frequently change employment in this era due to the myriad job opportunities which exist. Perhaps the Minister would consider reducing the 12 month qualifying period for those employees who wish to apply for leave.</P>
    <P>Some carers may look after more than one person. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs recognises this through the provision of an increased payment in such circumstances. However, the value for money being obtained must be borne in mind. The cost of nursing home care for two relatives would be significantly higher than that for one person and the carer's allowance should reflect the level of additional cost involved.</P>
    <P>The legislation refers to circumstances in which an employer may refuse without reason to permit an employee to take carer's leave for a period of less than 13 weeks. IBEC has pointed to some difficulties in this regard. Conflict could arise between employees and employers and I would welcome some clarification from the Minister on the rationale behind this provision. I am sure most employers will facilitate employees in taking leave.</P>
    <P>The question of what constitutes full time care and attention has been the subject of much discussion within the Department. Alarms, security pendants, telephones and other devices are now available to elderly people and it has been established that carers do not have to provide 24 hour care. Social welfare legislation provides for breaks for carers, to which they are properly entitled. It is important that the best use is made of new technologies for elderly people as they will also benefit the carers on leave from employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time. I compliment the Minister and his officials for producing this timely, comprehensive and socially important Bill. The legislation is a further building block in the construction of a new Ireland as set out by this partnership Government in the programme agreed following the last general election. It also delivers on the promises made in the Fianna Fáil manifesto prior to that election and the Government's commitment to social partnership enshrined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an element in a wide-ranging and comprehensive Government plan to improve the <Col N="286" /> conditions of carers who provide a vitally important social and community service to people who, through ill health or incapacitation, cannot take care of themselves. The Government has done much to improve financial and other supports for carers because it values the contribution they make to society. The Bill is a further Government measure to promote social inclusion among all walks of life, particularly disadvantaged categories.</P>
    <P>In a society in which formal community and family support structures and values are declining, the Bill seeks to support and underpin the position of those who care for people who cannot care for themselves. The Government wishes to improve the quality of life for all citizens and will not allow itself to be deflected from this objective, certainly not by any trivial gossip. The Government has been repeatedly criticised, wrongly at times, for what is perceived as its obsession with reducing tax rates and a failure to spend money on health services, etc. The reduction of the tax burden on ordinary workers is completely justifiable as it allows them to retain an ever-increasing proportion of their income and spend it as they wish. It is vital that people are allowed to exercise freedom of choice in regard to the manner in which they spend their money. This Bill will allow people to leave work for a particular period of time to work as carers and to return to employment thereafter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by some of the Bill's provisions. Some companies offer share options to staff but, in certain cases, if an employee is not working on the day the deal is signed, he or she cannot participate in the ESOP. I am sure the Minister will tighten up any similar provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The lot of carers has significantly improved under this Government. Some 16,000 carers are currently in receipt of carer's allowance. In 1998, additional benefits such as free travel passes were provided through the budget for carers over 66 years. The 1999 budget provided free telephone rental to carers and the relaxation of the full-time care and attention rules permitted carer's allowance recipients to take up paid employment for up to ten hours per week. That budget also extended the allowance to carers caring for people between 16 and 65 years of age and to those caring for recipients of the domiciliary care allowance. It also provided a respite grant of £200. The respite grant was increased to £300 in the 2000 budget. A back to education allowance was also extended to carers whose caring responsibilities ceased. A carer's benefit scheme was introduced and a free electricity and telephone allowance was extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has commissioned a consultancy study on the financing of long-term care in an effort to shape future policy direction in this area.</P>
    <P>The recent budget increased the carer's allowance by £10 for those over 66 years and by £8 <Col N="287" /> for those under 66. The income disregard for the purpose of means assessment was increased from £75 to £150 for single people and from £125 to £250 for couples. Many carers welcomed that provision which they saw as an appreciation of their role. The respite care grant was further increased to £400 and two grants will now be paid to carers who look after two or more people. These are practical and caring measures and it is important that supports and benefits continue to be allocated to carers. With the increase in the nuclear family and the consequent fragmentation of the extended family with its traditional culture of care, more and more people, particularly those with duressed conditions, are being cared for in hospitals and nursing homes rather than in their homes as was referred to by Deputy M. Kitt earlier.</P>
    <P>This places extra pressure on scarce facilities for which demand always exceeds supply. Many of the people receiving institutional care of one type or another would be perfectly capable of being cared for adequately in their homes. If a personal carer, either family or friend, was available to them, this would be the way to do it and it would take significant pressure off the system.</P>
    <P>Arguably, many of them, if this were possible, would enjoy a better quality of life as well arising from being in their homes and receiving personal attention from a dedicated single individual. There is as much psychological as well as physical comfort to be derived from such an arrangement by those who are cared for. Additionally, an increase in the numbers of those personally cared for in their homes would free up the scarce beds in hospitals and other institutions for those for whom personal care is not an option. Ireland can only benefit socially and economically from an extension of arrangements like this.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome as it enables those who wish to care for designated persons in need of care for an extended period while retaining the comfort and security of knowing their jobs, referred to earlier, will be there for them when they return from completion of their period of caring. The legal employment protection conferred on employees under the Bill strikes a fair balance between the needs of the individual, the employer and society. I have read that and there is no need for any of those parties to worry about it.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the protection placed increased burdens, as Deputy Currie referred to them, on the employer in a tightening labour market. I am sure, however, that the Minister of State will examine the points made and that they will be rectified.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, and his officials once again for a job well done. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="288" />
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I congratulate the Minister of State on his efforts to face a significant problem and a real life situation. Most representatives in the House will agree that some of the hardest things they hear in their clinics and so on are from people in the business of caring for a relative.</P>
      <P>It is not easy, most of the time, to care for someone that needs care. It is an emotional and stressful time. When we speak in terms of the Celtic tiger and so on, it often strikes me, and I am sure it occurs to the Minister of State and everyone else concerned, that it means little to these people. The problems they must face, sometimes on a 24 hour basis, day in, day out, are such that they feel frustrated and left out of this world of great development and economic figures and so forth.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is welcome in the sense that someone in employment wants to take time off and that this must be put into legislation for that situation to happen from the employee's point of view, it highlights again that the area of carers and caring is one of the major issues in society today. Much has been done in the recent past but overall a substantial amount must still be done. Allowing someone to take time out from their permanent employment recognises that, not alone is the person that needs to be cared for an immediate problem, but that the carer has taken this necessary decision to take time out.</P>
      <P>One of the toughest problems we must deal with is that of a person in receipt of social welfare benefit who is also a carer. The social welfare benefit of which they are in receipt immediately rules them out of entitlement to carer's benefit. That is an outrageous situation.</P>
      <P>It is a cop-out by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the sense that a person is getting a benefit or a pension and that that is it. If that person wants to care for someone it is up to them after that, for, as far as the Department is concerned, they are in receipt of a benefit from that Department in their own right, whether they care or not. Immediately, once they care for someone they are ruled out of an entitlement to carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Some extensions, until 1 April, are in vogue to broaden the income limits for carers. This is welcome but when one examines the overall situation it becomes clear that this is not really known. Most people agree that over 100,000 people are carers. When one goes down the list one reaches the figure of approximately 15,000 people who are in receipt of carer's allowance. Of that 15,000, approximately half are on the full allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the overall situation is recognised, I hope the Government, in whatever time it has left, will pursue and complete the situation as regards giving every help and recognition to the carer. Nothing in health care is more important than helping, recognising and subsidising &ndash; which is more important again &ndash; that situation where a person cares for someone in their home on a full-time basis and that the carer feels the <Col N="289" /> State indicates that it is thankful, that they do a good job and that it cares about carers. Who, however, really cares about the carers? That is the important situation.</P>
    <P>Again, the technicalities of this Bill will be teased out on other Stages. It is a recognition of the overall situation and of the ongoing problem in health care, care for the elderly and carers for people with disability. That is also an important aspect.</P>
    <P>I again compliment the Minister of State for introducing the Bill. I emphasise that it is important for the Government to recognise in real terms the plight of carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to share my time with Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
      <P>I too, compliment the Minister and welcome the Bill. Since this Government came to office in July 1997 it has prioritised the needs of the less well off and disadvantaged in our society at every opportunity. While there has been much economic progress in recent years, there is a moral and legal obligation on legislators to help those who do not have broader opportunities in our society. This Government has brought about the largest and most substantial changes in our social welfare code in modern history.</P>
      <P>The largest increase in social welfare benefits in the history of the State was announced by the Government in the budget of December last. Increased moneys are now being allocated across a range of social welfare initiatives and programmes. I support this policy. We must continue to increase social welfare payments on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I will recall briefly the key changes in our social welfare system which were announced in the recent budget. These included an expansion of the free schemes programme; improved support for our children by increasing the level of child benefit; an expansion of the free medical card holders scheme; lowering the higher and lower rates of income tax; widening tax bands to further reduce the level of income tax that has to be paid by PAYE and self-employed workers; a weekly increase for pensioners aged 66 or over; disability benefit has been increased by £8 per week for a single person and £15 for a couple; tax relief is now also available to an individual in respect of medical expenses incurred on behalf of a dependent relative; and there will be increased financial support for new nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the free schemes programme, which includes electricity and gas allowances, a television allowance and a telephone allowance, to all persons over 70 regardless of their income or who lives with them. I also welcome the fact that the entitlement to a medical card has been extended to all people over the age of 70. These are extremely innovative and constructive changes in our social welfare code as medical costs increase as people grow older.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> From the perspective of my constituency, I have held extensive discussions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, on the need to secure greater financial resources for St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastlewest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I organised a recent visit by the Taoiseach and both Ministers to meet officials, administrators and patients at the hospital. I am confident that increased moneys will be made available to St. Ita's Hospital in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am also in contact with the administrators of the hospital and the Mid-Western Health Board to ensure that the new unit for the elderly infirm at St. Ita's Hospital is constructed as a matter of urgency. This will improve the quality of care for elderly infirm people who will be patients in this hospital. The Government has allocated £550,000 for the construction of this unit.</P>
      <P>All employees will be better off when the budget 2000 tax measures come into effect from April of this year. PAYE taxpayers, particularly from the lower and middle income earning brackets, will be the primary beneficiaries of the income tax changes announced recently. The budget 2000 income tax changes will mean a significant improvement in the take-home pay of all employees. A married couple earning £20,000 per year will now gain up to £71 per month in take home pay. A married couple earning £25,000 will gain up to £86 per month in take home pay.</P>
      <P>The Carer's Leave Bill currently before the House for our consideration and for which I have commended the Minister is an intrinsic element of the Government's Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is designed to give effect to a carer's benefit payment and a parallel rise in carer's leave. This is part of the ongoing Government programme to bring forward new measures to help the less well off in our community. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for a new entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid carer's leave to enable them to care personally for a person who requires full time care and attention.  </P>
      <P>Since this Government came to power, it has focused on the need to give greater financial support to carers who play such an important role in caring for those who are unable to care for themselves. In the budget of December last year, it was announced that there would be a change in the means test for the carer's allowance which will ensure 5,000 extra carers will qualify for this benefit. The annual respite care grant is also to be increased by £100 to £400. Carers who are looking after more than one person will receive a respite care grant of £800. That tax relief will now be available to an individual in respect of medical expenses incurred on behalf of a dependent relative will also help reduce financial outlays committed by carers on a weekly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> Carer's leave is reckonable for the purposes of employment rights other than superannuation and certain public holidays. Disputes about certain entitlements under the Bill are in general referable to rights commissioners with the right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Issues arising in relation to this matter will focus on whether a person in respect of whose care the leave is taken is a relevant person to benefit from the provisions of the Bill and whether an employee is providing the full time care and attention as required by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 9, at least six weeks prior notice in writing is required from the employee to the employer outlining his or her notice of intention to avail of the entitlement to carer's leave. The terms of leave will be constituted in a document which is known as a confirmation document. Generally the leave terminates on the date specified in this confirmation document. The leave may also terminate on another date specified in the agreement between the employee and the employer concerned.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with employment rights for the employee on carer's leave. Section 13 states that an employee on carer's leave will be treated as if he or she had not been absent so that all of his or her employment rights will be unaffected during the leave. A period of probation or apprenticeship may be suspended during the carer's leave if the employer considers that its continuation would not be consistent with the carer's leave. Periods of carer's leave are not to be reckonable as any other type of leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to see legislation like this before the House which gives a legal right to employees to take time off although, as public representatives, we probably deal more with the carer's benefit in our constituencies rather than the legal right. Up to now, when sickness hit a family, the person had to depend on the good will of the employer to co-operate with time off or whatever. Some employers would have been helpful, others would not and a formal right in legislation for employees is welcome.</P>
      <P>Society has changed. People always looked after those who were ill in their families. Those people do a great service. Traditionally, that care was given by more women than men who took on the responsibility and the work but now that more people work outside the home, there is a need for such legislation because in many homes there is no one to provide the support when problems arise in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some respects my comments will be similar to those of other speakers who referred to carer's benefit as well as carer's leave because they are intertwined. The payments are not great and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should have been more innovative when introducing these schemes and offered optional extras. For example, a parliamentary question tabled last year suggested that an additional 0.1% <Col N="292" /> or 0.01% in PRSI would give up to £100 extra in widow's pension to women who find themselves in this unfortunate position. The same case can be made for those in receipt of carer's benefit. I do not know why the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has not been more innovative and offered employees the option to pay an additional 0.1% or 0.01% in PRSI in case they need £50 or £100 in carer's benefit in ten, 15 or 20 years. If employees were given this option I believe they would take it up.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the leave will terminate when the employee ceases to personally provide the full time care and attention to the relevant person. Many sick people who are cared for at home may need to go into respite care or hospital for a month or six weeks. I hope confusion does not arise in this regard. It is simple enough if a person receives respite care for a week but in some instances the case may be complicated and the period may be longer. I hope this is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the employee must be in continuous employment for 12 months. Why is this the case? The two Departments are trying to align their schemes but this provision seems to have been copied from the rules governing some other social welfare benefit. If I was an employer I would be much more worried about giving leave to a person who had worked for me for ten years than I would be about giving leave to a person who had worked for me for six months. A person who has worked for a company for six months is not an integral part of it and his absence would not have an earth shattering effect on operations, whereas the absence of a person who has worked for a company for a longer period would upset the employer and affect operations. This provision was probably suggested by IBEC but I wonder if it is necessary as giving leave to such people would not be a problem for an employer.</P>
    <P>Why is it proposed that only one employee may be on carer's leave in respect of the person being cared for at any one time? This is daft. The carer's scheme may have gone off the rails in some respects. Some people are receiving £80 or £90 in carer's allowance under what I would term the rent a granny scheme. These people care for their grandmothers at home but in most cases they do not need care and would be living at home in any event. We all know of cases involving seriously ill people who need 24 hour care. If the health board was involved there would be four carers working eight hour shifts. In cases where people are seriously ill I fail to see why two members of a family cannot be allowed to take leave so that one could do the day shift and the other could do the night shift. I am talking about cases where there is a major medical need and not about what I flippantly referred to as the rent a granny scheme. Given that the average industrial wage is £300 nobody will look for leave or apply for carer's benefit of £80 per week for the fun of it. They will look for leave only when there is a severe and immediate need at home and they believe the <Col N="293" /> care, love and attention they can give to a loved one is better than what they will receive in an institution. The people who work as carers are doing society and the State a favour; they are not spongers. If they walked away from their responsibilities it would cost the State much more to look after them in an institution. I hope this provision is changed so that people who are critically ill and need 24 hour care receive it and that more than one member of a family may take carer's leave to look after them.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the provision which will enable an employer to refuse, without reason, to permit an employee to take carer's leave for a period of less than 13 weeks. I would like to see this provision watered down. The logic in having such legislation is because some employers are not reasonable and will not play ball with their employees. There may be other provisions which are not as stark as this one and which provide for exceptions. I do not understand why a person who has taken leave to look after one parent must have returned to work for 12 months before he take leave to look after his other parent. This is a bureaucratic decision, wherever it came from. In some cases couples can get sick at the same time and die within a short period of each other. It could very easily happen that a person who had taken carer's leave for 65 weeks to look after one parent may need to take additional leave because his or her other parent does not have the will to live and becomes sick very quickly. I fail to see why this provision is being included as it might be better from an employer's point of view if an employee took a second period of leave fairly quickly after returning to work rather than waiting for 12 months when he or she has become an integral part of the company. I do not pretend to have an insight into the mind of IBEC but I find it difficult to believe that this proposal was put forward by an employer's group.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the provision under which six weeks notice must be given. People do not get sick to order. Many of the people who avail of carer's leave have had an ill parent at home for a long time and have been managing and getting by. Then in a crisis the parent goes into hospital for a spell and is then deemed well enough to go home. That constitutes the crisis which is not something that has happened overnight but has been happening slowly for a while. I understand, too, that an employer needs time to organise things and replace the employee.</P>
    <P>Generally the legislation is very welcome. It is necessary. If one could rely on employers being sensible, it would not be needed. There are a few aspects of it which I would like to see sharpened up. I hope that will happen on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Finucane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives us the opportunity to look at the issue of carers. I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this innovative Bill. It is unique as there are no similar models in the rest of <Col N="294" /> Europe, and Ireland might be leading the way in this whole area.</P>
    <P>The recognition of the importance of carers here is a new phenomenon. For years the work of carers and their commitment to family members went unrecognised. People were expected to do it and it was taken for granted. Now, at last, society is recognising this work and Governments are recognising that carers must be rewarded and supported for very good economic reasons as well as for social reasons. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 family carers in Ireland at the moment and these figures vary as well. Of these, it is estimated that between 12,000 and 16,000 receive a carer's allowance. In his budget speech the Minister for Finance said that provision for a new means test would bring 5,000 more carers into the net, but that means there will still be a large number of people caring for family members and relatives and, in some cases, non-relatives, who will not receive any benefit from the State.</P>
    <P>An issue that increasingly comes to my attention is that of respite for carers. Somebody who is house-bound for whole days with an Alzheimer's patient who requires constant care needs a break occasionally. At the moment there is no provision to allow people to take a break just to relax and re-energise themselves. This is serious because looking after someone who has Alzheimer's is very demanding on the person who is doing the caring because the person who has Alzheimer's requires constant care and attention, especially if they are mobile. In such cases, there should be provision in the system to allow the carer to get a break.</P>
    <P>The National Carer's Association is becoming more effective as a lobbying group. It needs more funding at national level to develop a network of carers' resource centres across the country. Where such centres are in existence and are well funded, they are very effective. However, large areas of the country are without carers' resource centres, and funding should be provided, through the National Carer's Association in co-operation with the health boards, to set up such centres.</P>
    <P>The contribution of carers to our society is now being recognised and this Bill is a response to that. This Bill is very important from a rural perspective. A large number of people working in Dublin come from rural areas. They include both single people and those with families in Dublin. Some of them have left a parent at home and they are continuously under pressure to get back at weekends to care for them. I am aware of a number of single people who come back to various villages and rural areas in my constituency every weekend to care for an old person. While the benefit provided for in this Bill is not adequate, it at least allows them take a break from work to care for their elderly parent, and now that it exists it can be improved upon. People can be happy they at least made the effort to help a mother or a father. If they can spend that year with them it might prepare them to go into residential care <Col N="295" /> because the parent would see the great sacrifice being made on their behalf and might consent to go willingly into residential care. There are people who just do not want to leave their own hearth and look on it as the last step if they have to do so. This Bill will facilitate the transition and encourage a change in the attitude of old people to the prospect of moving from their house. In that sense the Bill is very important.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the saving to the State. Alzheimer's residential care centres charge up to £350 a week. They need that amount of money in order to provide adequate staffing and to care properly for these patients. When one compares the benefit in question, which is £96, and the cost of keeping somebody in residential care, the saving to the State is considerable. The case for increasing the benefit has been made by other speakers.</P>
    <P>A number of studies reported recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> show that, despite the efforts being made and which I welcome, large numbers of people receive inadequate services. One study by the National Council on Ageing and Old People, which was launched last December, stated that there are about 32,000 people suffering from dementia and their carers get little help from the social services. It warns that although old people want to stay at home, the failure to provide an effective community care system means that more and more people are going into nursing homes. If there were more care workers, including nurses and other support services, working in the community fewer people would be in nursing homes. The study outlined that there are an estimated 97,000 households where a carer looks after a person aged 65 or older and these carers are mainly women. This area poses a major challenge to Government. We will have an ageing society and that will demand a response from Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a step in the right direction. The emphasis on care is extremely important. As Deputy Deenihan said, with an ageing population there will be much more pressure on our systems. In many cases people will be cared for at home. That is the ideal response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent budget relaxed the means test for carer's allowance to some extent. It was envisaged that an additional 5,000 people would be eligible for carer's allowance. There is a rigidity to the means test which sometimes is not sensitive to the applicant's circumstances. For example, a person with a severely mentally handicapped young child is eligible for a domicilary care allowance of £114 per month, that is about £26 per week. In many cases, in order to look after the child, the carer gives up his or her job. The concept of individualisation and giving extra rewards to people who are at work compared to those who stay at home was introduced in the previous budget. People in that position have no choice <Col N="296" /> other than to give up their job because they love their child so much they want to give full-time care to the child. A system that does not allow flexibility to respond to such a case is most unjust.</P>
    <P>The health boards should respond to cases. I was approached this week by a young woman who is trying to look after three young children. Her elderly parents came from another county to live with her. One is aged 87, the other 83. She is trying to maintain and care for them. They are not in good health. She wishes to look after them in her own home. She wants to get a hoist from the health board but it could take a considerable time before she receives it. If such people had to be cared for by the State it would be far more costly. This person is not eligible for carer's allowance because of the means test but we should be able to respond to such cases by at least giving carers whatever they require to assist them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to Alzheimer's disease and St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastlewest. I live in Newcastlewest and am aware of the tremendous work that is done there. We had three tours recently, to the facility in St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastlewest &ndash; one by Deputy Cowen when he was Minister for Health, one by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and one by the Taoiseach. The Government is conscious of the facilities there. The hospital has been looking for a new Alzheimer's unit for some considerable time. Perhaps a positive response will be forthcoming when an election is imminent. There is a great advantage in being from a marginal constituency &ndash; there will be many grand tours by Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach. We are probably unique in west Limerick in having three senior Government people visit this facility. However, the time for visiting is over. Now is the time for action. The design tender is with the Department of Health and Children. It must respond and provide the finance to let us get on with building the facility. At the end of the day, we cannot have the position, as exists at St. Ita's Hospital, where there is a dedicated Alzheimer's unit yet many other patients are locked in to cater for others who suffer from Alzheimer's disease.</P>
    <P>Look at the Jack &amp; Jill Foundation and the work it does for people with serious handicap, those with multiple sclerosis and so on. The health board will say that a person has a long-term illness card but must pay for doctors' visits and so on because the family does not satisfy the means test. I wonder at the degree of rigidity and inflexibility that exists. Is there a lack of awareness of the great work that is done by those caring for others at home, be it elderly or young people? Such carers are unsung heroes. This hideous means testing debars many people for consideration for carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>We do not have an effective community care system. In areas where there is a home help system in operation, the number of hours is limited to two, three or ten as the case may be. The home help organiser operates within a budget and has <Col N="297" /> limited flexibility regarding the number of hours she can offer to people living on their own who wish to avail of the service. At the same time we see phenomenal layers of administration and bureaucracy in health boards. It is time to have a root and branch review of the health care system to ensure that we respond to the needs at the coal face. That is not the case at present. We do not only need to talk about waiting lists, patients waiting on trolleys and all the other difficulties but about the community care aspect and what can be done to respond to cases where people are being looked after in their homes. Those who respond with love, dedication and commitment to looking after people in a home environment get very little support from the State. There is a time for flexibility. I have cited some cases but every other Deputy could give examples of where a response should be given.</P>
    <P>Ireland has changed dramatically recently. We have what could be regarded as full employment. In many instances there is no longer the extended family and there is pressure on the system. There has been a growth in nursing homes. It is my understanding, although it has not yet been clarified by the Department of Health and Children to the health boards, there was funding in the budget to increase the subvention to private nursing homes. My local health board has told me it may be introduced on 1 April and that the three different subvention levels will be increased by about 25%. It is imperative that the Department of Health and Children make an announcement now that the nursing home subvention rates will be increased. Many people are put to the pin of their collar to pay the differential between the present subvention rate and the private nursing home charge. It is important that people know the level of subvention has been increased. That would help in filling the gap between what they are paying and what the nursing home is charging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and his officials on introducing this important and progressive Bill. For 70 years Fianna Fáil has been at the forefront of introducing pragmatic and progressive social legislation and this Bill fits into that category very well.</P>
      <P>For a long time since the foundation of the State our nation was beset by poverty and we were not able to pay for all we wanted for our people. However, lack of financial resources was never seen as a sufficient excuse to deny assistance to those in the community who needed it most. It is surely fitting that at a time when the country enjoys an unprecedented level of economic success, Fianna Fáil retains its commitment to social legislation by aiming to use our wealth to help those who are sick, old, disabled or unable to enjoy the fruits of prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also fitting and appropriate to seek to reward all those who wish to provide care and <Col N="298" /> from that commitment the decision to institute a carer's benefit scheme arose. Such a scheme is worthy and long-awaited. There are many people in our community who have contributed over the years to building today's society. Age and hardship have taken a heavy toll on many of them, necessitating constant or near constant care. Similarly, a disabled person may need constant attention. In other cases there may not be a permanent need for constant care. For example, a serious accident or bout of illness may lead to temporary incapacity which, when followed by a sufficient period of convalescence combined with care, will allow the person to look after themselves again or at least not need constant care.</P>
    <P>All current medical thinking favours the ideas of supporting care outside medical institutions and of promoting care within the community. That can be done most effectively in a home setting. Hospitals must and should be resorted to when the need arises but in many instances an adequate standard of non-medical care can be provided outside a hospital setting, often in a person's own home, where a person feels happier and more content.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the carer's benefit scheme, a laudable innovation in itself, has led to this Bill. We are fortunate as a generation to live at a time when the workforce has grown at an unprecedented rate and the financial inducements to those wishing to make a living outside the home are so tempting. The Government has shown its commitment to family-friendly legislation, especially in the area of employment, where there is a constant need to retain and, where possible, nurture a balance between the demands of the workforce and the needs of home. There can hardly be a more pressing concern than that of a close family member, parent or child, who needs to be looked after constantly. All Members know of people who have given up employment permanently to look after an infirm or disabled relative. This has always been a great sacrifice and often went unrewarded or under-rewarded. A person lucky enough to be in the right profession might get a pension, yet even in this scenario the person making the sacrifice probably turned his or her back on promotional outlets and better pay.</P>
    <P>Legislation was needed to complement the carer's benefit scheme, which sought to assist and reward those who make such an important and worthwhile gesture but who naturally wish to return to the workforce at the end of the 65 weeks period for which the benefit is paid. This Bill gives legal protection to the employee's right to leave but more importantly, it cements the employee's right to return to a job as he or she left it, as far as possible. In short, the status of an employee who has the desire and compassion to take leave in order to provide for the needs of a person, probably a close relative, will be no different from those of his or her colleagues who remain in employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains some very sensitive provisions. Section 11 provides that the person being <Col N="299" /> granted leave may continue that leave for six weeks after the death of the person for whom they were caring. This is an exceptionally humane measure, particularly when the subject of care may have been a parent or child. It recognises not only the practical aspects of mourning but also the psychological elements of personal loss and must be welcomed by society.</P>
    <P>Another example of the Bill's realism and pragmatism is the provision allowing the carer to engage in limited self-employment or education while receiving benefit; it would be rare for even the most dedicated carer to be expected or physically able to provide assistance for 24 hours of every day. Also, the carer's entitlement for payment for 65 weeks will continue even if the subject of care changes to another person. An example would be if the person being cared for dies and a close relative or spouse needs assistance.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides some very effective guarantees for workers who take carer's leave. We are constantly told that we live in a fast-changing world, so it is probable that the type of work performed by an employee prior to their departure on carer's leave will have changed when they return. Section 15 provides that when this happens, the employee is to be offered work as similar in nature to their previous type and conditions of employment as possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill has emerged from the spirit and policy of partnership which has been the cornerstone of this and previous Governments' economic and social policies. Its provisions have been worked out with both unions and employers' organisations. Both sectors are supportive of its aims, provisions and objectives. It is possible that a rogue employer might try to penalise an employee contemplating taking carer's leave through redundancy, downgrading of employment or the threat of either or both. I am glad the Minister of State has provided for this and that employees' rights to protection against this are clearly spelt out. Furthermore, carer's leave will not be confused with the employee's rights and entitlements to other forms of leave. Where a dispute emerges between an employee and a boss concerning carer's leave, the employee will have a right of appeal to a rights commissioner and, ultimately, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The legislation aims to safeguard the rights of those in employment who want to avail of the carer's benefit scheme while ensuring the system is not abused and that the rights of the employer are not taken for granted. Rogue type employers are an unrepresentative group. The response of the vast majority of employers to employees seeking carer's leave is one of understanding and sympathy. As a result of the slight delay in the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme and the passing of the legislation on carer's leave, it is noteworthy that quite a number of applications for leave have already been submitted, the vast <Col N="300" /> majority of which have been handled with pragmatism by individual employers. Far from wishing to interfere or curtail the right of an employee concerning carer's leave, it is realised in the legislation that employers may want to go beyond the provisions available, say, in the amount of leave they may wish to give to their employees.</P>
    <P>This Bill was prompted by the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme, but it should be seen as far more than a mere legal appendage for it introduces the right of employees to carer's leave independent of the carer's benefit scheme. If an employee does not qualify for the payment for whatever reason, he or she is still entitled to take the stipulated 65 weeks' leave in order to provide constant care for a person found to be in need of it by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That person's employer is not bound to pay the employee during that time, but the employee is entitled to re-enter the workforce in his or her former place of employment with the same rights as a person who has received payment of the benefit.</P>
    <P>This legislation establishes important rights for people in employment who want to help those less fortunate than themselves. It continues a fine Irish tradition of seeking to help people who make such important sacrifices. The benefits of this legislation will be felt for many years by all those who are able to avail of the help, companionship and care perhaps of a relative or close friend. For them the very existence of somebody on whom they know they can rely is invaluable.</P>
    <P>This Bill demonstrates that prosperity as a nation can be combined effectively with continued humanity and the introduction of further progressive social legislation, particularly to help the less well off and those in ill health.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous Dáil, the Acting Chairman chaired the family affairs committee which produced a valuable report under his guidance. That report called for the introduction of many of the measures that have been introduced by the Government by way of this legislation introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, by a number of measures introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane rightly called for further improvements in regard to income, particularly income disregards in the means test for the carer's allowance. I hope those income disregards can be progressively improved over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing this important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a wonder<Col N="301" /> ful provision that a maximum of 15 months' leave would be available for carers. It is a recognition of the wonderful and unsung work that has been done by so many carers over many generations. Perhaps that work comes more to attention in some respects in an era when there is so much pressure on people to work outside the home, so many other demands on people's time and a different ethos in relation to how people want to conduct their lives. Much of that is welcome and a good deal of it is positive, but there are some negative aspects. It is extremely important that every attempt should be made by the State as a player to balance the needs of the workplace with those of individuals and their families. Every Deputy will have come into contact with families who have suffered enormously as a result of the burden of caring. In the majority of the cases I have dealt with, people who have undertaken the role of caring have done so in a great spirit of life and ability and not in a complaining, negative manner. That is one of the great aspects of caring in a family situation or in a professional milieu, which is not always adverted to and it is very seldom credited to people that they undertake the work with such a great spirit.</P>
      <P>This legislation is greatly important to many people. It is long past time recognition was given to the provision of the option of having leave from work to undertake the difficult but wonderful work in human terms of caring for another human being in need. Only in recent years have we come to recognise formally and in a meaningful way how that impacts on people's lives, the role of carers and the need to make monetary and other provisions to ease the caring burden on families.</P>
      <P>As some previous speakers said, the Carers' Association has become a good deal more active, politically vocal and critical of many of us. Some of them might think we would look askance and unwelcomely on that, but the opposite is the case. The case it makes is one that needs to be made by people who have experience of being carers, as many of us have not had personal experience in our families of being in a caring situation.</P>
      <P>I am almost afraid to mention the range of people involved, as in trying to refer to some I would inevitably omit some categories of carers and categories of people in need of caring.</P>
      <P>In every community there are MS suffers, who are frequently young people. I mention young people, not to divert attention from the needs of elderly people but to draw attention to the fact that generally speaking we have talked about carers in the context of their caring for older people, but that is changing rapidly. That is partly due to diseases, such as Alzheimer's and MS, that appear to be more prevalent than they were in younger age groups and partly due to the large number of those involved in accidents, particularly road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with a case recently of a husband, a farmer, who has cared for his wife, an MS suffer, for more than 20 years and he has also had to do <Col N="302" /> his work during that time. The introduction of a few minor measures could address some of that family's difficulties The means test, as it stands, has an absolute disregard for those caring for chronically ill people. I appreciate there are costs involved in extending it but surely it would be possible to extend the limits for those caring for people in need of 24 hour care. In the case to which I referred, the cost of homeopathic drugs, which are not covered under the medical card scheme, is about £75 a month. It is one of the minor matters that could be addressed, that would ease the burden on that family, although there are other major elements to their burden which would be difficult to address. Some respite care would also be of assistance in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware of another case where a young father in his 30s is an MS sufferer, his illness is at such an advanced stage he cannot be cared for in the home and is being looked after in a nursing home for the elderly. I have no doubt that, with the will and a little financial expenditure, provision could be made for a person such as him to spend a considerable period at home, perhaps even most of his time, with some care elsewhere. I have experience of people who are victims of accidents. I have amassed a great deal of information over the past two years about people to whom I did not advert in the past in terms of the poor provision for individuals who are victims particularly of brain injuries and of other physical injuries arising from accidents. Tremendous work is being done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I recently received figures from one of the associations involved regarding the total number of people admitted to hospitals with head injuries over the past five or six years. In each year, the total is in excess of 10,000 people. Not all of those individuals will end up with chronic long-term brain damage or be unable to participate fully in society. However, that will happen to a percentage of them and there is a need for a range of services for them. Almost 70% of them are young males aged between 17 and 25 years. This huge number of people all have a normal life expectancy and they will need to be cared for over a long period. Sadly, due to road accidents, this number is increasing rapidly.</P>
    <P>A number of organisations have been active in this area and I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for the enormous help they have given particularly regarding the millennium grant towards the provision of a hostel adjoining the national rehabilitation hospital in Dun Laoghaire. This will be of enormous assistance to families who suffer as associates and relatives of those who have been injured. Tremendous progress is being made, but occasionally one cannot help but feel that it needs a better direction and a handle put on it to ensure all the agencies and Departments work together.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has particular responsibility in the area dealt with in the Bill. However, it extends over so many areas that one needs to draw attention to <Col N="303" /> the fact that other agencies are working in a similar and related field. Perhaps one of the great aspects of the Bill is that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has recognised the needs of people in an area which, in many respects, is different from his area of responsibility. I welcome this and we should be open to the experiences of people in other jurisdictions. In that regard, the practices-challenge-respond initiative is under way in Northern Ireland and people are seeking to bring it to the Republic in the area of support services, particularly accommodation. They have a wonderful record abroad and they have offered their expertise to various Departments and agencies in this country. I am glad the Department of the Environment and Local Government and others have taken note of what these people are prepared to do.</P>
    <P>We must accept that we depend hugely on the willingness and capacity of individuals within families to take on a caring role. We need to support them, as is the case in the Bill, but we must also recognise that sometimes the job is too big. Occasionally there is a need for respite care and outside support. There is a need for a national network of agencies which help people with regard to respite care and occasionally long-term domicillary care. We are heading in the right direction, but carers need us to move more quickly.</P>

      <P>They are tried and trusted. I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill. It is welcome legislation and I compliment the Minister and his Department on its introduction. It has been said that it is unique in Europe. There are times when we are lectured by our colleagues in the European Union about the need to take directives on board. As a member of the Committee on European Affairs, a fortnight rarely goes by without us being handed down various diktats from Europe. Perhaps Europe could learn from us in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various measures regarding parental leave, maternity leave and the national minimum wage in addition to the proposed legislation on the protection of part-time employees. This body of legislation is a product of the consensus &ndash; some might say it is unwelcome &ndash; that exists between the social partners, voluntary organisations, etc. Much of the debate on this welcome legislation has centred on the social welfare provisions with regard to carers. Over the years, thousands of people throughout the country have, in the spirit of neighbourliness, friendship and family, worked voluntarily without any recognit<Col N="304" /> ion or assistance. In recent years, the boundaries have been pushed out in terms of recognising such people in the social welfare code. Measures such as the increase in the respite care grant, back to education opportunities and other allowances are extremely important and make a huge difference.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill concerns me &ndash; my colleague from Dublin North West also adverted to it &ndash; and this is the requirement that six weeks notice must be given when an employee is making an application for leave from an employer. As Deputy Noel Ahern said, people do not get sick to order. Will the Minister reconsider this matter in conjunction with IBEC, which, I presume, is driving this proposal? I hope it is being driven to a lesser extent by the trade unions. Perhaps a greater degree of flexibility could be introduced into the measure. I understand where the six week requirement might prevail in a large operation, but it might be possible, in circumstances where there is a good working relationship in a small company in a town or city between an employer and an employee, to reconsider how the application for leave might be processed more quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned medical certification and it is included in the explanatory memorandum. However, I am concerned about this matter and I hope it can be streamlined. There is a danger that good legislation can be stymied by bureaucrats. We are all aware of cases where matters are referred to a deciding officer under an appeals system. However, cases can be kicked around and this type of legislation could land in the lap of the Ombudsman very quickly. In many cases people must take leave to look after a person who suddenly becomes ill. I am aware of a case involving a young man who is suffering from MS &ndash; he tells me he is the youngest patient in Europe with the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The MS sufferer who was recently diagnosed, to whom I adverted, is only 25 years of age. His carers in the family will undoubtedly require several extended periods of leave. Perhaps as the use of the legislation evolves, there may be a need to amend it to take account of such cases.</P>
      <P>When people must take leave from work to look after one parent, often the second parent subsequently loses the will to live and the period of 12 months has not passed before the second parent requires assistance. That is another aspect of the Bill which needs to be looked at. Perhaps the flexibility to which the Minister referred in this speech may take account of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference to the great work done by the Carer's Association. There is no doubt but that it is provoking further progress in the area of caring. At long last it is being recognised that there is a need across a range of Departments for <Col N="305" /> a greater level of interventions. To a certain extent, some Departments are more ready to respond than others. I laud, as I have done several times, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the way it has adapted and now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is doing so through this legislation. However, there are Departments, such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as illustrated in the way the disabled person's grant scheme is devolved down to local authorities, which are not as flexible or as responsive as they ought to be. I recognise that the maximum grant was increased in this year's budget but building costs have increased astronomically. Whereas building costs vary in different parts, in the Dublin area where I am based it is now impossible to get a house extension built for a disabled person for less than about £35,000. That is an area which Government needs to look at.</P>
    <P>There are other small aids like smoke alarms, intruder alarms, bus passes, etc., which we need to look at providing as of right, to carers and people who are being cared for. We sometimes are inclined to think that we can pigeonhole all these issues and that we will be hunky-dory if there is an annual incremental increase in each budget.</P>
    <P>The means test is a contentious issue. The case of the Carer's Association in that regard has been well made and I am satisfied that the Government's commitment is evident in the way it has expanded it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is an enormous step forward in the area of employee legislation. It is enlightened. It is innovative. I hope it will be implemented in the spirit intended by the Minister. Since it arises out of social partnership, there is a better chance of that happening. I would ask the Minister to look at the two points of concern to me: the requirement to give six weeks notice to apply for leave; and the length of time which must elapse before one may apply for a second period of leave. Apart from those two reservations, I am very happy with the Bill and commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. While I welcome the Carer's Leave Bill, I am somewhat disappointed by the restrictive nature of it, which will present difficulties for many carers who would like to take time out to look after their relatives who are seriously ill. Deputies Carey, Killeen and others referred to that here, and my colleague, Deputy Broughan, the Labour Party spokesperson, referred to it yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will seek to have the Bill significantly amended on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is a country person, will see to it that some of the amendments which I, and I am sure Deputy McGrath and others will table, will not be taken in a spirit of begrudgery but seen as attempts to enlighten the <Col N="306" /> Bill and ensure that the welcome thrust of the Bill is achieved as we all hope. We have well founded concerns which have been set out here by other speakers and I hope the Minister of State will engage in that process in a spirit of openness and embrace the amendments put forward.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to refer to the carer's benefit, which was introduced in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, and which came into effect last October. Recent figures indicated that the uptake of it has been abysmally slow. While one welcomes these measures and initiatives, if they are not being availed of, something must be wrong. Perhaps the time lag between the introduction of the carer's benefit and this Bill has something to do with this poor take-up. Up to mid-December, only a dozen out of 75 to 80 people whose cases were with the Department had availed of it. That is very low. While all parties in the Dáil promote legislation as stridently and stringently as they can, it is important we make progress and that we do not introduce legislation which does not have a positive impact upon people's lives, especially those involved in the caring profession and who care on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass, and I am sure, neither will my colleague, Deputy McGrath, without reflecting the concern of carers who have been neglected by the Government. The Government is tinkering at the edges of the carer's allowance and let no one resile from that fact. It is a way of saying that we will let another 5,000 or 6,000 through the eligibility trapdoor this year but that we will not let anyone go further. There have been no real benefits for carers and I will elucidate on that point later.</P>
    <P>We know from carers and their representative bodies that there is acute and palpable disappointment at the failure of the Government to address the real issues, concerns and needs of those carers who perform tremendous work. We all laud the work and that is part of the problem. We may laud it, but it is the action that counts. We are supposed to be a cash rich society, which is illusory for the most part for the great bulk of people. There is a point blank refusal to give this group, which comprises the unsung heroes in society, the acknowledgement and, more importantly, the recognition it deserves. As my colleague, Deputy Broughan, already said, caring is a universal experience. We have all been cared for at some point and some of us will have to be cared for again. I trust that we will have some experience of caring at some stage.</P>
    <P>For people involved in the provision of care, it is a 24 hour, seven day a week job. Their tremendous work ensures that, rather than having to be placed in institutional care, which would happen if those people did not provide the care, the elderly relative, be it a mother, father, uncle, aunt, cousin or whatever, or the young relative is kept within the home environment where he or she is happiest. Recognition for this role should be enshrined in legislation and in the Constitution. Instead there has been an orgy of rhetorical flour<Col N="307" /> ishes in support of the concept of community care, but we have not matched the verbal commitment with the legislative or monetary input which carers deserve.</P>
    <P>I believe wholeheartedly in providing that input and it is a fundamental belief of mine. I would hold the same view were my party in Government. It is not a political point. I strongly and wholeheartedly believe in it because of the tradition from which I come. So strongly do I believe in it that, if I thought a 1% increase in my taxes would solve the problem for carers and give them the £150 million or £200 million, whatever the calculation may be, I would readily espouse that cause. Why should we get into this selfish view of society that it is only the &ldquo;me&rdquo; that counts rather than the &ldquo;we&rdquo;? We should widen it to ensure that people who are less well off and who provide a tremendous service for society by caring for others are rewarded. I hold that belief strongly and I am not happy with the rush towards greed. Taxation cuts to look after the &ldquo;me&rdquo; are the prevalent mood. We should ensure that money is raised for people who provide such a worthwhile service.</P>
    <P>It is high time a White Paper on caring and the role of carers in society was prepared so that the most appropriate constitutional and legislative basis for underpinning the role of carers can be formulated and put in place. One of the problems the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, has probably met is the lack of information on carers and a dispute as to the number of carers. Both I and Deputy McGrath have encountered this dispute as to the number of carers. The information is scant and all over the place, and there is an obvious need for an adequate database of detailed information on carers. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs does not have an up to date database on the number of carers and a breakdown of the people involved in providing care. About five or six years ago it was clear that about 70% of those providing care were women. We do not know how that statistic has changed in the interim, if at all, and the information is scant. That would be a very important point from which to begin.</P>
    <P>A recent study by the Western Health Board revealed that there were more than 20,000 carers in its area. If that is extrapolated to the country as a whole, the Carers Association's view and its definition of a carer would surely be vindicated. It says that there are more than 120,000 carers. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs says there are between 50,000 and 60,000 carers. Deputy McGrath is the Fine Gael spokesperson in this area and he would be more <i>au fait</i> with the exact figures in that regard. The review of the carer's allowance published in 1998 estimated that about 50,000 people were involved in the provision of full time care, incorporating care of elderly people and adults and children with disabilities. The Carers Association, which <Col N="308" /> has done great work under its general secretary, Eddie Collins-Hughes, recently estimated that there were about 120,000 family carers.</P>
    <P>Whatever the figure may be, the travesty is that, as of one month ago, only 16,000 people were in receipt of the carer's allowance, despite the relaxation in the disregard and the increases and whatever. We all appreciate that it is a 24 hour, seven day a week job, which is why there is a critical need for respite care and other resources. However, if 16,000 are in receipt of the allowance, that is less than 15% qualifying, and they are put through the wringer to qualify. They jump through many hoops and negotiate many obstacles and impediments to receive it. When they receive the allowance, it is like the marathon runner hitting the wall, in that they receive a pittance. It is about 50p an hour, one tenth of the national minimum wage. It is scandalous. We stand indicted as a society in asking anyone to do the valuable work carers do while at the same time paying unlimited lip service to them and making rhetorical flourishes that would make some of the great orators who have adorned this Chamber return and wonder what is happening. Despite this, we engage in it.</P>
    <P>We are penny pinching and saving and that is what riles me. As I said, if that shortage of money exists, I am prepared to say that I do not mind if my tax rate is increased from 42% to 43% to cover it. If that is what it takes, that is what I am prepared to pay. I believe in something like that. If we are ever returned to Government and I am part of it, this will be a fundamental point for me. I will not go through the lobbies unless something is done. That is a strong commitment but that is the way I feel about it. It is not the money but the principle which we should acknowledge as a society. I know men who resigned from their jobs at 60 years of age to care for their elderly mothers, and Deputy McGrath and I have a friend who did that. These people never sought nor received a penny.</P>
    <P>The means test is a critical issue for carers and for the carer's allowance. The eligibility criteria must be smashed. Even if this is started on a phased basis and even if it costs £200 million, let us dismantle them. If there are 100,000 carers, it would cost about £320 million at current payment levels. If there are 50,000 carers, it would cost about £160 million. We have to get the figures right. That is the reason it is important to establish a database. As I have no doubt Deputy McGrath will say, the carer's allowance is derisory. This is an issue about which I feel strongly.</P>
    <P>One can add insult to injury. One in eight gets through the loop and receives 50p or 60p an hour, but lo and behold who is waiting at the far end but the Revenue official? Have we gone mad? It seems we are grappling to collect every shilling. I know of people who are of the view that they have been let down by the State. They were put through a triple loop before eventually being granted the allowance. We should cut out the nonsense and if it costs £320 million, so be it. <Col N="309" /> Some day we will be old, and I hope someone will be in a position to care for me if I want to remain in my own domestic environment where I am happiest.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an adequately funded respite care service. Most carers are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Let us be honest, the level of service is inadequate. A decent annual respite care grant should be provided and an adequate number of respite care places made available, both day care and long-term.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will appreciate, the lack of public transport presents a huge problem in rural areas in terms of accessibility. While it should be acknowledged that the Government has extended the free schemes to carers, giving free bus passes is of no use in rural areas where a public bus is a mirage. It is time, therefore, to change to a voucher system under which vouchers to the value of £300 or £400 would be available each year for use on public-private partnership services, private bus services, urban taxi services, now to be found in all our major towns and which service rural areas, as well as rural taxi services. That is the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath and I have taken a great interest in the Centres of Independent Living. There is such a centre in Kinnegad, to which Deputy McGrath will refer. Even though they provide a tremendous and worthwhile service, funding is provided on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis. The result is a lack of certainty. While those who operate the community employment programme through FÁS do their best, the centres in question are not sure what the next year or two will bring. It is also becoming more difficult to attract qualified applicants to participate in community employment schemes. Deputy McGrath and I have asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to try to place this service on a more solid funding base which, as everybody knows, is essential. There should be no uncertainty, it should be clear as crystal that the centres will be funded. I ask the Government to provide the necessary funding to enable the centres to employ the necessary supervisory and other staff to provide this essential service. Deputy McGrath is working at health board level to ensure this will happen in the case of the centre in Kinnegad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey is correct that the disabled person's grant has been increased, but there is a need to make a change to the scheme. If an applicant's general practitioner recommends that he or she is a qualifying applicant, this should be accepted by the local authority as proof of eligibility. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, the person concerned is examined in minute detail by his or her general practitioner before submitting the relevant form which, once they put their name to it, should be seen as authenticating the person's illness. This should be seen by the local authority as meeting the qualifying criteria. People have to wait far too long for payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>I concur with the comments made about section 8, subsection (2) of which states: &ldquo;An <Col N="310" /> employer may refuse, without reason, to permit an employee to take a period of carer's leave which is less than 13 weeks duration.&rdquo;  This is extraordinary. I presume the employee concerned would already have secured a decision from a deciding officer under the Social Welfare Act, 1993, granting him or her carer's benefit. Under subsection (2) an employee whose elderly parent or child only requires six or seven weeks' full-time care and attention may be prevented from taking leave and the employer will not have to give a reason. In practice, the provisions of section 8 will operate against employees who will have to avail of carer's leave to care for an extremely ill parent, spouse or child. Subsection (2) will place an obstacle in the way of employees who will have to try to meet urgent and serious caring needs. At the very least, the refusal of an employer to allow an employee to take a period of carer's leave which is less than 13 weeks' duration should be the basis for a referral by the employee of the matter to a rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>Given the reality of the lives of many carers who are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the provisions of section 8(3) which provide for a prohibition on a further period of carer's leave until a period of six weeks has elapsed are unduly restrictive. As my colleagues said, one does not get sick to order. All carers are familiar with the fact that those suffering from a serious illness have both good and bad days and are prone to sudden relapses. It is extremely important that the Minister of State agrees to amend the Bill to allow carers to take a further period of carer's leave in exceptional circumstances where a period of six weeks has not elapsed.</P>
    <P>While it is welcome that section 7 provides for a change in family circumstances &ndash; it often happens that two elderly parents need full-time care, either contemporaneously or in swift succession &ndash; it seems section 8(4) will negate the caring efforts of employees in such circumstances. It states that when an employee has completed a period of carer's leave in respect of one relevant person he or she will not be permitted to commence a further period of carer's leave in respect of another relevant person until a period of 12 months has elapsed since the termination of the first period of carer's leave. I have no doubt the Minister of State will give due consideration to the amendments we will bring forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the chairperson of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important Bill which provides for a new entitlement for employees to avail of temporary unpaid carer's leave to enable them to care for persons who require full-time care and attention. I endorse what the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said, that this is innovative social legislation, which should be acknowledged and welcomed as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The contributions of Members display their deep interest and concerns for those less fortunate in our society in terms of their health and well-being. Ireland has always been regarded as a caring society and it is right that, despite our new found wealth as a result of economic development, we should not forget about or allow to disappear from our culture one vital and important aspect of our lifestyle in which we can justifiably take pride, namely caring for each other.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had the benefit of a tremendous army of volunteers for a considerable time, who ensured that communities throughout the land continued to tick over. It did not matter to them whether they received paid or unpaid leave. The bottom line was that they were caring for people in their communities. I salute and pay tribute to all those over the years who have been involved in providing care. No Department or agency could provide the service and supports that have been provided in the past by volunteers and, in particular, by carers.</P>
    <P>There is pressure on the numbers of volunteers because of changing lifestyles and demands. I have witnessed this in my constituency of Dublin North Central where tremendous work is done by volunteers. For example, there is great pressure on those involved in the meals on wheels scheme, not just because of their lifestyles but because of the pressures which have led to legislation such as this. There is a double edged sword in this regard because when the House passes legislation on health, safety or welfare it may have an impact on volunteers in the community, such as those involved in the meals on wheels scheme.</P>
    <P>Heretofore it was possible to assemble a group of volunteers to prepare and cook in a local kitchen and deliver the meals in their cars. It is likely that will not continue because of legislation and other regulations that have been put in place. This will cause serious difficulties and problems. One cannot argue against the regulations because one expects certain standards in regard to the preparation, cooking and delivery of food. One cannot have one set of rules for one group and a different set for another.</P>
    <P>The House should recognise such difficulties are being created by legislation and funding should be allocated accordingly. The funding for meals on wheels amounts to £1.10 per plate. That is extremely good value and I am embarrassed on occasions when the figure is mentioned. However, if circumstances change everybody will agree that it will not be possible to provide a good, hot, solid meal to any group at that rate. It would cost a minimum of three to four times that figure. The general managers in the new system introduced by the Eastern Regional Health Authority will need to adjust their budgets accordingly. A tremendous group of volunteers participate in the meals on wheels scheme and they should be recognised and congratulated.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to be invited recently to a function to acknowledge the role of the Killester <Col N="312" /> social services committee which was paying tribute to a group of women who have provided meals to residents in a local authority complex and additional meals for the local meals on wheels service for many years. The woman with the longest record had worked for 32 years as a volunteer preparing, cooking and delivering meals three or four days per week. She never sought recognition for her voluntary contribution. She had a tremendous record and two other women had 30 and 31 years of voluntary service. However, their service reflects their age profile and we are running into problems regarding the cycle of volunteers. There are different demands and pressures today and the same numbers of volunteers are not coming through, which is unfortunate. I hope we will be able to tackle these issues, which are relevant to the Departments of Health and Children and Finance.</P>
    <P>This is innovative legislation, which has not resulted from an EU directive, and I acknowledge the role the Minister of State and his officials have played in this regard. Ireland is setting an example to other member states in regard to legislation in this area. The legislation is probably not going as far down the road as all of us would like but it is a strong starting position and as years go by I have no doubt it will be amended and developed to meet the needs of the time. I will not make any major recommendations for change but I have no doubt the Minister of State will take on board the contributions of Members and amendments will be made on Committee Stage which will improve the legislation.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we all recognise that there are issues, particularly in relation to nursing homes. That issue was before other authorities recently and some recommendations were made but all of us are aware of the escalating costs of this type of care. The cost of a stay in a nursing home can range from £400 to £800 per week for people who require specialised care such as those who suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Whether it is the £400 to £500 or the £700 to £800 per week care, it can be a costly process and a huge strain on families.</P>
    <P>The cost can vary depending on one's circumstances. One might be fortunate enough not to have the family home taken into consideration. Where it is taken into consideration there can be a huge variance according to the differences between families and whether it is the siblings of those requiring care or an individual or a couple. There is tremendous strain on family incomes particularly if prolonged care is required. Often families will pool their resources to cover the costs and in other instances other factors might come into play such as revenue from the family home.</P>
    <P>Recognising this and having regard to the longer life expectancy of people, I am pleased the Government announced in the budget its intention to introduce from October 2000 a carer's benefit scheme. The benefit allows people to care for persons who are so ill as to require full-time <Col N="313" /> care and attention. It came into effect last October in recognition of the valuable and important role of carers in society. It also acknowledges the fact that the vast majority of people would prefer to stay at home for as long as possible rather than enter long stay institutionalised or private nursing home care. This type of temporary unpaid carer's leave might also help people get over a particular hurdle when care is required and avoid a process that is hard to reverse, that is, entering institutionalised long stay care.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme and Carer's Leave Bill combined with the increases provided in the recent budget are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to improving the general environment for people who wish to care for an elderly parent, relative or friend in what are usually their final days. During that time they wish to remain in the privacy of their own homes and surroundings. This can be beneficial for both the carer and the person receiving the care.</P>
    <P>It is important that we give recognition to carers. Often the carer might be a friend of the person requiring care. It can be a difficult process not alone for the immediate family but also for the carer when the person is sick for a considerable time and eventually dies. The family might be able to get on with life but it can be difficult for the carer, who has been wrapped up in caring. That is extremely demanding and might involve working 24 hour days, seven days a week. When the sudden end comes we should look not just at that line but beyond it for a period. It should be recognised that the carer might be going through greater trauma than anybody else, regardless of who the cared for person is. We should put down a marker in this regard now and, at some stage in the future, look at little further beyond that line.</P>
    <P>The introduction of carer's benefit and carer's leave, combined with the increasing number of people working part-time, will change dramatically how we look after future generations of elderly people requiring full-time care and attention. Apart from the clearly recognised benefits, there will be financial benefits for the parties involved and for the State. However, that should not be the focus of our discussions.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the provisions of the Bill in detail and I do not intend to go through them again. They appear to be practical given the Government's decision that the carer's leave and carer's benefit schemes should be harmonised as much as possible. I compliment the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on working in harmony with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure the harmonisation of the two schemes. This is an example of good government and co-operation between Departments.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to move with haste to ensure the early passage of this Bill. The Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am chairman, will be happy to accommodate Committee Stage of the Bill as soon as is practicable. <Col N="314" /> It would be my intention and that of the committee to facilitate its swift passage. I will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out some of the issues which may not necessarily be included in this legislation but which warrant consideration in the broader context of the tremendous work being carried out by the carers in our community and the benefits that accrue from it. All we need do is take other innovative and practical measures, similar to those contained in this Bill, in other areas. They need not just involve one Department but, as we have seen with this legislation, two or more Departments could work in harmony to achieve tremendous benefit for the participants, the people receiving the benefit, the community at large and the State.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, his officials and the Government on this innovative legislation. There is general support in the House for the Bill so let us move forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will receive support from across the House, as previous speakers have said. Amendments will be put down on Committee Stage and I am sure that Deputy Callely, the chairman of the select committee, will facilitate plenty of discussion. Hopefully, the necessary amendments can be made.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the difficulties involved in having to give six weeks notice prior to taking carer's leave. While it is understandable that the employer will want as much notice as possible, there has to be recognition that from the carer's and cared for person's point of view a person cannot get sick on demand. There has to be flexibility in that regard. There also has to be flexibility in relation to the duration; perhaps it can be loosened somewhat.</P>
      <P>Generally, this is a good and welcome innovation and, as others have pointed out, it is unique in Europe. However, we must focus on the demographic trends in Ireland. We must heed emerging demographic trends and ascertain whether we are planning properly for the future of elderly people. Perhaps a Government subcommittee should be established to draw up plans for the future. In 1995, some 400,000 people living in Ireland were over 65 years of age. An informed projection to the year 2020 predicts that the figure will be in the region of 700,000. That is a dramatic increase. We must take account of such projections and the services which will be required to cater for the increased number of people over 65, of whom I hope to be one.</P>
      <P>Nursing homes have mushroomed throughout the country because commercial interests have recognised that the number of elderly people will increase dramatically. Yet, the public sector is reducing the number of beds in old people's homes which are funded by the health boards. I object strongly to that. While I welcome the additional nursing homes, we must closely guard the numbers in the public sector and, where possible, increase them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe sufficient inspections are car<Col N="315" /> ried out on nursing homes to ensure they meet the requirements of the nursing homes regulations. Regular checks should be carried out in these homes. Elderly people are often vulnerable and unaware of their entitlements. Issues such as heating, which may appear insignificant to us, can be very important to elderly people who may be bedridden or have limited mobility. Inadequate heating systems could have dire consequences for their well-being. The regulations provide for controls in this area but I wonder whether their implementation is scrutinised. Frequent on-the-spot checks should occur. If advance warning was provided, I have no doubt that heating systems etc., would be working at their optimum level.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of reading the Ombudsman's report on the contentious issue of nursing home subventions and its contents are quite frightening. Our legislation states that all citizens are entitled to free hospital beds and in-patient care. What will happen if there is no room for elderly people in nursing homes or the local county home? Where will we put them? We must focus on the future provision of services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Penrose, I commend the Carers' Association for its tremendous work in co-ordinating services and providing back-up facilities. The Mullingar Carers' Association has a local office which serves as a focal point for information provision, meetings and general support services. The Carers' Association estimates that there are between 100,000 and 130,000 carers in Ireland yet the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs only puts the figure in the region of 50,000. It is obvious that there are at least 50,000 carers although the number is probably higher. Of the 50,000 carers recognised by the Department, only 16,000 receive any form of financial recognition for their work. Some of those 16,000 people do not even receive the full carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Many people do not qualify for the carer's allowance because of the operation of a means test. I recognise that for the first time in five years, the income disregard was increased in the recent budget to £250. Why have a means test at all? Carers do a very important job in caring for people in their own homes or in the homes of the people being cared for and save the State millions of pounds. If an elderly person is institutionalised, either in a public hospital or old people's home, the minimum cost is in the region of £500 per week. Nursing home subventions are even more costly and there should be a complete overhaul of this system in view of my earlier comments about people's entitlement to free hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The argument made in favour of the means test is that people who are well off do not need the carer's allowance. However, many middle income earners &ndash; essentially anyone whose income exceeds £350 per week &ndash; do not qualify for the carer's allowance. That is not fair. Why not remove the means test altogether as happened in <Col N="316" /> regard to higher education fees? The children of very wealthy people do not have to pay college fees. The means test for medical cards for people over 70 years is to be abolished and, while I welcome that, we should recognise the tremendous work carers are doing and abolish the means test.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance stands at approximately £88 per week. For that amount, people are expected to care for people 168 hours per week. Essentially, carers are being paid 50p an hour. I welcome the increase in the respite grant from £300 to £400 but Fine Gael suggests that all carers should qualify for the respite grant, irrespective of whether they receive the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>This point was made by Deputy Penrose earlier. There are so many caring people and if they could be given the respite grant, if not the full payment, it would be a help. If they meet the medical assessment of the person in need of care, they should qualify for the respite grant.</P>
    <P>What will one get for the respite grant, at £400? If one wanted to take a break or a holiday, could care be got for someone for £400 a week? It would not. The Minister of State should make a decent payment of £1,000, once a year and let them have that as a minimum. It would be worthwhile to do that.</P>
    <P>The Carers' Association should be given greater powers, resources and help to co-ordinate services for carers and the wider sector of the community. Deputy Penrose mentioned it in relation to the disabled person's grant. In County Westmeath it can be months before an application for a disabled person's grant is processed. The major hold up is at health board level as they do not have doctors to assess it.</P>
    <P>The point made earlier about the GP being able to make that assessment should be carried through. It would speed up the process as GPs are in touch with their patients, know what they need, are in regular contact with them and know the urgency of the situation.</P>
    <P>In County Westmeath, a person who had a stroke and needed his home modified would be lucky to get approved for the disabled person's grant in six or eight months. Before then he cannot start looking for a contractor to do the work, which is totally unacceptable. It is not fair and we are not treating those people with care. Perhaps the Minister of State would consider beefing up the Carers' Association to enable them to take that under their remit and be a pressure group to get that seen to and done on time.</P>
    <P>The argument regarding free travel was well made. In rural areas having a free travel pass is a laugh for many people. Where would one go on free travel? Even if one could go, the buses are not wheelchair accessible and disabled people cannot get on them.</P>
    <P>They should be allowed to use the passes with local taxis and operators. There is a precedent for that as there is a special concession for people who live on islands. They can use their travel passes in other ways besides on special transport. They can be used for flights in and out of the <Col N="317" /> islands. The precedent exists and it should, perhaps, be brought along further.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation of the carer's allowance, the general principle adopted by this and previous Governments was that all social welfare payments are taxable. On the face of it one might agree. The carer's allowance is an allowance for work done. Someone is being looked after by a person, therefore it is work done. Why not give that person the basic PAYE allowance which would mean they are registered as doing a job? In that way they would be given an allowance towards that payment which would probably mean it is not taxable.</P>
    <P>It is all right if that person is single and using the allowances in their own way. If, however, the person is married, has been means tested and qualified for the allowance, then the husband will be penalised in his tax. It would be a small gesture, if the good work they were doing was recognised and they were given that PAYE allowance. It can be justified on the basis that they are being paid for work, albeit that the pay is small and not of great advantage.</P>
    <P>I was shocked by Deputy Callely's assertion that the meals on wheels service is currently under threat. That is the first I heard of it. It makes sense in that, as regulations change, kitchens and so on where these meals are prepared will have to be changed and brought up to standard. The question of transporting food in cars must also be examined. The kitchens of which I am aware are certainly up to standard. The new one built in Mullingar, which will open shortly, is state of the art.</P>
    <P>I recognise that we must have a good service and reach hygiene standards and so on but could the Minister of State bring it to the attention of his colleagues to ensure that the meals on wheels service continues? It is a lifeline to many people. Not only does it give them a wholesome, hot meal once a day, ensuring they have something to eat, it can also be a vital point of contact.</P>
    <P>Very often the only point of contact some elderly people living alone have is when the person comes with the meals on wheels. Relationships and friendships are established. It is something we need to continue. If the Minister of State is going to change that, if the service ceases or people would have to travel for the service it would be frightening.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address that as a matter of urgency and bring it to the attention of his colleagues to examine how we can get around it? We are good at getting around things in Ireland. Let us not get to the situation where an announcement is made that &ldquo;all meals on wheels are now closed unless. . . &rdquo; and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to pre-empt that position and ensure there is a smooth transition to a new acceptable system. That valuable service must be kept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity to contribute to it. Having taken the <Col N="318" /> lifetime of the Government to introduce it, and despite the oft-quoted concern shown by the Government with regard to this section of the community, we should have done better by its production in this instance.</P>
      <P>There are many shortcomings in the Bill in so far as there is no recognition in it of the many young people who provide care. Research by University College, Dublin, a year and a half ago clearly indicates that, within a stone's throw of this building young people under 18 years of age, many as young as ten, provide care for a relative or a family member.</P>
      <P>It is sad that those people have not been recognised under the provisions of this Bill. They will always have to be there as, unfortunately, many people need care and assistance, maybe not full-time care on an ongoing basis due to serious illness or disability, but, for instance, for half an hour in the morning or an hour in the evening. They have been overlooked and that is regrettable. We are missing an opportunity to recognise that some family members are providing continuous lifetime care.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he will take as a consequence of his decision to make mandatory the wearing of safety jackets at sea; the training proposals he has to encourage seafarers to wear such equipment; the body or organisation which will bear the cost of the new scheme; and the compliance procedures he will introduce to police the scheme.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3485/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced on 28 January last that I intended to put in place new statutory measures which would require fishermen to wear suitable personal flotation devices.</P>
      <P>The present position is that while it is a statutory requirement to carry a sufficient number of lifejackets on board a vessel, the actual wearing of them while on deck is not. My initiative in this regard has been prompted by a number of recent incidents involving deaths of fishermen and others in recent times, where such tragic outcomes could have been avoided if PFDs, or lifejackets, had been worn.</P>
      <P>Before making this decision, which is a decision in principle, consultation took place with the Marine Survey office, the Coast Guard and other State agencies including BIM and the Health and Safety Authority who fully endorsed the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task now is to translate this decision in <Col N="319" /> principle into a workable scheme. This involves defining the quality standards to be specified for the equipment to be worn, definition of where the onus is to be placed for ensuring compliance with the regulation, and the preparation of the necessary statutory instruments. This process will involve detailed consultation with the statutory agencies and the fishing industry, and it has now commenced.</P>
    <P>Among the issues to be considered will be the costs and financing of the personal safety devices. In this regard, the primary responsibility for the safety of the crew of a fishing vessel lies with the owner of that vessel and meeting the costs of safety are properly part of the normal operating and commercial costs of running a fishing business. I do not see that the costs involved in meeting the requirement of the new regime should place any significant additional burden on the fishing sector. Nevertheless, we will consider if there is a case to give an incentive and encourage the start up of the new scheme. There are already a range of safety grants in place and it is likely that the new requirements can be accommodated within that framework.</P>
    <P>As regards training, I am advised that there are no major training requirements associated with the wearing of such personal safety devices. However, this issue will be looked at as part of the separate but related initiative on mandatory safety training which I also announced on 28 January last.</P>
    <P>As regards timetables, the aim is to have the consultation and analysis phase completed by April next. At that point I will take a decision on the basis of the advice then available on the timing of the introduction of the mandatory requirement. A lead in period will be required to enable the fishermen to adapt to the new situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, in principle I welcome this move because there have been a large number of tragic accidents at sea. Laudable and all as this measure is, and one would hope that the fishing industry would take this up because it would be in their own interest, once this is legislated for, what will the position be in regard to compliance? What about ships in the middle of the ocean? How will the necessary compliance be supervised? Many people in the industry tell me it is one thing to enshrine in legislation the need to wear mandatory safety equipment but unless the Minister, as the head of the Department, can convince the people to comply with this measure, there is not much more he can do unless some pressure can be put on in other ways. The worst thing that can happen is that we legislate for something without the necessary wherewithal to see it through. That is the biggest problem. I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point being made by the Deputy but we have to at least try to have this <Col N="320" /> measure accepted, thereby avoid many drownings as a result of fishermen being swept overboard. I would prefer to rely on persuasion and voluntary compliance but that has not worked up to now. While we are under no illusions as to the difficulties with enforcing this mandatory rule, we hope making it mandatory will result in fishermen being fully aware of the need to wear these devices, which are new and lightweight. The fishermen who want the wearing of this device made mandatory tell me there is no reason people should not use them, especially in difficult conditions, because they will not hinder their working ability once they get used to them.</P>
      <P>The message to all fishermen is that there have been a number of deaths because of fishermen being lost overboard in recent years. There was a particularly sad drowning recently in Cork where, tragically, a fisherman who was almost saved was lost. Had he been wearing a device, there is no question that his chances would have been enormously better. That is the only message we as legislators can give to fishermen. We should not have to make the wearing of this device mandatory but it is crucial for safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, it is obviously a carrot and stick approach. I have no problem with that but I put it to the Minister that there should be some sort of financial incentive for the fishing industry to get involved in this area because irrespective of the size of such an incentive, it seems to have a great effect, whether in fishing, farming or whatever. Perhaps the Minister should do that in parallel with the legislation to remove some of the cost and also to get across the importance of safety, which is in everybody's interest. Will the Minister give us an undertaking in that regard today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a major mistake to attach this programme to a financial incentive. We are making financial incentives available to fishermen to undertake safety training programmes and essentially the safety of a crew is the responsibility of the skipper and the owner of the boat. That is a commercial part of the fishing exercise. I would not envisage making grant aid available for this safety equipment. However, there are general grant aid schemes available towards the provision of improved safety measures on fishing boats and those are being taken up by the industry. We encourage the industry to upgrade their safety requirements and in a general way provide financial support for the improvement of safety equipment in general.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken together, the outcome of the EU-Norway negotiations and the Fisheries Council on quotas for 2001 was satisfactory from our viewpoint and should enable the industry to operate without significant financial loss this year.</P>
      <P>Total fishing opportunities across all sectors of the fishing industry have decreased marginally. Quotas for pelagic species such as mackerel, blue whiting and herring have increased by some 4,500 tonnes over last year. The aggregate quotas for traditional whitefish species are approximately 6,000 tonnes less than levels in 2000. However, a new significant quota of over 3000 tonnes for albacore tuna was also secured at Council. This overall outcome should cushion any financial loss for the fishing industry, particularly given the pricing indicators for this year. The global 16% cuts in traditional whitefish quotas are considerably more moderate than the opening Commission proposal for an unprecedented reduction of 36% which would have reduced the value of Irish landings by some £40 million.</P>
      <P>It is the case that a number of key whitefish stocks are in crisis. The scientific advice cannot be ignored. However, the Commission's drastic reductions in quotas for a number of species were moderated and linked to the introduction of targeted hake and cod recovery plans. These recovery plans are designed to conserve and rebuild these stocks and the detailed plans are now under negotiation in full consultation with fishermen. Measures under discussion include increased mesh sizes, better selectivity and closed areas. I am pleased that the Council backed my view that a range of responsible conservation measures is essential as opposed to the one dimensional approach of cutting quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general year-on-year variations in TACs and quotas are an integral part of the management of fish stocks under the Common Fisheries Policy. The TAC and quota system together with EU conservation and control regulations are designed to ensure that catch levels are in balance with the state of stocks. Financial compensation has never been paid in relation to annual fluctuations of TACs and quotas. Onshore control and monitoring of quota and all other conservation measures is carried out by the sea fishery officers of my Department. Seagoing enforcement is car<Col N="322" /> ried out by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. I have made it clear to the Commission and EU colleagues that enforcement must be applied consistently and across the board throughout the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to learn that the Commissioner accepted our case. Since I tabled the question, news reports indicate that the new regulations have been well received within the industry. What plans does the Department have in regard to deep water stocks and how will it encourage fishermen to fish these species? Will the Minister outline the outcome of the meeting with his opposite number, Swedish Minister, Margareta Winberg, given that Sweden will shortly take over the EU Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments on the outcome of the negotiations. Even though the worst effects of the original cuts were avoided, fishermen, particularly those in the white fish sector, will have a difficult year. My discussion with the incoming Swedish Presidency of the Council ranged over a number of initiatives which it wishes to take this year. It is putting major emphasis on fishing and the environment and is particularly interested in pursuing conservation policies which very much link with the type of initiatives we are taking. At the meeting in Dublin some weeks ago we outlined to the Swedish Minister our proposals on the closing of spawning areas, the increase in mesh sizes and a new approach in EU policy to conservation as opposed to TACs and quotas. This meets the objectives of the Swedish Presidency.</P>
      <P>We also pointed out the fundamental economic and socio-economic questions for small fishing communities who depend on the industry for their livelihood and the need for these to always be balanced against the demands of some interests on environmental issues.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether fishermen will incur substantial financial losses as a result of the Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels on 14 December 2000, when the total allowable catches for cod and whiting in the North Sea and in the west of Scotland as well as the northern hake stocks were drastically reduced for 2001; and if he proposes to compensate fishermen for the resultant loss of income.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fish quotas for 2001 negotiated at the December Council of Fisheries Ministers will not lead to significant financial losses for the fishing industry taken overall. The total fishing opportunities are slightly reduced across all sectors of the fishing industry. Quotas for pelagic species have increased by 4,500 tonnes over last year, while whitefish quotas are down by approximately 6,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission proposed cuts in whitefish quotas ranging from 50% for whiting to more than 60% for cod and haddock and 75% for <Col N="323" /> hake. The scientific advice pointed to the need for action but did not justify such large scale cuts across the board. I successfully argued for a phased approach to reducing fishing mortality, as opposed to drastic once off cuts. We achieved the necessary balance between the conservation imperative and maintaining realistic opportunities for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that many key whitefish stocks are in crisis and the phased approach to catch reductions has been linked to the implementation of targeted recovery programmes to conserve and rebuild cod and hake stocks. Compensation for annual fluctuations in TACs and quotas is not on the cards. I again emphasise that the reductions in volume for certain whitefish species are likely to be offset by overall opportunities and increased value. Quality control is a critical development challenge in a scenario of tight supply. The key objective for the industry, therefore, is to enhance efficiency and maximise quality and value. The necessary supporting measures will be available to assist the industry to adapt and modernise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the progress made on the conservation issues. People I met have said that all the fishing interests believe this is a step in the right direction. However, I have been told &ndash; now that the Minister has given the figures I can visualise this &ndash; that the fishermen who made most of their living from cod, whiting and hake will have a particularly bad year. I accept the points made by the Minister about stocks, but if the overall take on an already extremely low level is reduced by 16% obviously many of these fishermen will be put out of business. The Minister said there were other types of fishing, for example, tuna fishing. However, this is limited and some fishermen will not be able to do it.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I want to ask a legitimate question. Will the Minister outline, in so far as anyone can determine this, how he believes fish prices will go for the rest of the year? Obviously the value of the fish has much to do with this. Some of the people in the fishing industry with whom I have spoken are extremely worried about this aspect. They believe they are carrying the can unduly in the sense that they do not genuinely believe other fleets will be subjected to the same scrutiny as their fleet. This brings us back to the old story of how the industry is overseen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question that the cuts in quotas will have a negative effect on all fishermen in the white fish sector. However, I think there is a realisation among fishermen that there are not many options. If the stocks continued to be fished in a quick space of time there would be no stocks of hake and cod, which have become most precarious. There is no doubt that the conservation measures which have been agreed for <Col N="324" /> the first time will bring pain. If we reach agreement on closing spawning areas for key periods during the summer this will put additional pressures on fishermen. There is an acceptance in the industry around the coast, particularly in the south east which is our most significant white fish area, that it was the fishermen and their organisations who called for strong conservation measures to be implemented in the knowledge that if this was not done the stocks would deteriorate to a point where there would be no industry.</P>
      <P>We have tried to make up for some of the losses through a variety of schemes and to deal with a number of difficulties in the industry. We will continue to work closely with the industry to achieve the objective of ensuring a livelihood for fishermen which can sustain them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, following the Council meeting last December, that the protection system and surveillance will be stepped up on big fleets, those that almost put the fear of God in our hearts? Can the Minister give an undertaking that surveillance on the bigger fishing fleets, the fleets Irish fishermen are scared of, will be better than in the past? This must be fair and apply equally to all our European partners. If our fishermen are taking great pain, they should know that others are taking their fair share of the burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>

I am satisfied that is happening, although it is often charged that Irish fishermen are targeted more than others. Recently I again asked the Navy to ensure that does not happen.</P>

      <P>First, I extend my sympathy to all those who were bereaved as a result of accidents involving fishing vessels last year. Eighteen persons were lost or drowned from fishing vessels in Irish territorial waters in the year 2000. Of these, six were lost from Irish registered vessels while the remaining 12 were lost from a British registered fishing vessel which sank in waters off the west coast of Ireland. A further two persons were lost from Irish registered fishing vessels outside our territorial waters. While no precise records are available for crew losses from foreign flagged fishing vessels operating outside the territorial <Col N="325" /> waters off the Irish coast, it is known that a further eight persons, one of whom was Irish, lost their lives in accidents involving such vessels in the year 2000. Under international maritime law, it is the responsibility of the flag state to carry out investigations into marine casualties involving their vessels.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring the highest safety standards are maintained in the industry. This can only be achieved by a three-pronged approach comprising statutory regulation and enforcement, promotion of safety awareness, and the highest quality marine emergency services.</P>
      <P>My Department's priority has been to implement the recommendations and objectives of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group (FVSRG) The Fishing Vessel Safety Implementation Group, established in 1999, concluded that considerable progress had been made in the areas of introducing new radio regulations, safety training, onshore marine radio communications, fleet modernisation and safety awareness. Regulations were also introduced to give effect to the Torremolinos Convention on fishing vessels over 24 metres and work is well advanced on draft regulations for smaller sizes of fishing boats which have been the subject of consultation with the industry. In addition £200,000 was spent last year to establish a network of offshore weather and research buoys which will do much to improve weather forecasting and safety at sea. A further £300,000 has been provided in my Department's vote this year. On 28 January 2001, I announced my intention to put in place new legislation which will see the introduction of mandatory safety training and mandatory wearing of suitable personal flotation devices for fishermen in Ireland.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>An ongoing campaign of safety awareness is undertaken in conjunction with a number of State agencies and other bodies such as the RNLI. A group, known as the Marine Safety Working Group, comprising members of all these interested agencies and bodies meets regularly to co-ordinate efforts in this regard and initiatives undertaken include the publication and national distribution of a number of booklets and posters in the &ldquo;Safety on the Water&rdquo; series. In addition the Implementation Group has agreed that arrangements should be made in conjunction with the Marine Safety Working Group for a publicity campaign to highlight safety issues in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Finally, the development of a comprehensive safety programme for the sea fishing sector involves ongoing consultation with the fishing industry, which has a vitally important part to play in developing a safety culture among fishermen. A formal liaison process, which is working very well, has been established between the implementation group and the industry.</P>

      <P>We are all concerned about the number of deaths last year, the highest on record. I note that on 28 January the Minister issued a statement in relation to trawler safety in which he indicated that he intended to introduce legislation to give statutory and mandatory effect to all safety aspects of the industry. When is it intended to introduce that legislation, and will it be done by way of legislation, regulation or amendment of an existing Act? Will it be mandatory for the industry to implement whatever measures the Minister introduces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are currently in consultation with the industry and with the various safety authorities. It is my intention to introduce that legislation as quickly as possible. It should be ready fairly quickly, but getting legislation into the Dáil is difficult. I cannot, therefore, be definitive as to when it is likely to be introduced in the Dáil. It is my intention to give statutory status to the regulations and to make them mandatory. That will apply to the wearing of life jackets and also, possibly, to the training of people coming into the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the necessary training programmes and facilities are available. BIM is doing very good work in training schools such as those in Greencastle and Castletownbere. However, I am concerned by the number of young people with no training who come into the industry and go out to sea. I would strongly urge skippers not to employ people who have no training. There is no question that their abilities are impaired in difficult conditions. On a personal note, since I have been in this job, I have had occasion to visit a number of widows whose husbands were lost at sea. As one who knew little about fishing before I came into this job, it was a most difficult experience. Most Irish people do not understand the very difficult life of fishermen who have lost so many of their loved ones at sea. It is a very difficult situation that the rest of us take for granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following discussions with the European Commission, I was pleased to announce in March last significant increases, averaging 30%, in the rates of annual forest premium for those planting from 1 October 1999. In the case of farmers planting broadleaves (oak and beech) in severely handicapped areas, for example, the annual premium increased from £265 to £373 per hectare. For farmers planting 20% diverse conifers, the premium increased from £210 to £308 per hectare. The new scheme included a three-yearly view, which the previous scheme lacked.</P>
      <P>The Commission was unwilling at that time to co-fund similar increases for those who planted in earlier years, on the basis that they had signed a contract.</P>
      <P>My Department made a further detailed submission to the Commission in April 2000 in support of such increases. I vigorously pursued this case at a number of meetings with the Commission both here and in Europe in the latter half of last year. Regrettably, the Commission remained steadfast in its refusal to co-fund the increases.</P>
      <P>Application of the 30% increase to pre-1999 planting would give a much needed boost in terms of confidence for the sector, in meeting the targets in our afforestation programme and in delivering on the forestry elements of the National Climate Change Strategy. For that reason I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer, at an estimated annual cost at present of £3.4 million, for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. In view of the State aids aspect, any decision to have the cost borne by the Exchequer would also require Commission agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for trying. The reason I put down the question was that another effort was being made to go back to the European Union. That has obviously failed. Is the Minister putting it on the record today that the Exchequer is willing to pick up the tab? In other words, is the Government making £3.4 million available to about 7,000 farmers who planted prior to the introduction of the higher level of funding, subject to the agreement of the European Commission? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. I am negotiating with the Department of Finance and the Deputy will know from experience how simple that is. However, I hope to have a decision from that Department within the next few days. I had to apply the same vigour to the Department of Finance as I applied in Europe. A decision has not been made but I do not intend to give up easily. A decision by the Department of Finance is imminent and I must then seek the agreement of the European Commission. Because of all the trips I made to Europe and the meetings I had <Col N="328" /> there, I am probably expected back, asking for permission to allow the Government to take up the extra £3.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government does not take this up it will have a huge knock-on negative effect on the number of farmers going into forestry. We all thought there would be a big number of people who would take up the higher payments but it has not worked out that way. Many farmers are of the opinion that if there were to be a change in the future they would be caught a second time. As far as the future of forestry is concerned the £3.4 million would be well spent by the Exchequer. I am disappointed the Minister is not in a position to say this will be done. It is obvious that a Government decision has not yet been made on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 23 November last year to similar questions raised in the House I outlined developments on two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas field and the Helvick oil field. The position regarding the Corrib gas field is that Enterprise Energy Ireland, acting as operator for the development of the Corrib Gas Field, declared it commercial on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited, and sought a lease from me for its development. This is being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland have plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expect the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
      <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department where it is analysed, using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. Deputies will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and, therefore, must remain confidential. However, Enterprise Energy Ireland is reported as saying that the Corrib Field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Helvick oil field, the position is that Providence Resources completed an appraisal well on the oil field in the Celtic Sea in September last year. The drilling and tests results have been reviewed in detail in recent months. Although the test results on the well confirmed the good reservoir and oil characteristics seen on the original Helvick oil discovery well in 1983, further detailed analysis has indicated that the Helvick reservoir is much smaller than had been hoped and is highly compartmentalised. Accordingly, Providence Resources has concluded that a stand alone development of Helvick cannot be justified. Following analysis of the data obtained in 2000 my technical advisers have indicated that Helvick is not commercial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Providence Resources has other interests in the Celtic Sea which include blocks 50/6 &amp; 7, 50/11 <Col N="330" /> and the Ardmore gas prospect. The company has indicated that it remains committed to realising value from its Celtic Sea assets but the fact that Helvick cannot be made commercial has resulted in Providence reviewing its plans for the Celtic Sea as a whole and conducting a strategic appraisal of a number of business development options. My Department is currently in discussion with Providence Resources about restructuring its authorisations in the East Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>As regards drilling, I expect to see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity this year with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. Unfortunately, however, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six wells for the entire Irish offshore and there is a possibility that many of the frontier exploration licences issued in previous licensing rounds will be relinquished this year. With this in mind I commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas.</P>
    <P>To that end, I have started a consultation process involving companies active here in order to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licenses might be offered. The question as to whether it would be appropriate to have a further licensing round will be considered in the light of this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 December as saying that the new round of licensing would hinge on a commitment from the firms. Has that round commenced? If so, what commitment has the Minister received? If it has not commenced, what commitments will he seek from the companies? The Minister issued a statement in January on the Corrib Field and referred to the requirement for a foreshore licence under the Foreshore Act and planning permission being required. At what stages are the application for the licence and the planning permission?</P>

I will be happy to inform the House when we progress the matter. As regards the drilling programme for this year, we have authorised the go ahead for drilling in the wells I have outlined.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the press release of 4 January, to which Deputy Bell referred, the company announced in January that this was a commercial find and that it would go ahead with the implementation of its programme to start the work of bringing the gas ashore.  </P>
      <P>Regarding the distribution of gas throughout the country, the company has entered into an agreement with Bord Gáis Éireann that a pipeline will be laid from Pollatomish to Craughwell which will link in with the ring main. It will be a matter for BGE to distribute the gas from that pipeline and BGE has indicated it is prepared immediately to service towns adjacent to the pipeline: Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and possibly Athenry. The allocation of gas to other towns in the west will be the subject of further consideration and will be examined by Government.</P>

Is this the first public announcement to that effect which has been made or has it already been described as non-commercial? The Minister said also that the Providence company, which was exploring the Helvick field, has exploratory rights to other areas in the Celtic Sea. Could the Minister have his Department inform me of the location of those areas by way of a map? Also, what is the time scale Providence had to carry out exploratory works in those areas? There is always a limit to the amount of time which can be used for research.</P>

Everybody had high hopes, particularly the company, that this would be successful and it is not.</P>
      <P>As to the other information, I will provide the Deputy with the details regarding the other areas the company has in the Celtic Sea.

Will the Minister explain why notification of deadlines for submissions or observations were not advertised in local or national newspapers? Is the deadline set for people to make observations or objections? Will the Minister guarantee that north Mayo residents will get the opportunity to submit observations to his Department about how this project affects them as they are doing with the county council regarding the planning application?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are statutory procedures pertaining to the application for foreshore licences, including public notices, just as there are with planning applications. Obviously we will adhere to those statutory procedures and we will give ample opportunity to the general public to become aware of any applications made and to comment on them. It is important to ensure that while the public in the area have a chance to look at what is being proposed and to make observations and to discuss objections with Mayo County Council in the first instance, it is equally important that people accept the great advantages that this project offers Mayo and that when the procedure is completed and people have been given answers we are not subject to unnecessary <Col N="333" /> delays in what is a very significant scheme in terms of the future economy of Mayo.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Minister agree it is time to reverse the shameful sell-out by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992, when the Corrib field was given to a major multi-national company, Enterprise Oil, with no royalties accruing to the Irish people? It was able to write off taxes against company costs going back to 1984, which meant that for years not a penny in taxation would be gathered. This gas might as well be coming from Timbuctoo for all the good it will do economically to benefit the Irish people. I understand the gas pipeline will be mostly provided by BGE. That kind of huckster's deal might be appropriate for something worked out in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races but it is an utter betrayal of the Irish people. Is it not pathetic that the State is dependent on information supplied to it by these multinationals to assess the extent of what is in the oil and gas fields? Does the Minister agree there should be an independent assessment by the State because it is in the interests of the multinationals to play down the extent of the find? Should we now have learned the lesson&mdash;</P>

The Minister is right that this is a wonderful find for the west, but I do not want the people of north Mayo stamped on by multinational companies, the Government, the local county council or anybody else. They have a right to make observations and lodge objections and they must be protected in the same way as foreigners and everyone else who comes into this country. Will the Minister give the local people every opportunity to lodge objections. In the case of all other gas finds here in the past, the gas has been <Col N="334" /> brought up at sea. Could that not be considered in this case, rather than a measure that will affect the lives of many people in north Mayo?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the individual concerned was employed as a fishery officer by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. Primary responsibility for his employment and retirement lies with the board.</P>
      <P>The House has been advised on previous occasions of the background to this case. The fisheries officer in question suffered appalling injuries in 1993 when assaulted during a seagoing salmon protection patrol. The circumstances in which he sustained his injuries where convictions followed reflected a state of serious and bitter opposition to commercial salmon fishing regulations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s in the southern region. As a result of these injuries and in line with successive medical reports, the individual was unable to return to work. He remained on sick leave and half pay until December 1999. His retirement on ill health grounds on 3 December 1999 followed an extensive process to arrive at an outcome and financial package, which would reflect the exceptional circumstances of this individual and the ordeal he suffered as an officer of the State. My Department worked throughout to deliver a fair outcome with the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board Commission, which between 1996 and 1999 had statutory responsibility for management and other functions of the board.</P>
      <P>A retirement package was negotiated with the Department of Finance for the individual concerned in accordance with the provisions of the fisheries board's staff superannuation scheme. The package included a pension lump sum and a special gratuity under the injury warrants scheme, which was negotiated as an exceptional measure. These were paid to the individual concerned on 16 December 1999.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the individual and his union subsequently took a case for unfair dismissal and minimum notice to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal found in favour of the fisheries board on 16 January last. An outstanding claim in relation to holiday pay and unsocial hours is being pursued at the Labour Relations Commission and will be concluded shortly.</P>
      <P>There is the utmost sympathy for the individual concerned in terms of the ordeal he suffered and every effort has been made throughout to assist him financially in recognition of the exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>Last month Enterprise Energy Ireland, acting as operator for the development of the Corrib Gas Field, declared it commercial on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited and sought a lease from me for its development. This is currently being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
      <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department, where it is analysed using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with the assessment is commercially sensitive and must, therefore, remain confidential.

      <P>Deputy Higgins is worried about what has happened at sea, but I am more worried about what happens on land when the <Col N="337" /> gas is brought ashore. What priority will Bord Gáis have in terms of the customers such gas supply will be aimed at and the general priority it will use to distribute this most important gas find?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bord Gáis has indicated it will service the towns adjacent to the pipeline and that it and the Government are spending £300 million on bringing the gas pipeline to the west indicates that it is the policy of the Government and Bord Gáis to supply gas throughout the country as quickly and efficiently as possible. One of the benefits to the west will be that towns of an adequate size will be able to receive natural gas. The major advantage to the west will be that, for the first time, there will be an energy source that can be used to generate electricity. This will create the possibility of attracting large scale industry which up to now the IDA has had to refuse, particularly in the pharmaceutical and heavy engineering areas and, most recently, the development of web farms.</P>
      <P>The gas itself will be of benefit, but its use as a power source for electricity generation will be a much bigger advantage for counties in the west such as Mayo, Galway and Sligo. This is where the main economic advantage for the region lies. We must ensure that unreasonable delays are avoided in respect of objections. As I said in response to Deputy Ring, we respect everybody's right to object and to make their point of view known. However, it would be sad for the west if long delays were caused by objections which did not ultimately stand up. All of us as Deputies from the west should try to ensure that responsibility is exercised on the part of people who make objections.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that the Corrib Group declared the field commercial on 9 January 2001. It has submitted an application for a petroleum lease and is at present finalising a plan of development &ndash; POD &ndash; for the gas field. As the Government Minister from the west with responsibility for offshore oil and gas developments, I am determined to ensure that the west receives its full share of benefits from the Corrib gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The configurations of distribution downstream gas pipelines will be a matter in the first instance for Bord Gáis Éireann &ndash; BGE &ndash; the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister of State in that Department. As the representative in Government for the western region, I have been pursuing vigorously with both Ministers and Bord Gáis the provision of gas supply options for the west. My priority is the extension of the gas net<Col N="338" /> work and a new supply off the west coast to accelerate economic development in the Border, midlands and western regions.</P>
    <P>I recently discussed with the chief executive officer of Bord Gáis the provision of a natural gas supply to towns adjacent to a proposed pipeline between Rossport, County Mayo, and Craughwell, County Galway, to link with the proposed pipeline spur from Dublin to Galway. The BGE response was positive and the company also said that it has plans for towns such as Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry to receive a natural gas supply. The Dublin-Galway ring main will also bring natural gas heating to homes in Galway city and Oranmore and facilitate gas powered electricity generation in Connacht.</P>
    <P>I will also pursue with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Public Enterprise the question of building a further pipeline from Pollatomish via Ballina to Sligo to service towns in north Connacht as a first phase to bring a gas supply to the whole north west region. Bord Gáis has indicated that this will require further Government investment. The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary pipeline infrastructure is in place to bring gas to domestic and commercial customers in the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas will go into the national grid and will have to compete with gas from other sources. Competition will be most important in that respect. While Bord Gáis is the semi-State body with responsibility for the distribution of gas, several companies sell gas through Bord Gáis pipelines. There is competition between a number of companies supplying gas through the current national gas pipeline infrastructure. It is the Government's view that there should be open and transparent competition so that the price of gas for consumers is at the lowest possible level.</P>

However, these terms are not much more attractive than those available to the companies throughout the world.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not be disingenuous. We have had unbelievably good luck in finding a well and we cannot now go back and try to change the terms on which the companies explored for gas.

      <P>The proposed new European maritime safety agency &ndash; EMSA &ndash; is part of the second package of measures put forward by the European Commission in the wake of the <i>Erica</i> pollution incident off the French coast in December 1999. The first package of measures was proposed by the Commission in March 2000 and since then agreement on various measures has been reached at the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>The first exchange of views at official level regarding the new agency since the proposal was published in December 2000 took place at a working group meeting in Brussels yesterday. The Commission sees the primary objective of the new agency as ensuring the proper implementation of existing legislation. The agency will aim to ensure efficient and uniform application of the international rules within the EU. It is expected that it will also act as a technical support body to the Community and to member states, providing them with a high level of expertise in this complex area.</P>
      <P>On the question of how the new agency will work with the Irish authorities, I understand that, according to the Commission, it is not proposed that the agency will interfere in any way with the legislative powers of national authorities. The Commission considers that the agency should play a major role in organising appropriate training activities on port and flag state-related issues. In this regard, the Commission suggests that harmonising the training of the member states' surveyors will help to ensure a uniform EU maritime safety system.</P>
      <P>I am advised that member states at yesterday's meeting were favourably disposed to the objective of the proposed agency. All member states, however, considered that the details of the proposal would need to be thoroughly examined before any conclusions could be reached.</P>

      <P>The first task for the commission was to provide advice to me on the implementation of salmon tagging. Allied to consulting the commission, I undertook a formal public consultation process. The commission recommended the introduction of the tagging scheme for all sectors, including recreational angling, on 1 January 2001.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that while there is support for the tagging scheme generally, the Federation of Irish Salmon and Sea Trout Anglers expressed concerns about the scheme. Their stated primary concern relates to the amount of information to be supplied in the logbook returns. They have also highlighted four other key concerns which are the potential for abusing recreational tags, the treatment of farmed salmon, the need for enhanced protection and the possibility of extensions to the commercial season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear to FISSTA that I want to see all players working constructively through the forum of the Salmon Commission on the major challenges facing the salmon resource, with conservation the first priority. As members of the commission, salmon anglers should play a full and vital part in its work to deliver on our wide ranging agenda. I have met FISSTA to discuss their concerns about the tagging scheme and I have written to them setting out my position on each of those concerns. In light of genuinely held con<Col N="342" /> cerns of anglers and others, and as a means of building confidence in the tagging scheme, I have now decided that the amount of information required to be supplied in the logbook returns will be reduced forthwith. The focus will return to actual fish caught as opposed to fishing effort, obviously in the context of full compliance with tagging. I have informed FISSTA and the commission accordingly and I am pleased to have the opportunity to put my decision on the record today. I have also asked the commission to continue to review the logbook requirements for 2002 in light of experience this year and in consultation with all interests, including angling clubs.</P>
    <P>I await a response from FISSTA and confirmation that it will co-operate with the tagging scheme and move forward, working within the commission, in the interests of the salmon resource.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister make his recent decisions available to members of the Opposition? What is the budget of the Salmon Commission and are there any plans to change it &ndash; that was the question?</P>
      <P>Is he now saying that the logbook will be changed in such a way that the recommendations of the Salmon Commission will be totally undermined and watered down? Could he give more details of what will not be recorded in the logbook? For instance, is he asking fishermen to state what fish are not caught in order that we can identify rivers which do not contain fish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the commission has been given an allocation of £70,000 to cover its operational costs and I will forward the names of members of the commission &ndash; I neglected to state that in my reply.</P>
      <P>Second, I have decided that where some fishermen have a conscientious objection to filling in all the information required in the logbook, it will be satisfactory for them to simply record their catch and the tagging of the salmon. Some anglers who are members of FISSTA objected to the level of intrusion in what they consider their personal details. Where such people have a conscientious objection, we will be satisfied this year to accept their record of the fish tagged.</P>
      <P>We hope that other anglers would give us the additional information requested in the logbook. It is not intended to change the logbook for this year but rather to make that gesture to people who have a genuine and sincere concern. The commission will review the logbooks in consultation with the anglers and, indeed, FISSTA in order that the logbook will be more effective next year.</P>

      <P>If ever I heard an about-turn on legislation enacted only two months ago, I am listening to one now from the Minister. I recall raising the type of consultation the Minister had with FISSTA and others several times on Committee Stage and Report Stage, and he indicated that as far as he was concerned it appeared that there was broad agreement with what he was going to do. It now appears that this is far from the case and that there is open opposition to it, up and down the country. Given that the consultation process must not have worked as well as he indicated to the House, where will all this finish?</P>

I feel confident that the scheme will go ahead, that the other four issues will be dealt with by the commission, and that we will reach agreement with everybody and proceed <Col N="344" /> with what is a most important scheme for the future of wild salmon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Chief Whip and the other Whips for allowing this debate. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this report on science and technology. This is one of seven reports completed by the Joint Committee on Education and Science since the committees were formed in November 1997. I congratulate Deputies Richard Bruton and Naughten who were the rapporteurs on this project which was to investigate the current state of learning in science and related subjects at primary, secondary, third and fourth levels and its <Col N="345" /> adequacy to meet the demands on Ireland to compete in the knowledge-based society.</P>
      <P>The 1971 primary school curriculum gave little attention to elementary science in the social and environmental studies syllabus it introduced. As a teacher at the time, I remember the expectation was that there would be more emphasis on science. The new curriculum for science at primary level, published in September 1999, places much greater emphasis on elementary science. The effective implementation of the science element of the revised curriculum requires that we enable primary school teachers to embrace science positively as a new and vibrant subject.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999, preparations for the introduction of science as part of social, environmental and scientific education in the revised primary school curriculum have been under way. During the 1999-2000 school year, a number of supports were provided for schools. For example, the science curriculum and teacher guidelines were disseminated to all primary teachers, a total of £1.7 million in the form of grants was made available to schools for the purchase of science equipment &ndash; this is very welcome but it should be increased &ndash; a school development planning initiative was launched to assist schools in curriculum planning and a comprehensive programme of courses for teachers in primary science was run during the summer of 2000.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, as part of the work of the primary school curriculum support programme, a developmental project in science has already been initiated in a representative sample of schools. This work will facilitate teachers in exploring the approaches and methodologies and the range of materials necessary for teaching science. As is the case with all subjects in the revised primary school curriculum, schools may commence implementation of science in advance of the formal support programme if they wish.</P>
      <P>In secondary schools, about 90% of students do science up to the junior certificate. At the age of 14, Irish pupils rank in the top half of the OECD league in science in contrast with students aged nine to ten in the primary sector who score in the bottom half of the OECD league in science. It shows how quickly Irish pupils improve their standing in science once they enter second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the Department of Education and Science is implementing a range of measures designed to make the physical science subjects more attractive to students at second level. Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and chemistry were introduced in September 2000 with an increased emphasis on student practical work. These changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science has been introduced. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry, the structure and layout of ques<Col N="346" /> tions on the ordinary level papers have been revised. These changes have been designed to make these examination paper more accessible for the candidates for whom they are intended. Example materials illustrating the changes were distributed at the end of last year.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of chemistry and physics commenced in September 1999 and is designed to operate for three years. Comprehensive reference handbooks in both chemistry and physics in both printed and CD-ROM formats have been distributed to all second level schools. The report states that too few physics or chemistry graduates go into teaching. The preponderance of teachers who have trained in biology no doubt contributes to the dominance of this branch of science.</P>
    <P>While the number of full-time third level students pursuing science in the broadest sense, including life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, statistics and information technology courses, has increased over the past decade to some 20,000 in the 1998-99 academic year, there is evidence of a decline in the numbers taking the physical sciences. A range of initiatives are now in place to enhance the perception of the physical sciences, including the science, technology and innovation awareness programme, which is managed by Forfás, the skills review group under the aegis of the Irish Pharmaceutical and Chemical Manufacturers' Federation and on which the Department of Education and Science is represented, a physics website to counter the negative image physics has among schoolchildren is being run by the department of physics at Trinity College Dublin, and a number of institutes of technology have also instituted a number of schemes at local level to encourage students to pursue third level science related courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, recently announced the setting up of a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level. Its brief is to identify the issues contributing to the decline in the uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The work of the task force will range across both second and third levels and will also interact with industry, thus providing insights for students into the many courses and careers available to them as a result of a study of the physical sciences.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also recently established an Irish council for science, engineering and technology. This new council will establish schemes of support for researchers in science, engineering and technology, including new and improved grant schemes for postgraduate scholars and post-doctoral fellows as well as providing funding for research programmes. It will complement the existing council for humanities and social services and other structures already in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I welcome this debate and I hope we return to discuss these issues. In our work programme for 2001 we have included a paragraph which states:</P>
    <P>[To] review, on a six monthly basis, matters relevant to reports on specific topics which have been published by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>We will press the Department to respond on a six monthly basis. I join the rapporteurs in their recommendation that the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come together to drive forward the necessary initiatives to strengthen science education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We received many interesting comments on the report compiled by Deputies Richard Bruton and Naughten. One of the letters we received was from Dr. Peter Childs who chaired the working group on science education at the University of Limerick. He said:</P>
    <P>I have read with great interest the Report on Science and Technology produced by your Committee. I think it is an excellent and comprehensive report and long overdue look[ing] at a neglected area in Irish education.</P>
    <P>At the University of Limerick we have been involved in science education and the training of science teachers for nearly 30 years and are currently the largest single provider of science teachers, all of whom can teach either chemistry or physics, in addition to LC biology. This year nearly 150 students are in training, spread over four years in three degree programmes, and their entry qualifications are high, as is their reputation in schools. We have also been involved in in-service education, providing resources and support for science teachers e.g. Chemistry in Action! magazine (started 1980) and the Schools Information Centre for the Irish Chemical Industry (started 1989).</P>
    <P>The university also has excellent contacts with industry through its cooperative education programme, and we also run Industry Study Tours for teachers and are involved with industry in a number of science education projects. The most significant of these is the innovative Lucent Science Teacher Initiative, which started in November 2000 and is funded by a three year grant of $260,000 from the Lucent Foundation. This project aims to improve the experience of our trainee teachers in schools by training science teachers in teaching practice schools as mentors.</P>
    <P>In December 1999 we submitted a preliminary proposal to the Minister for Education and Science to set up a national centre for science education, based on the Limerick campus, and drawing on our long experience in this area. This proposal has support from the Colleges of Science and Education, and the full institutional backing of our President, Pro<Col N="348" /> fessor Roger Downer.</P>
    <P>In December 2000 we sent a detailed submission, with recommendations, to the Task Force for the Physical Sciences set up by Minister Woods.</P>
    <P>I am writing now to inform you and your Committee of our activities and proposals in the area of science education and science teacher training, and to support strongly the recommendation in your report for a science education technical support centre. I believe that our proposal for a national centre for science education at the University of Limerick would fulfil the functions that you suggest.</P>
    <P>We would be delighted to have the opportunity to brief your Committee on our activities and proposals at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Dr. Peter E. Childs</P>
    <P>We were delighted to receive this letter from Dr. Childs and have agreed that he should be invited to appear before the committee to discuss further the issues raised by him. I hope we will return to this issue of science and technology in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology did not think it worth his while to come into the House for this most important, though limited, debate.</P>
      <P>There has been a steady decline in the number of students taking science subjects at senior cycle. The decline is at its worst in chemistry in respect of which the participation rate has halved to only 10%. At 13.5% the position is a little better in respect of physics. These compare to a figure of 42% in respect of biology, which remains the dominant selection of the science subjects among pupils at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>The fall-off in the study of science seems to have accelerated in recent years. In the 1999-2000 school year alone, 3,200 fewer science papers were taken in the leaving certificate, a fall of 6.5% in one year. This highlights the systemic problem in the uptake and teaching of science, a topic which is fundamental to the development of the economy and the security of future employment growth.</P>
      <P>One of the keys aims of the IDA is to attract high-tech and research and development facilities. Yet industry is sounding alarm bells that the shortages will be substantial in sectors such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Low student demand for available science courses at third level remains a serious problem. There is an insufficient number of first preference applicants to match the number of places on offer. This has led to low entry requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drop-out rate also seems to be a factor. At least one-third of students taking science and <Col N="349" /> engineering courses at institutes of technology drop out. Drop-out levels in the universities are believed to be approximately 20% and at least 40% in institutes of technology. This is costing the Exchequer £23 million per annum in fees alone. One survey of three of the stronger institutes of technology found that the drop-out level in the sciences was 30%. The drop-out level for courses in general was 37% on average. In engineering courses, however, the drop-out level was 43%. Data on drop-out rates have never been collected systematically by the Department of Education and Science, which continues to turn a blind eye to this subject.</P>
    <P>The declining take-up of science at second level has undoubtedly contributed to the difficulty in attracting suitable candidates for science courses at third level. The committee heard evidence that there were a number of factors which contributed to drop-out rates at third level. Falling entry requirements for courses due to the lack of competition mean that students are poorly equipped to handle demanding courses. While students are efficient at leaving certificate level in memorising mathematical methods, those entering third level colleges have a poor grasp of the fundamentals of mathematical theory. A lack of practical experience in science at second level combined with poor training in problem solving and a poor knowledge of the fundamentals of a subject also contribute to drop-out rates. The financial burden placed on many students by way of inadequate maintenance grants and the cost of accommodation has placed pressure on students attending third level.</P>
    <P>A survey of second level schools found that 65% of science teachers had reported that they had insufficient equipment. Yet the Department of Education and Science has not conducted a proper audit of science equipment in schools. The £13 million investment programme planned by the Government over the next three years will come nowhere near filling the gaps in the system. The standard of science laboratories in many schools is poor. They are failing to meet even basic safety guidelines. Student lives are being put in danger.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I raised with the Minister for Education and Science the issue of hazardous chemicals stored in second level schools, many of which are unlabelled. Yet nothing has been done to remove and dispose of them. Rather than ensure the safety of pupils, the Minister has put the onus back on the boards of management of the schools concerned. An ASTI survey has concluded that up to 20% of second level schools are breaching the law by having no safety statement.</P>
    <P>The average class size in many science subjects is 24 students. By European standards this is extremely high. Large class sizes have a negative impact on student opportunities for participation <Col N="350" /> and interaction in many subjects, especially in science subjects which have a practical or experimental dimension. The absence of technical assistance restricts opportunities for practical and investigative work. There are concerns about the health and safety aspects of doing practical work in large classes without such support and assistance. Smaller class sizes would facilitate greater interaction between teachers and students and create greater opportunities for students to engage in active learning and development of their investigative skills rather than just listen to the teacher. A school/industry link should be developed. Personnel from industry, including retired workers, could assist with practical work and student projects.</P>
    <P>A fundamental element in improving the quality of teaching and health and safety in science laboratories should be the reduction of class sizes in scientific subjects. The Department does not have a proper database of laboratory facilities at second level. A questionnaire sent to schools by the Department revealed that 65% had insufficient equipment for physical science subjects. Over 75% had no computer in the laboratory while 95% indicated that a computer was not used for experimental data analysis. This is unbelievable. Sadly, the Department only decided to give us a glimpse of the report and was not prepared to make full information available to the committee in producing the report.</P>
    <P>It was alleged to the committee that there was a serious underestimation of the true cost of adequately equipping science laboratories in schools. The Department cites a figure of £30,000 to £35,000. A typical school would need at least two laboratories to offer a diverse a range of subjects. Against this background and the poor state of existing school laboratories, it seems the Department has grossly underestimated the figure.</P>
    <P>The committee is not satisfied with the Department's approach to equipping schools for science subjects. It should urgently arrange for schools to conduct an audit of facilities against a template being developed by the University of Limerick. This investment should be clearly linked to identified gaps in equipment and subject options, particularly evident in some schools. It should also be linked to specific programmes prepared by schools as part of their science plan. This approach would help to make up the deficit in weak schools and encourage innovation within schools.</P>
    <P>A further problem is that too few physics and chemistry graduates enter teaching. The preponderance of teachers who have trained in biology no doubt contributes to the dominance of this branch of science. The Department has introduced a three year training programme for physics and chemistry that will involve an investment of £3.8 million. This is welcome but it does not <Col N="351" /> overcome the distinctly poor professional development opportunities for science teachers in Ireland compared to other countries.</P>
    <P>The ICSTI study, &ldquo;Benchmarking of Irish Teaching of Science&rdquo;, was critical of the teaching methods which prevail in Ireland that are in conflict with the aims of the curriculum. The exclusive reliance on a term examination with no practical element compounds this. It has taken ten years to introduce the revised leaving certificate syllabus in physics and chemistry and it still has no element of practical assessment. There has been much discussion of the reform of the assessment methods, but no action. The recommendations of the steering group established to review this were rejected.</P>
    <P>While science and technology is playing an ever increasing role in our lives whether in the home, at work or in leisure activities, there still remains a poor public awareness of science and technology. The media has an important role to play in increasing national awareness but for such media awareness to improve it is fundamental that the scientific community embraces the need to communicate with the public. The scientific community has been very slow to enter public debate on scientific issues such as genetic engineering and continues to focus on pure scientific publication.</P>
    <P>I also recommended in the report that a committee of the House should be established to deal with science and technology issues ranging from bio-ethics to e-commerce. I hope the Minister's absence from the House is not a reflection of his inability to tackle the issues in this field. I further hope he will seriously examine this report and implement its recommendations. I commend the report to the House and look forward to its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the report and congratulate Deputies Naughten and Bruton on putting it together. It is long overdue. They addressed many of the fundamental issues that affect science and technology in Ireland. Like Deputy Naughten I am disappointed the Minister is not present to listen to the debate. I hope he takes note of the important aspects of this report.</P>
      <P>One of the fundamental reasons for the acute lack of science uptake at second and third level is a lack of understanding of what science entails, yet every aspect of our lives is driven by scientific and technological developments. I refer to developments such as mobile phones, GM foods, weather prediction, waste disposal, communications and BSE. All these topics depend on science and technology and have been debated recently in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very often hysteria and great concern among the public because of its lack of understanding of the fundamental principles underlying <Col N="352" /> certain events. The concern and hysteria that has surrounded scientific developments might be modified or even increased depending on the extent of our knowledge of the topic under debate. Making information available is crucial. The inability of scientists to communicate with the layman has been at the heart of much of this misunderstanding. Scientists use a jargon of their own that is not always readily comprehensible to the layman. The communication of science in a user friendly fashion needs to be examined carefully as it would help to remove some of the misunderstanding and hysteria that has surrounded scientific development.</P>
    <P>Apart from the influence of science and technology on our daily lives, it is also crucial to the economy. Much recent debate has evolved from the recognition of the impact of the shortage of science graduates on the economy. The media has an important role to play in producing user friendly, informative science programmes. That could be developed to a greater extent. There are few home grown science programmes on radio or television and this is a significant drawback in terms of the facility of the layman to understand what is going on.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the ethics of many of the scientific developments mentioned by Deputy Naughten. These will become more important and fundamental questions are being asked about the management of e-commerce, Internet access, genetic engineering and, for instance, the impact of gene sequencing on obtaining life assurance. An understanding of what is involved by both interested parties in these issues would be useful.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed and identified in regard to the different levels of science subject uptake. At primary level there is a serious dearth of interest in science. The level of funding set aside to develop science in primary schools sadly reflects a lack of interest. There will also be a requirement for the retraining of teachers if they are to engage effectively in the teaching of science. Many teachers who have come through the system would not necessarily have had a science background and in order to communicate science at primary school level there is a need for investment in retraining.</P>
    <P>The statistics speak for themselves regarding the problems at second level. The most acute problems relate to physics and chemistry. There are a number of reasons, some of which have been identified in the report. The leaving certificate is points driven. I have referred to this in previous debates and, while I am a great believer in the fundamental principle that surrounds the points system there are downsides, one of which is the perception that certain subjects are easy in terms of garnering points but physics and chemistry fall outside that fold. They are perceived as difficult and time consuming. There is, therefore, little return on the investment of a student's time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> As Deputy Naughten mentioned, laboratories are poorly resourced, facilities in many schools are non-existent or minimal and there is no practical element from an examination point of view. Teachers are not attracted to science and it is easy to understand why. The jobs available in certain industries are much more rewarding financially and something must be done to make the teaching of science more attractive. Only one physics graduate is taking the higher diploma in education at UCD. That is an indication of the lack of interest among science graduates in entering the teaching profession. Issues such as in-service training must also be considered and they have been identified in the report.</P>
    <P>The subsequent uptake at third level arising from the lack of interest at second level is easily identifiable. The numbers studying chemistry at third level is a source of serious concern to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. It is important to publish the retention rate for all science courses in third level colleges. There is anecdotal evidence for some colleges and statistical evidence for others. We will then be able to ascertain how many people are taking up a course in a given year; how many complete the course, whether it is a certificate, a diploma or a degree; and if they drop out, when they do so.</P>
    <P>There is a huge cost involved in this and the career guidance element of the uptake of science and technology courses must be examined again. Many students take the wrong option because the system is points driven and so on. At third level there is a need for an increase in industry involvement and the provision of work experience to give students a flavour of what it is like to work in industry. Companies should support science and technology courses arising from their interaction with various third level colleges. Third level and post-graduate funding for research has increased significantly, particularly relative to investment at primary and second levels. We need to look again at that distribution of funds.</P>
    <P>It is important to retain State funding to secure basic and independent research in many areas of science. That is evident when one looks at the pharmaceutical industry and some of the problems that have arisen with scientific developments that were industry funded rather than based on independent research.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the poor payment for post-graduate students and the poor rewards for somebody who is undertaking an intensive and demanding three or four years training. There is enormous cost to the State in training that student but how can we expect bright students with first class honours to go into research if the remuneration and rewards are not remotely comparable with what they might expect to earn in industry? Post-graduate funding and remuneration must be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be dealt with is the <Col N="354" /> reward for some science graduates. I am aware that those in the information technology and computing industries are relatively well rewarded. However, I know of a number of Ph.D. graduates who have a good degree and training in the biological sciences but they have taken it on themselves to convert to the information technology area because the remuneration in that sector is far greater than what they could expect to earn in other careers in science and technology. A study should be undertaken to find out what an average science graduate earns compared with the earnings of, for example, a commerce graduate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I only have five minutes to speak on this issue but I welcome the opportunity to do so. I wish to focus on the importance of science and technology promotion within the education system for sustaining growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Bruton on compiling this comprehensive report. It highlights the worrying decline in the uptake of science subjects in secondary schools. This is having a negative effect on science education at third level. Ireland's economy continues to grow at an impressive rate of between 8% and 10%. However, if this growth is to be sustainable and if we are to continue to attract foreign investment, we must continue to provide a large number of highly skilled employees.</P>
      <P>There are many examples of international companies which produce low value added product without a high skill requirement who have decided to relocate their operations to take advantage of lower wage cost structures elsewhere, particularly in eastern Europe and the Far East. Ireland can no longer be considered a low wage economy. One need only look at companies such as Fruit of the Loom in Donegal and certain operations within Apple computers in Cork to realise that companies will move to suit themselves. The sustainable jobs now being promoted by the IDA are jobs with a high skill content based on knowledge.</P>
      <P>When one asks companies why they locate in Ireland, they offer three reasons. First is tax policy and the low corporate tax rate, second is the standard of living for their employees and third is the level of graduate expertise within the workforce. If we do not continue to produce skilled science graduates, the number of science and research based companies setting up or locating in this country will decline. My constituency, Cork South-Central, is a European hub for the chemical industry and is making a huge contribution to the local, national and international economies. Companies such as Pfizer, Smyth Kline Beecham and Johnson and Johnson are huge employers. Now they are constantly recruiting and competing with each other for a finite and declining number of science graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> It is clear from the conclusions of this report that our education system is grossly under-resourced in the promotion of science education. There has been a steady decline in the numbers taking science subjects in schools. We must attempt to reverse this trend. It is obvious that we must introduce some level of science education into primary schools. Ireland is one of the few countries in the western world that does not provide science education at primary level. It is time to change that.</P>
    <P>There must be a national assessment and, if necessary, an overhaul of equipment in schools to ensure there is a common standard throughout our schools. There is also a strong perception among students that taking scientific subjects for examinations, particularly the leaving certificate, will make it more difficult to get points. We must act to reverse that view and, if necessary, give bonus points for achievements in science.</P>
    <P>In relation to third level education, I favour the promotion of research and development at third level and promoting a link with industry to make it more relevant.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. The Minister visited the Christian Brothers secondary school in Midleton recently and was welcomed by students and staff. It is an excellent school with excellent results and hardworking staff. However, as the Minister saw during his visit, the school is in urgent need of refurbishment.</P>
      <P>The heating system broke down before Christmas and it was thought the school would have to close but everybody soldiered on. However, it was discovered that there is major under floor corrosion in the school and that must be dealt with. The two prefab buildings which were erected in 1979 are falling apart. The school is operating at full capacity and needs additional classrooms particularly given projections that 10,000 extra houses will be built in the catchment area within the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have just had a debate on science. This school is badly in need of a new science laboratory for chemistry. The two existing laboratories are in urgent need of refurbishment to bring them to modern standards of efficiency and safety. There is concern about the safety of the laboratories at present. In 1979 an application was made to the Department for replacement of windows in the main block. They are in an advanced state of decay and are in danger of falling out. But for the caretaker's work they would have fallen out long <Col N="356" /> ago, possibly resulting in injury to a student, teacher or staff member.</P>
    <P>A new staff room and administration meeting rooms are required. Internal refurbishments are badly needed. The Minister saw during his visit how urgently they are required. Furniture, equipment, floor coverings, ceiling panels, window blinds and so forth must be refurbished. Internal refurbishment is urgently needed as the Minister saw for himself when he visited the school. Furniture, equipment, floor covering, ceiling panels, window blinds etc., must all be replaced. The school is literally falling down. The driveway and car park are also in need of renovation, as is the basketball court. I acknowledge the departmental approval for the provision of a new PE hall this year but the entire project is being delayed due to a lack of movement from the Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the departmental staff are under pressure and are doing their best but I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the staff, the students and their parents, to progress this matter urgently. I urge him to provide funding to allow the much needed work at the school to proceed. I understand there are some concerns in regard to future enrolments in the schools in the area but projected housing figures show that at least 10,000 additional houses will be built in the immediate catchment area within the next 20 years. I am sure the Minister does not intend to close down the school which has a current enrolment of 450 students. Those students deserve the best but are not getting it.</P>

I assure the Deputy that this tremendous school, which has great potential, will not be closed and I agree with him that it is located in an area of high development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has agreed, in principle, to fund the provision of a 680 square metre PE hall at the school. In line with the current procedure, the school authorities were authorised in February 2000 to appoint a design team from a shortlist compiled from the Department's approved list of consultants. The school authorities confirmed the appointment of the design team for the project in June 2000. However, the school authorities recently decided to have their overall accommodation requirements assessed by the Department's planning and building unit and put the PE project on hold <i>pro tem.</i>The Department's planning section is examining long-term enrolments and will forward its assessment to the school authorities for their acceptance and-or observations. When the school authorities respond, and subject to agreement on the question of enrolments, the post-primary <Col N="357" /> building unit of my Department will ask the school to complete and educational worksheet on the basis of the agreed enrolment figure. This will enable my Department's senior inspector to complete a schedule of overall and residual accommodation based on the school's curricular needs.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - VTOS Funding.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies will have received a large volume of correspondence in recent days or weeks from VTOS co-ordinators and staff in regard to the low level of funding provided to the scheme. Since the scheme's inception in 1989, its allocation has remained static. An annual allocation of £15,000 per group of 20 or more participants continues to be paid out regardless of the increasing cost of maintenance, heating, rent, materials and general overheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work undertaken by VTOS co-ordinators <Col N="358" /> and tutors is unquestionably excellent. Many of those delivering the scheme carry out functions which are far beyond their remit as tutors and co-ordinators. Indeed, throughout the 1990s, when unemployment levels were considerably higher than they are now, VTOS proved itself one of the most successful and important labour market interventions available at the time. VTOS provided thousands of adults, mainly women, with an opportunity for second chance education. Many of those who successfully completed VTOS courses and proceeded to sit the junior and leaving certificate examinations are now attending third level or have successful careers. The most recent statistics available indicate that of the participants who completed VTOS courses between 1994 and 2000, more than 70% progressed to further education or employment. Others who may not have been as successful can now assist their children with their homework and studies.</P>
    <P>Due to the fall in unemployment levels, the focus has moved away from VTOS and other labour market interventions. However, such interventions remain very important and continued efforts must be made to build and develop these schemes. The people on the live register represent a hard core of unemployment. Many of them gave up their job seeking efforts long ago. Their confidence is so low and their social problems are so complex that a move straight into employment would be disastrous. Focused labour market interventions which provide one to one attention and which would instil confidence are crucial to breaking down this hard core. VTOS can meet the needs of adults who have been excluded from both the education system and the labour market for extended periods.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the VTOS payment structure. Students are paid a training allowance and additional travelling expenses. While I believe more can be done to improve financial supports to VTOS students, such as child care expenses or on-site child care provision, the main issue I am questioning is the £15,000 annual allocation paid by the Department in respect of each group of more than 20 VTOS participants. I do not accept that this amount cannot be increased due to a lack of resources. With a degree of will, it should be possible to increase this amount to a level which would be in line with the increasing cost of computers, heating, rent and other key costs associated with the successful running of VTOS courses. I hope the Minister will favourably consider improving the financial resources for the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for recognising the scheme's importance, as we all do. The scheme was established in 1989 as a special initiative to cater for the education and training needs of the long-term unemployed. <Col N="359" /> The Deputy recognised that fewer people are now availing of the scheme due to increased employment levels but it still has a very important role to play in offering adults aged 21 or over, who have been unemployed for at least six months, an opportunity for second chance education. The scheme involves 30 hours course attendance and can last for up to two years.</P>
      <P>The work of the vocational education committees in this area is well recognised with some 99 centres throughout the country catering for 5,000 participants. A huge range of vocational options is on offer ranging from NCVA foundation level to level 2 or post-leaving certificate. Various subjects at junior and leaving certificate level are also on offer or students may acquire a portfolio of other qualifications in line with their needs and interests. The courses are free of charge, as are books and materials. Students also receive travelling expenses and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS. Participants cease to retain unemployment payments but are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. However, they retain secondary benefits such as rent allowances.</P>
      <P>While the scheme is primarily for people on unemployment assistance or benefit, there had for some years been a provision whereby a maximum of 10% of VTOS places could be taken by lone parents, people in receipt of disability allowances and dependent spouses of those eligible to join VTOS. In November 1998 the 10% quota was removed in response to sustained demand and participants in these categories may now join VTOS on an equal footing with other eligible groups.</P>
      <P>The scheme has proved to be successful in opening learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. It has been responsive to the requirements of employers as it equips participants with a range of general education and vocational qualifications and a wide range of core transferable skills. The percentage of participants who completed the programme between 1994 and 2000 and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The current cost of this programme is £32 million and was part-funded until 1999 by the European Social Fund. This includes tuition costs allowances to students and non-pay funding for general overheads. As Deputy Upton mentioned, the VTOS non-pay funding of £15,000, the annual grant paid by the Department to vocational education committees, has not been increased since 1989. We are aware that the costs generally have increased since then but it has not been possible to correspondingly increase this grant. However, it is important to point out that improvements have been made in the other supports available to VTOS students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> To ensure equality of treatment in terms of education and training allowances, the rates of allowances on VTOS and the back to education scheme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs were equalised in 1998. VTOS students in receipt of unemployment payments prior to going on VTOS are now paid training allowance equivalent to the maximum standard rate of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In September 1999 a training bonus of £25 a week was introduced for participants registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme. This extra allowance is seen as an important incentive in encouraging the most marginalised in the labour market to take the important step in returning to education and training. A new management structure has recently been put in place for VTOS centres. Additionally, vocational education committees can now appoint permanent teachers to the VTOS and this costs £1.5 million <i>per annum.</i>A scheme of grants for child care has been provided to facilitate the attendance of people otherwise prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. Deputy Upton rightly pointed out that a number of the participants are women, single mothers and lone parents as well.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, clearly identifies objectives in relation to education and training so that every individual can attain an adequate level of literacy and numeracy. Lifelong learning is the central theme of this plan to address unemployment and social exclusion and emerging skill and labour shortages. Additionally, the recently published White Paper on Adult Education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, sets out a rationale for investment in adult education and the principles which underpin it.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of VTOS is to reach those most in need, particularly older unemployed people and those with the lowest educational skills. It is the intention to review the terms of the VTOS in the context of a consultancy study currently being undertaken with a view to making the scheme even more effective in reaching the people hardest to reach.</P>
    <P>The back to education initiative proposes to expand VTOS, Youthreach, post-leaving certificate courses and senior traveller training programmes on a part-time basis. It is our intention that this new initiative will address the increase in demand for places and provide flexibility in the provision of programmes to meet the demands of adults wishing to return to education and training. This initiative will be an important step in providing flexible progression pathways, particularly at foundation level, to enable adults to move from the literacy service into modular part-time programmes. As part of this strategy, improvements in class size of a 10:1 ratio are proposed for all participants in the back to education <Col N="361" /> initiative with less than upper secondary education.</P>
    <P>The number of persons projected to avail of the back to education initiative is approximately 320,000 and expenditure will amount to £1.027 billion over the period of the national development plan. It is intended that the resources for the VTOS programme will be examined in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is serious concern in County Donegal about the rumoured downgrading of the breast cancer clinic in Letterkenny General Hospital. This concern results from the report by Professor Niall O'Higgins which recommends the creation of a number of specialised breast cancer treatment centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>People are afraid that Sligo or another location further away may become the treatment centre for all Donegal patients. While the development of breast cancer centres is highly desirable it should not be done to the detriment of services already located in Letterkenny General Hospital. Hundreds of women are screened every year for breast cancer in Letterkenny General Hospital and up to 50 patients undergo treatment there with positive results. If these patients had to travel longer distances to Galway, Sligo, Dublin from places such as Buncrana, Fanad, Gweedore, Glencolmcille or the islands, the inconvenience would be so prohibitive that some women may delay seeking advice and diagnosis and leave it too late for effective treatment.</P>
      <P>While I do not object to developing the breast cancer facilities in Sligo the long journey to Sligo would further add to the distress of these women. There is no direct public transport for most of County Donegal to Sligo and in many cases this would necessitate an overnight stay <i>en route</i>. The islanders, especially those living on Tory, Aranmore, Inisbofin and Inisfree, have the extra worry of their journey to the mainland being weather dependent for at least six months of the year.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,670 women are newly diagnosed with breast cancer annually. Approximately 650 die from the disease each year. Some 43% of women who develop breast cancer die compared to an overall mortality rate of 37% of the European Union and as low as 30% in some countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any decision that would result in women postponing treatment could have disastrous consequences. The prospects of travelling long distances for treatment is a source of considerable distress for many women. When one's life is under threat from this dreadful disease, not only is the best medical care available needed but also the support of family and friends and not the trauma of isolation from home, family and community. Donegal women want and are entitled to <Col N="362" /> the option of staying close to their families and friends and have the greatest confidence in the treatment facilities and medical personnel in Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The O'Higgins report envisaged a degree of co-operation between Letterkenny General Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. There is already co-operation between these two hospitals in other areas of medical treatment. While I am in favour of such co-operation it cannot and should not be achieved by downgrading facilities in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>What the people of Donegal demand is extra investment to provide the necessary medical equipment in Letterkenny and also the additional personnel such as radiologists, pathologists and oncologists to provide the highest standard of treatment for Donegal patients in their own county.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to allocate the necessary resources so that the already excellent resources in Letterkenny General Hospital can be further improved to benefit health care and, particularly, the prevention of breast cancer and the treatment of breast cancer in Donegal. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

Athnaímíd cé chomh uafásach is atá an galar sin agus an tslí a chuireann sé isteach, ní h-amháin ar mná, ach ar a gclann agus gach duine a bhaineann leo.

      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I am glad of the opportunity to set out the situation in relation to the development of breast cancer services in the North Western Health Board area, including those at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley is aware that there have been substantial developments in the care and treatment of patients with cancer throughout the country over the past number of years. Major developments in the treatment and care of patients with cancer have taken place since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy. The principal objectives of the strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer and to ensure that those who develop the disease receive the most effective treatment and care.</P>
      <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. To achieve the objectives set out in the cancer strategy, some £60 million of targeted development funding has been allocated between 1997 and 2001 to develop a range of cancer services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the more significant features of the <Col N="363" /> developments to date are the provision and development of consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, palliative care, histopathology and the introduction of the national breast and cervical screening programmes.</P>
    <P>It is intended to continue to build on these significant developments. In this regard, at the request of the previous Minister for Health and Children, the National Cancer Forum, which was established and appointed by his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, to advise on the appropriate developments and structures in the area of cancer, set up a specialist expert group to examine the symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The overriding objective underlying this review was to develop our breast cancer treatment services to an optimal level that ensures the highest possible quality of care and the best opportunity for long-term survival for breast cancer patients. A sub-group of the National Cancer Forum undertook a detailed review of the symptomatic breast cancer services and its recommendations are contained in a report entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease. The broad thrust of the report has been accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific recommendations concerning services in the North Western Health Board area, the report recommends that there should be one specialist breast unit in the area. There is acknowledgement in the report that a service is currently being provided in both Sligo and Letterkenny. In Letterkenny, a committed group of people is currently providing symptomatic breast disease services. However, there is not a sufficient volume of patients to develop and maintain the expertise of the staff concerned. The board is currently considering how best to utilise the expertise present in this unit and is exploring the possibility of linking with a unit in Northern Ireland with a view to coming to an arrangement to increase caseload, experience, expertise and formal cross-cover.</P>
    <P>The North Western Health Board is actively engaged in discussions with many interested parties in endeavouring to put proposals together on this. The board has cognisance of the fact that whatever services are put in place must be of the highest standards possible and that outcomes for patients would be favourably comparable with international standards. To this end, the board is in consultation with Northern Ireland bodies such as the Altnagelvin Hospital Trust and the Northern Ireland Health Services while at the same time having discussions with its own hospital consultants and management.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is confident that these deliberations and consultations on the future provision of services for symptomatic <Col N="364" /> breast disease will result in an enhancement of the services currently being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In a Dáil reply from the Minister for Health and Children on 30 January 2001, I was shocked to learn that 32,000 children are waiting for orthodontic assessment and treatment. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, 11,000 children are awaiting assessment and 900 children are awaiting treatment, coupled with 5,000 children awaiting assessment for orthodontic treatment in the Southern Health Board area and 4,764 children awaiting treatment in the Cork-Kerry region. These are shocking statistics in a country which is enjoying economic success.</P>
      <P>The reality is that a family will get treatment for their child almost immediately by paying for it. A family which cannot raise the money for private treatment and is dependent on the public service will be unable to get their children treated as they will be waiting at least two years for assessment and a further four to five years for treatment. Children who have crooked teeth and need treatment are past school age by the time their turn comes but they are then eliminated from the waiting list.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic treatment is costing anything between £2,000 and £3,000 per child in the private sector. I am aware of many families who are forced to take out credit union or bank loans and I know of two families in the Cork area who have gone to illegal moneylenders, or loan sharks, to get the money to have their children treated because they recognise that children who fail to get treatment not only suffer the disability but also often suffer severe damage to their self-esteem and personal development.</P>
      <P>In a recent letter to me a consultant orthodontist working with the Southern Health Board admitted that the national service for orthodontic treatment is &ldquo;disintegrating&rdquo;, with four to five year waiting periods for treatment. That long waiting period, coupled with the number of children on the list, is nothing short of a health scandal and the figures I quoted are matched <i>pro rata</i> by the figures for the Mid-Western Health Board, which has 2,752 children awaiting assessment and 1,488 awaiting treatment. The Western Health Board has 2,267 children awaiting treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is so bad that I will quote the consultant orthodontist in the Southern Health Board area who stated: &ldquo;Currently we are calling patients who were placed on the list in March 1997, and there are almost 4,000 children awaiting orthodontic treatment&rdquo;. He went on to state: &ldquo;Unfortunately the situation is not being helped by the haphazard and disorganised approach that the Department of Health is taking towards orthodontics&rdquo;. He further stated: &ldquo;Orthodontic <Col N="365" /> treatment is in a worse situation in January 2001 than it was in January 2000&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The responsibility is therefore fairly and squarely on the Minister's shoulders. I was taken aback by a further response I got from him last week when I asked him the number of out-patients awaiting an appointment in each of the public hospitals, and the average waiting time. The Minister told me that his Department does not keep those statistics and that they do not gather them from the health boards. This self-imposed ignorance on the part of the Minister and his Department is a Pontius Pilate act in that he seems to be following the theory that what he does not know does not worry him, or it is not his responsibility once he does not know about it.</P>
    <P>In all the hype and the public relations from the Department of Health and Children, the figures I quoted speak for themselves. Young people are being deprived of the necessary dental treatment and that deprivation is impacting seriously on their well-being. I would like the Minister of State in response to state specifically the steps that are currently being taken to deal with this scandal.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for taking time out of his busy schedule today to raise what is an important issue. It is long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of the Department of Health and Children, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the provision of additional resources provided under the dental health action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the dental health action plan to be achieved. One of the recommendations of the review group was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. In line with this, my Department is working to progress with the relevant authorities the establishment of training programmes for dentists working in the units to allow them to reach the level of specialist. The Dental Council has set up a specialist register which will recognise a dental specialty in orthodontics. An accord is being reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. These measures are being supported by my Department through the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board. Ultimately, the effect envisaged is that the <Col N="366" /> number of specialists in training for health boards will be significantly increased. The Department has also funded a full professorial post in the Cork Dental School and Hospital to enable them to develop a programme for specialist training in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, the Minister for Health and Children asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists.</P>
    <P>An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The Southern Health Board has been allocated an additional £0.938 million for the development of its orthodontic service this year. The additional funding will enable the board to recruit additional orthodontic staff and provide additional services from private practitioners at approved rates. The Southern Health Board proposes to use part of the additional £0.938 million to develop one new orthodontic unit in Kerry and to increase its number of orthodontic chairs in Cork from six to ten. It will also validate existing waiting lists as part of the overall review of the service. These proposals will, in effect, double the capacity of the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment and the maintenance of information on numbers in treatment and on waiting lists are the responsibility of the health boards. I understand from the most recent information supplied to the Department by the Southern Health Board that there are 5,000 children on the waiting list for orthodontic assessment and 4,764 on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in that region.</P>
    <P>Most independent observers would agree that the quality of the work carried out in regional units is of the highest standard. The demand for orthodontics is much greater than can be provided in any developed country and the provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is expensive. It is important, therefore, that resources be used as efficiently as possible for those patients most severely affected. Accordingly, health boards assess patients for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department and, where appropriate, place individuals on waiting lists. The Minister is concerned at the size of the waiting lists nationally and has asked that officials review the situation as a priority.</P>
    <P>The dental health action plan provides for the development of a consultant led orthodontic service by each health board which aims to ensure a service of high quality and high service levels. Seven of the boards have established a consultant led service and the Midland Health Board avails of the services of orthodontists in private practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register in orthodontics and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health service should mean a substantial improvement in the recruitment and retention issues and, consequently, in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. The issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the Health Services Employers' Agency. The creation of this grade should increase the attractiveness of the public service as a career option for dentists with specialist skills in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>I am assured that all patients are taken off waiting lists for assessment and treatment in strict order of priority in accordance with the Department's guidelines. It has also been clarified that a delay in providing orthodontic treatment does not impact on a successful clinical outcome. The Department's target is that no child should be <Col N="368" /> more than two years on a waiting list for treatment. The Southern Health Board is committed to reducing waiting times to less than 12 months.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the Dental Council to consider the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. This grade would act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved. The Southern Health Board is striving to improve its orthodontic services to an acceptable level and will have the full support of the Department is so doing.</P>

      <P>Ireland has one of Europe's largest offshore areas and to date most marine related research in Irish waters has been conducted on foreign research vessels. The new marine research vessel, the rv <i>Celtic Explorer </i>will enable us, for the first time, to explore our entire offshore waters.</P>
      <P>This new purpose-built, marine research vessel will contribute significantly to the planned national atlantic seabed survey. The survey will be the largest and most comprehensive ever undertaken in Irish waters and will be carried out over a seven year period. Ireland is the only EU country without a territory wide seabed mapping programme, and yet it is one of those with most to gain. It is essential that the Irish offshore area is fully charted to understand and deliver on the full developmental potential of our marine area. The survey will provide an integrated databank for use by fishermen, engineers, biologists, oceanographers, exploration interests and geologists. The rv <i>Celtic Explorer</i> will also engage in fisheries management studies, mineral exploration, pollution monitoring, environmental and oceanographic surveys, underwater exploration, acoustic fish surveys and testing of marine instruments. The 65 metre vessel will be built in Holland and it is expected that it will be delivered to the Marine Institute in September 2002.</P>
      <P>The cost of the vessel, including actual construction, will be £24.9 million and is funded under the productive sector operational programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>If I decided to grant permission, it would be conditional on planning permission being obtained before any reclamation commenced, as already advised in my reply to Questions Nos. 10, 13, 42 and 50 on 10 February 2000.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the details of the incident referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Sikorksy S6IM helicopter, which was tasked at 11.55, was airborne from Dublin Airport at 12.06 on 29 October 2000 and arrived on scene at 12.50. The flight time was 44 minutes and the time from tasking was 55 minutes. This response time is well within accepted international norms for response to marine emergency incidents.</P>
      <P>The Alouette 111 single engined helicopter based at Waterford was not tasked because the incident location, 17 nautical miles from Rosslare, was well outside the Air Corps declared operational capability of the aircraft, that is, it was more than three nautical miles offshore and top cover was not available. This aircraft, due to its visual contact flight conditions, daylight only restricted range, is not particularly suited for offshore marine emergency helicopter cover. It is, however, well suited for mountain, cliff and close in marine search and rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Alouette is in replacement on a temporary basis of the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen. My Department is working closely with the Department of Defence to urgently replace the Alouette with an all weather night flying capacity at Waterford.</P>

The position regarding the Corrib gas field is that last month Enterprise Energy Ireland, acting as operator for the development of the Corrib gas field, declared it commercial on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited and sought a lease from me for its development. This is at present being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland have plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expect the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
      <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department, where it is analysed using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential. However, I should point out that Enterprise Energy Ireland are reported as saying that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas.</P>
      <P>As regards the Helvick oil field, the position is that Providence Resources completed an appraisal well on the oil field in the Celtic Sea in September last year. The drilling and tests results have been reviewed in detail over the last few months. Although the tests results on the well confirmed the good reservoir and oil characteristics seen on the original Helvick oil discovery well in 1983, further detailed analysis has indicated that the Helvick reservoir is much smaller than had been hoped and is highly compartmentalised. Accordingly Providence Resources has concluded that a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; development of Helvick cannot be justified. Following analysis of the data obtained in 2000 my technical advisors have indicated that Helvick is not commercial.</P>
      <P>Providence Resources has other interests in the Celtic Sea, which include blocks 50/6 and 7, 50/11 and the Ardmore gas prospect. The company has indicated that it remains committed to realising value from its Celtic Sea assets but the fact that Helvick cannot be made commercial has resulted in Providence Resources reviewing its plans for the Celtic Sea as a whole and conducting a strategic appraisal of a number of business development options. My Department is currently in discussion with Providence Resources about restructuring their authorisations in the east Celtic Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 21 exploration licences in place covering 106 blocks or part blocks. In addition, eight offshore licensing options and two leases are in place. Applications for a further licensing option <Col N="376" /> and three lease undertakings are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>I expect to see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity this year with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled. However, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore and there is a possibility that many of the frontier exploration licences issued in previous licensing rounds will be relinquished this year.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I have commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving areas of the Irish offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have started a consultation process involving companies who are licence holders here in order to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's reference to the as yet untapped reserves of oil and gas, the fact remains that Irish prospectivity is low with only three successful exploration wells out of 122 wells in 30 years. Whether we like it or not, Irish offshore prospectivity is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours &ndash; in the same period some 7,000 wells were drilled in the North Sea.</P>
    <P>The Corrib find, although very welcome, cannot be regarded as changing that view. Only one exploration well was drilled in the Irish offshore in the last three years of the 1990s, despite the existence of the 1992 terms. While we expect three exploration wells to be drilled in 2001, commitments beyond that amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore. It is possible that many of the frontier exploration licences issued in the few rounds will be relinquished this year. Not only are we competing with the relatively low risk, highly prospective North Sea but also with current development &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in North and West Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the Caspian region.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing high level of interest shown in exploration for non-petroleum minerals. Indeed it is gratifying that we have not only maintained, but increased in real terms, our share of world exploration funding in the context of a major global cutback over the past three years. The most recent report that I laid before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts showed that at the end of December 2000 there were 480 prospecting licences being operated. The number of licences has increased over the last three years. We are actively engaged in promoting investment interest in minerals exploration from overseas companies, in order to keep the level of exploration in the country as high as possible.</P>
    <P>The State itself does not carry out prospecting. In setting and agreeing the exploration programme under any licence, I ensure the licence is awarded to the candidate proposing the most <Col N="377" /> advantageous programme. By monitoring the reports of licence holders and site visits, I ensure that the terms of the commitment are met in each case, that we are immediately aware of finding any significant mineralisation and that there is a suitably aggressive pursuit of any positive results. Whenever a commercial find is made it is evidenced to me by an application for a State mining facility. This is made in parallel with applications to the relevant local authority for planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and to the EPA for an integrated pollution control licence.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the attractiveness of Ireland, my Department is at present carrying out a comparative study of international royalty and tax regimes. We are at present examining the preliminary results of that study. That examination and the further study results will inform policy decisions in the future and allow us to maintain our competitive status.</P>

      <P>The coastal zone is an area of considerable importance in ecological and amenity terms and from the socio-economic perspective, and effective arrangements and procedures for its integrated management in accordance with the principles of sustainability are essential. A report on coastal zone management policy, prepared for my Department and the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands by Brady Shipman Martin and others, was published in 1997. Work by the public bodies concerned on the development of comprehensive policy proposals for an effective coastal zone management framework will be informed by this report, and will take account also of ongoing EU discussions concerning a proposed Council recommendation on integrated coastal zone management. Experience with important local initiatives such as the Bantry Bay Coastal Zone Charter will also constitute a valuable input into the development of coastal zone management planning and policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority in recent years has been given to the introduction of new legislation and frameworks in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, planning and development, aquaculture regulation and dumping at sea, as well as local initiatives such as CLAMS. The way is now becoming clear for bringing forward new frameworks which will focus on the interaction between different sectors, agencies and legal frameworks with a view to bringing about a more integrated and holistic approach to coastal zone management. It is the intention in so far as my Department's responsi<Col N="378" /> bilities are concerned to have new legislation brought forward next year.</P>

      <P>The review of the Common Fisheries Policy takes place in 2002. The Commission will shortly publish a Green Paper on fisheries policy which will be comprehensively debated in the coming months. I have highlighted to Commissioner Fischler in my discussions with him to date the need for radical thinking in relation to conservational fleet management, enforcement, regionalisation and greater involvement of the fishing industry in decision-making, and recognition of the socio-economic importance of coastal inshore fisheries. I expect the Commission's Green Paper to reflect in no small degree those important themes. Ireland's negotiating position up to and during the review will continue to be informed by the work of the national CFP strategy review group, and I will work to maximise the position of the Irish fishing industry in the forthcoming debate.</P>

      <P>The provision of financial compensation for occurrences such as fuel prices is not permissible under EU State aid rules for the fisheries and aquaculture sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, high fuel prices, labour shortages and whitefish quota constraints highlight the need <Col N="379" /> for the fishing sector to adjust and adapt to a changing and increasingly difficult environment. In this scenario all the analysis points to the need to focus on quality assurance, safety and fuel efficiency as key priorities. I announced in December last details of a £4 million funding initiative to deliver enhanced operational standards in the industry and to support improvements in the fuel efficiency of fishing vessels. The fish quality and safety assurance scheme, which entails incentivised safety and quality training programmes for skippers and crews, and the fuel efficiency grant scheme are both being implemented by BIM. These schemes will contribute to improved quality safety and efficiency and best environmental practice thus assisting the fishing sector to position itself more effectively to overcome the challenges it faces.</P>

      <P>In October 1999, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established a national seaweed forum. The principal objective in establishing this forum was to bring together all the relevant interests and expertise in the Irish seaweed sector to evaluate and advise on possible strategies to realise the development potential of the resource. This included the identification of the means by which the sector could maximise its contribution to the national economy and enhance the economic and social well-being of coastal regions and communities, particularly Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>My Department has undertaken its review of beam trawling activity by vessels in the Irish fishing fleet in the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and in the first half of 2000. The review indicates that, in addition to the six vessels in the dedicated beam trawler segment, an average of 15 vessels per year in the polyvalent segment engaged in beam trawling for a significant proportion of their time during the reference period. As I have previously advised the Deputy, it is the long-standing position that a number of vessels in the polyvalent segment are not legally precluded from fishing by means of beam trawls where they are licensed to engage in beam trawling for a proportion of their fishing time. My Department intends to rigorously review the sustainable level as well as the locus of beam trawling activity within the fleet in the context of an overall review of fishing vessel licensing and fleet management policy. Further in-depth analysis of all the issues will be required, including consultation with the industry itself, over the coming months.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I have asked the Department to ensure that there is enhanced monitoring of all beam trawling activity which will assist in the task of quantifying the actual level of effort by this type of gear, the impact of that effort and in determining future management and licensing strategies.</P>

      <P>As I have already advised the House, the tagging scheme for wild salmon and sea trout was introduced on 1 January 2001 to provide a verifiable count of the wild salmon catch by all sectors. Salmon tagging is recognised internationally as an important management information tool to inform conservation strategies. The scheme was first recommended by the salmon task force in 1996 and endorsed by the Oireachtas in debates on the two Fisheries (Amendment) Bills in 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the fisheries boards that compliance with the tagging of fish caught has been satisfactory overall. One angling organisation has, however, been vocal in its opposition to the logbook requirements in particular. I have met the organisation in question and set out my position on each of their five stated areas of concern. On the information being sought in the logbook, I have decided that the amount of information to be supplied will be reduced forthwith. This step will build confidence in the tagging scheme overall and lead to compliance by all concerned with the legal requirements of the tagging scheme. My Department is putting in train the necessary legal and other steps. I will also be asking the national salmon commission to further review the logbook requirements for 2002 in the light of experience this year.</P>

      <P>Minister Winberg and I had very useful and comprehensive discussions in Dublin on 15 January. Our discussions covered all the key issues on the EU fisheries agenda, including the CFP review, the European Commission's forthcoming Green Paper, EU fleet capacity management and stock recovery programmes for cod and hake. I underlined the need for greater protection of fish stocks generally through radical new technical conservation measures and enhanced control and enforcement and looked for the support of the Presidency in progressing these as priority concerns.</P>
      <P>The Swedish Presidency is giving key priority to the integration of environmental considerations into fisheries policy which will be discussed at the Council of Ministers next month with a view to agreeing conclusions on future directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply to a similar question raised in the House on 23 November 2000, my Department set up and is facilitating discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. Exploration and production companies employ Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>In an address to the Institute of Petroleum last November, I made it clear that the Government does not expect the industry to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where these are clearly uncompetitive. The Government does, however, expect the industry to encourage and facilitate potential Irish suppliers to compete for the services required. This should be done in partnership with State agencies and should be seen as part of the industry's commitment to Ireland, within a long-term commercial and marketing framework. Any company operating in Ireland for the long-term should see that it is in its own best commercial interest to build strong links into the Irish economy and to demonstrate a significant economic and social dividend both at regional and national level.</P>
      <P>Arising from the discussions being facilitated by my Department, the IOOA and FÁS, in consultation with SIPTU, have established a procedure to identify suitably qualified personnel who wish to be considered for any specific vacancies for work both in the development of the Corrib field and in the Irish offshore. This procedure was advertised last month by FÁS in the national press. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has the co-operation of the Irish Offshore Operators Association and individual operators to ensure there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish suppliers. I am glad to say that the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully support these opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier at Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development lies with the local authority. Accordingly, it is a matter for the county council, in the first instance, to bring forward proposals for capital investment. Funding of £125,000 was provided last year to the county council to support essential safety and maintenance works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, 1,303.8 tonnes, live weight, were landed at Clogherhead and 5,548.2 tonnes, live <Col N="385" /> weight, were landed at Howth. The annual value of the landings at Clogherhead is of the order of £1.8 million whereas the value of landings at Howth is £8.4 million.</P>
    <P>In 1998 Louth County Council commissioned consulting engineers to undertake a technical assessment of the development needs of the harbour. Their report, which examined a range of options, recommended extending the pier, the construction of a breakwater and dredging works. The cost of these capital works was estimated at that time to be in excess of £3 million.</P>
    <P>Any major capital investment proposed would require, in the first instance, a comprehensive cost benefit analysis having regard to all relevant economic and socio-economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, the extent to which displacement is a factor, as suggested by the Deputy, fleet trends and regional and local considerations. It is also the case that existing funding for major fishery harbour development work is oversubscribed. Development options in relation to Clogherhead will be kept under review in that context and my Department will be consulting further with Louth County Council on the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>A thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into Accident DH 248/Rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 1999 has taken place in my Department. The following is the response of my Department to the Recommendations which relate specifically to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (detailed in Appendix 1). It follows the numbering set out in the report:</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.14. My Department has in place training programmes for Coast Guard Units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of incidents of serious aircraft accidents. On 14 October 2000, the chief fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and rescue techniques at the Coast Guard Area Officers' Annual Conference in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation 4.15. My Department accepts the need for formalising current relationships and <Col N="386" /> such agreements will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.16. My Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures that appropriate agreements to the Department's satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. It should be noted that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.21. My Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses, <i>inter alia</i>, aviation awareness. At the recent three weeks search and rescue mission co-ordinator's course attended by six staff a two day aviation awareness module was introduced.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.22. The maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately these type of circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, the Civil Defence, CIL and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are already available. The level of call out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually. A key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>In August 1999, an action group was established to review the use of small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, and to recommend a best practice model for local and national management of personal watercraft and fast power craft in Ireland. The terms of reference of the group foresaw the submission of an interim report by November and a final report in early 2000. The interim report was delivered in November 1999, with the final report in March 2000. These reports made recommendations on the form of framework legislation required to regulate the sector. On foot of this, the framework legislation was included as an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, as part of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, which was enacted on 27 June 2000.</P>
    <P>This legislation empowers me to provide for the enactment by local authorities and other bodies with jurisdiction over water bodies of by-laws to control the use of recreational craft in areas under their jurisdiction and also to make regulations on national provisions governing the safe use of such craft which will include regulations on age restrictions, the carriage and use of safety equipment and the consumption of alcohol and drugs. Draft regulations on these matters are currently being discussed with the parliamentary counsel to the Government. On 28 January last I <Col N="387" /> announced that I intend to put in place new legislation which will see the introduction of mandatory safety training for fishermen in Ireland. This initiative will also include new statutory measures requiring fishermen to wear suitable personal flotation devices. I have asked my Department and BIM to liaise with the fishing industry with a view to finalising the detailed provisions for the proposed mandatory requirements with a view to their introduction as early as practicable.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.25. My Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not a contractual one and proficiency of crews and assets is primarily for the military authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Department of Defence to ensure immediate and sustained action on the implementation of recommendations made in the report. A joint group of the two Departments has been set up to examine the recommendations of the report as a mater of urgency. A second working group of my Department and the Department of Defence has been set up on the subject of dedicated helicopter search and rescue assets. This group will, in tandem with the current tender competition for the supply of medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps, determine the overall helicopter resources required (civil and military) and the optimum deployment of same to cover the Irish search and rescue region. It will identify and make recommendations on the specific Air Corps resources which will have to be committed and deployed to meet those requirements. It will also consider all options, lease, extension of current contracts etc., for the provision of interim solutions for the overall requirements taking into account the lead time for the delivery of new medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps. My Department is involved in on-going discussions with the Department of Defence about the urgent replacement of the Alouette.</P>

      <P>As provided for in the Harbours Act, 1996, my Department has commissioned a statutory audit of the performance of the commercial State port companies which were corporatised in 1997 and afforded new corporate structures with commercial mandates, freedoms and accountabilities. Once the results of this audit, being carried out by independent expert consultants, are to hand I have asked my Department to commence the assessment, with outside expert assistance, of the case for change. Specifically, I have asked that we assess whether conditions &ndash; or the need &ndash; exist in Ireland to warrant change from our current operational/ management model for port companies.</P>
      <P>I want this study to be objective, open minded and based on an assessment of best practice models abroad and their relevance in an Irish context. I want the process to be inclusive with all stakeholders consulted and involved. I expect and envisage that the process will be well completed, and any new directions mapped out, by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My accountability as Minister and shareholder is to ensure that high standards are enforced, good structures, procedures and services are enhanced and that we have a port industry second to none. Whether this requires that we continue as we are or whether change is needed remains to be seen. The Deputy will agree that given the success of our economy we must in terms of sustainable transport mobility continually examine how our ports can be developed strategically <Col N="389" /> whilst also seeking, where possible, to remove heavy freight traffic from our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I recently outlined my plans for an expert task force to examine transport logistics relating to ports which will consider: transferring freight from road to rail including the development of rail-head facilities at existing ports and establish realistic targets to be achieved; transportation of freight by rail at night and during off-peak hours; opportunities for traffic diversion including by rail, by pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms and to other less congested ports outside Dublin; examine the prospects of increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and establish realistic targets to be achieved; identify cost effective options for the movement of traffic through Dublin and identify other imaginative proposals for transporting goods to and from ports. The composition of the group is currently being finalised and I intend to make a formal announcement in this regard shortly. The task force will have a tight six month time frame to finalise its report to me.</P>

WHO has not recommended a maximum daily intake for salmon.</P>
      <P>Polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs, are persistent organic pollutants that are principally the result of industrial processes. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been working closely with the Marine Institute which has been monitoring PCBs and other environmental contaminants in wild fish for a number of years, and more recently in farmed fish.</P>
      <P>There are as yet no EU standards for PCBs in fish. Analysis of sampling undertaken as part of the 1999 programme for Irish farmed fish shows that the concentration of PCBs was considerably lower than the strictest international standards. The Food Safety Authority has stated that based on the average level of oily fish consumption and the maximum PCB contamination levels found in Irish salmon, Irish consumers are not exposed to any appreciable risk.</P>

      <P>I am currently considering submissions from two friendly societies, seeking an increase in various financial limits applying to friendly societies. Financial limits cannot be increased for one society alone and increases would have to apply equally to all societies within a particular category of society. Therefore, before any increases are approved, I must be satisfied that all the friendly societies in each category would be in a position to finance such increased limits. To this end, I have been in discussion with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and, in response to a request from me, he has already undertaken a detailed financial inspection of a particular category of friendly society to assess the implications for them of the proposed increases. A similar financial analysis of other categories of friendly societies can be considered.</P>
      <P>In tandem with increased financial limits, I must also consider for prudential and solvency reasons extending the powers and regulatory authority of the registrar in respect of the affected societies. This would be achieved through a supervisory agreement to which each society would be required to give their assent. If these various aspects are satisfactorily concluded, I would then be in a position to make the necessary regulations.</P>

      <P>In my response to Parliamentary Question No. 178 of 30 January 2001, I indicated that my Department experienced a breach of e-mail security on two separate occasions within the past 12 months. The nature of the e-mail breach was what is commonly referred to in the industry as &ldquo;spamming&rdquo;. &ldquo;Spamming&rdquo; arises when an external e-mail is deliberately configured and sent to a mail server in order to dupe the mail server into thinking it is an e-mail coming from within the organisation. Consequently the mail server treats the e-mail as a normal e-mail and sends it to the nominated external addresses.</P>

    <P>The effect of this, in my Department's case, was that e-mails were distributed to a number of <Col N="391" /> external addressees and, from the recipients' perspective, the e-mails appeared to originate from my Department. However, I would emphasise that at no point was the integrity of my Department's internal systems breached and the e-mails were never actually introduced internally within the mail system in my Department. As regards the two e-mails that were circulated externally, the content of one appeared to be a &ldquo;spoof&rdquo; advertisement for driving instructions and the other did not have any body text material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no specific primary legislation or regulations on workplace bullying. The principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. This Act sets out the duties of an employer with regard to protecting the safety, health and welfare of his employees at work. Under section 12 of the Act every employer must prepare a safety statement which should be based on an identification of hazards and the assessment of the risks in the workplace and which should specify the way in which the safety, health and welfare of employees is to be secured.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which comes under the aegis of my Department, is the statutory body responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and any regulations made under that Act. In response to a large number of calls and queries from members of the public on the subject of workplace bullying, I asked the authority to produce a booklet, &ldquo;Bullying at Work&rdquo;, which offers advice on the subject. I am informed by the authority that callers are made aware of the existence of this booklet and a copy is forwarded to them. An accompanying letter will advise that while the authority does not intervene in an individual case, it will insist that an employer has an anti-bullying policy. The booklet gives details of other sources from which advice or assistance may be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these sources is the rights commissioner service which is based at the Labour Relations Commission at Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. In addition, advice on workplace harassment and discrimination may be sought from the Equality Authority. The Deputy may wish to note that the Employment Equality Act, <Col N="392" /> 1998 prohibits discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. The Equality Authority can advise on the scope or application of this Act. The Equality Authority comes under the control of my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and is based at Clonmel Street, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, which I set up, is examining the area of workplace bullying in detail and is due to report to me very shortly.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the 1982 Restrictive Practices Commission report of inquiry into the statutory restrictions on the provision of dental prostheses which concluded that prohibiting the supply of dentures by non-dentists was a restrictive practice not justified by any advantages it might offer.</P>
      <P>In order to deal with this restriction it is necessary, under the Dentists Act, 1985, for an appropriate scheme to be made by the Dental Council and to be approved by the Minister for Health and Children. I understand that consultations between the Department of Health and Children and the Dental Council relating to the preparation of such a scheme are in progress at present.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the very lengthy period of time which has elapsed since the original RPC inquiry, I hope the matter will be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion in the interests of competition and consumer welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the question put by the Deputy on 23 November last, the issue of whether to proceed with the application, which will have to be accompanied by a new EIS, <Col N="393" /> lies with Dublin Port Company. No such EIS has as yet been submitted to my Department. Should the company produce a new EIS a fresh public consultation period and process will commence.</P>
      <P>The public consultation procedure will be as follows. The Dublin Port Company will be required to publish notice of its proposals in at least two national newspapers. My Department will prepare the notice and specify the newspapers in which it should be published. A development such as this would be subject to the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 to 1999. The public consultation period for an application requiring an EIS is one month and a copy of the EIS must also be provided by the applicant to the consultative bodies named in the Foreshore (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1990, SI 220 of 1990.</P>
      <P>During this one month period the general public would be free to make representations and submissions concerning the proposed infill to me. The port company would then be allowed an opportunity to comment on these before the final report is made to me. That report would detail the proposal, the process that has been gone through, the submissions and commentary on them and recommend whether to grant a permission and, if so, under what conditions.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the event that the company decides to proceed and carry out a further EIS, I expect that it will enter into consultation with local groups as part of the assessment process and that copies of the EIS, when published, will be forwarded to all groups who made objection to the proposal under the public consultation period completed on 1 November 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on 28 January that I intended to put in place new legislation which will see the introduction of mandatory safety training for fishermen in Ireland. I believe the time has now come and that the capacity is now in place to introduce mandatory safety training for the fishing industry. Safety training and the adoption of a strong personal safety culture are vital to protect the lives of fishing crews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed arrangements are in the course of being made by my Department, in consultation with the statutory agencies, to prepare for the introduction of the new measure. Consideration will have to be given to many logistical issues such as: how many fishermen will require training; how will the training be phased and over what period; how will the training be financed; where will the training be given and by whom; what elements <Col N="394" /> need to be covered in the training course; how long the training course will be; how will it be verified that training has taken place and where will the onus lie at the level of the fishing enterprise for ensuring that training requirements are met.</P>
    <P>All these issues will be the subject of consultation with the representative organisations in the fishing industry in due course. The aim is to complete the consultation process by the end of April. The implementation of this initiative is a major undertaking and will take time. I am particularly determined, however, that early progress should be made in respect of basic survival at sea training for new entrants to the fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 23 November 2000 to a similar question raised by the Deputy, there are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the Corrib gas field is that Enterprise Energy Ireland, acting as operator for the development of the Corrib gas field, declared it commercial on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited, and sought a lease from me for its development. This application is being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland have plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expect the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
      <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department, where it is analysed by my Department using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential. However, Enterprise Energy Ireland are reported as saying that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Helvick oil field, the position is that Providence Resources completed an appraisal well on the oil field in the Celtic Sea in September last year. The drilling and test results have been reviewed in detail over the last few months. Although the test results on the well confirmed the good reservoir and oil characteristics seen on the original Helvick oil discovery well in 1983, further detailed analysis has indicated that the Helvick reservoir is much smaller than had been hoped and is highly compartmentalised. <Col N="395" /> Accordingly, Providence Resources has concluded that a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; development of Helvick cannot be justified. Following analysis of the data obtained in 2000 my technical advisers have indicated that Helvick is not commercial.</P>
    <P>Providence Resources has other interests in the Celtic Sea, which include blocks 50/6 and 7, 50/11 and the Ardmore gas prospect. The company has indicated that it remains committed to realising value from its Celtic Sea assets but the fact that Helvick cannot be made commercial has resulted in Providence Resources reviewing its plans for the Celtic Sea as a whole and conducting a strategic appraisal of a number of business development options. My Department is currently in discussion with Providence Resources about restructuring its authorisations in the East Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 21 exploration licences in place covering 106 blocks or part blocks. In addition, eight offshore licensing options and two leases are in place. Applications for a further licensing option <Col N="396" /> and three lease undertakings are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>No exploration wells were drilled offshore Ireland last year.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of and share the concerns of the Irish fishing industry in relation to ensuring its future viability at a time when key commercial fish stocks are increasingly under <Col N="397" /> threat due to heavy exploitation. At the Council of EU Fisheries Ministers in December, against a background of Commission proposals for unjustifiably severe cuts in whitefish quotas, I emphasised the immediate need for radical conservation measures to rebuild and protect whitefish stocks.</P>
      <P>With the full support of our fishing industry, I successfully argued that massive cuts in fish stocks alone were not the answer and must be tempered by a wide-ranging international strategy to protect juvenile and spawning fish stocks through recovery programmes. Each member state must accept its responsibilities in order that conservation and recovery plans are comprehensive and implemented as collective strategic initiatives, focused on the particular needs of each fishery. Ireland has already taken the lead with the Irish sea cod recovery programme. I intend that we will continue to be in the front line when these initiatives, including ongoing negotiations on recovery plans in critical whitefish stocks, are being discussed and formulated.</P>
      <P>The viability of the Irish fishing industry is inextricably linked with the viability of the resource which depends critically on observance of the rules by all member states. I have, therefore, also consistently pressed for enhanced fisheries control measures to be enforced in a strict and even-handed manner right across the EU. I will continue my pursuit of a level playing field in respect of control and enforcement regimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that key commercial fish stocks are heavily exploited and under serious threat. At the recent Council of EU Fisheries Ministers I underlined the urgent need for radical conservation measures to rebuild and protect whitefish stocks.</P>
      <P>With the full support of the Irish fishing industry, I sucessfully argued for comprehensive action to protect juvenile and spawning fish stocks through recovery programmes. Against a background of stark scientific advice, all member states must shoulder their responsibilities and collectively agree these conservation plans. Having taken the lead with the Irish sea cod recovery programme, Ireland will remain at the forefront of these initiatives, including ongoing negotiations on recovery plans in critical whitefish stocks.</P>
      <P>I have also consistently pressed the case for enhanced EU wide fisheries control, enforced in a strict and even-handed manner. The viability of the resource and the interests of the Irish fishing fleet depend on compliance by all member states with the rules.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Marine Institute prepares, on an annual basis, the most comprehensive scientific assessment of the state of fish stocks caught in the waters around Ireland and of fish stocks of interest to the Irish fishing industry. I will arrange for the latest copy of this assessment to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>At the Nice European Council on 7-9 December 2000, the Charter of Fundamental Rights was jointly proclaimed by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission. The content of the charter had already been approved at the informal European Council meeting in Biarritz on 13-14 October. The charter is in the form of a political declaration and draws together the civil, political, economic and social rights set out in various international and other instruments. The charter is not a legally binding instrument and any of the provisions contained therein are not legally justiciable.</P>
      <P>The charter does not form part of the draft Treaty of Nice and the draft treaty has no implications for religious freedom or the position of the Churches.</P>
      <P>The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a range of provisions guaranteeing freedom of religion and practice. Article 10 of the charter states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Article 21 contains a specific provision prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion. In addition Article 22 guarantees that the European Union shall respect, <i>inter alia</i>, religious diversity.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Deputy's continued interest in this issue and fully appreciate the concerns of local residents in Muff, County Donegal that the <Col N="400" /> section of Canning's Lane, which lies in Northern Ireland, has not yet been fully re-opened.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to the Deputy's question on the same issue on 3 October last, the problem of re-opening the road on the Derry side of the Border is the subject of ongoing dialogue between Derry City Council, the Northern Ireland Department of Regional Development and the landowner in question.</P>
      <P>Derry City Council has endeavoured to use a private streets order to adopt the relevant section of Canning's Lane, which I understand is technically a private road. To facilitate this the council is apparently willing to forego its usual practice of requiring the landowner to bring the road up to public standard and has agreed to carry out the improvement works itself. However, the landowner's consent is required and regrettably this has not been forthcoming to date. Nevertheless, I understand that efforts are still being made to resolve the matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will maintain contact with the appropriate Northern Ireland authorities in regard to this matter and will continue to express our interest in having this cross-Border road fully re-opened.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the UNFPA are engaging in a massive campaign of aggressive sterilisation of Peruvian women since 1996; if the Government funds this programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3500/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, extends assistance to developing countries at their request to help them address reproductive health and population issues. UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism. All of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy as laid down by its governing council in 1985 stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allegations concerning coerced sterilizations by the Peruvian authorities led to the formation in August 1997 of an independent investigative commission which included representatives of the women's groups that had reported the abuses. In February 1999, after investigating the charges, the commission, in a statement of consensus, found that reports of a &ldquo;massive and coercive sterilization programme in Peru&rdquo; were erroneous and did not reflect the reality of the programme. The Ministry of Health, in an evaluation requested by the commission, had acknowledged that there were cases of Government abuses relating to pro<Col N="401" /> gramme targets, poor quality of services, insufficient counselling to ensure full information and informed choice, and a lack of patient follow-up. The Ministry, with UNFPA's support, is implementing a series of measures to guarantee principles of free and informed choice and to improve quality of care.</P>
    <P>Far from supporting forced sterilization in Peru, UNFPA has been instrumental in ensuring that it adheres to the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development principles of free and informed consent. Those critical of the UNFPA programme may confuse UNFPA activities with policies or alleged policies pursued by countries such as China and Peru. The assumption sometimes made is that UNFPA, because of its cooperation with government authorities, implicitly endorses the coercive aspects of policies espoused by those authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs can find no evidence to support this argument.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that some half a million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. Ireland Aid has been making annual voluntary contributions to UNFPA since 1993. The money provided by Ireland Aid contributes to UNFPA's efforts, saves the lives of thousands of women each year and helps prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>Ireland has just completed a three year term on the executive board on UNFPA. We assumed our position on foot of the regular rotation of donor representatives. Through its membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and be in a position to closely monitor UNFPA's performance. At a session of UNFPA's executive board in New York in 1999, the UNFPA programme in Peru was raised with Ireland's support. Membership of the boards ensures that we have an opportunity to present our views on the operation and performance of the UN agencies and to raise queries on specific issues.</P>
    <P>The Department has a sufficient body of information available to it from these sources on which to form an accurate assessment of UNFPA's operations. On the basis of that information, and in the light of specific and repeated assurances from UNFPA, I am satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with the principles of voluntarism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the loss of the <i>FV Scarlettt Buccaneer</i> at Howth Harbour in November 1995, the Minister for the Marine ordered a review of the adequacy of search and rescue coverage on the east coast. In June 1996, the final report of the east coast search and rescue review group was published. This review group was chaired by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and comprised, <i>inter alia</i>, representatives of the Department of Defence and the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The final report of the group set out a number of recommendations, including a recommendation that the east coast should have coverage by a 24 hour, multi-engined, medium load carrying marine emergency helicopter and that this helicopter should be based in Dublin. It was further recommended that once a medium load carrying marine emergency helicopter was available at Dublin, consideration could be given to redeploying the Air Corps Dauphin from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, to another location which was to be determined in the course of a review of the availability and deployment of marine SAR facilities generally at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources awarded a contract to Bond Helicopters on 14 November 1997 for the provision of an east coast SAR service with an expected commencement date of 1 July 1998. Parallel to this process work had been ongoing on identifying the alternative location for the Air Corps Dauphin and the Irish Marine Emergency Service &ndash; IMES &ndash; renamed the Irish Coast Guard, in consultation with the Air Corps, carried out an expert assessment of a number of locations in the south-south east region. On 4 December 1997, it was announced that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources had selected Waterford as the appropriate location in the south-south east region. IMES had advised that the casualty potential and consequent assessment, based on <Col N="403" /> analysis of incident statistics, weather, and air traffic control considerations, pointed to Waterford as the ideal SAR base on the south-south east coastline.</P>
    <P>Following this decision, an Air Corps working group, chaired by the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps &ndash; GOC &ndash; and including a representative of the Department of Defence, was established in December 1997 to plan for the introduction of the service, initially by way of an Alouette helicopter during daylight hours only with the service to be upgraded to full 24 hours status using Dauphin craft as early as possible. The terms of reference required the group to establish the level of service which could be provided from Waterford with effect from 1 July 1998 and to identify the requirements in terms of manpower, facilities and equipment required to provide a dedicated 24 hour Dauphin service before 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The working group reported on 20 January 1998 that Waterford Airport could provide ATC and crash rescue services outside published opening hours and that it would be necessary to enter into a detailed lease with the management in respect of areas of the airport to be used by the Air Corps for accommodation in the terminal building as well as hangarage. Pending the provision of living accommodation at the airport it was proposed that the crews be accommodated in Dunmore East, some ten minutes distance by road. The working group established that the SAR service using a daylight only Alouette helicopter could be provided from 1 July 1998. The report concluded that while the Air Corps was not in a position to provide a 24 hour Dauphin based service from 1 December 1998, such a service could be in position by 1 July 1999.</P>
    <P>The SAR service, utilising an Alouette helicopter, commenced on 1 July 1998. Since the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has primary responsibility for SAR and since the Department of Defence-Defence Forces have no strategic requirement for a base at Waterford Airport, that Department undertook to arrange the provision of long-term infrastructural facilities, including crew accommodation and hangarage, with Waterford Airport management to facilitate the deployment of the Dauphin.</P>
    <P>The provision of air traffic control and fire cover after published opening hours was the subject of ongoing discussion and correspondence between the Department of Defence and Waterford Airport management from June 1998. In this regard, the manager of Waterford Airport set out in a letter to the Department on 7 January 1999 that all conditions, with the exception of the rate of pay, in relation to the provision of after hours services had been agreed with his employees. It was stated that the employees had agreed to a roster that would provide a 45 minute standby cover for marine emergencies with a crew of three, one tower and two rescue crew, outside current published opening hours. The one out<Col N="404" /> standing issue at that time was the rate of pay and the manager sought the advice of the Department in this respect in order that he might establish an appropriate rate. Ongoing contact ensued and on 25 June 1999, the Department of Finance sanctioned the public funding necessary to meet the call out allowance being sought by Waterford Airport. This approval was immediately relayed to the manager of Waterford Airport. On 30 June, when contacted by the Department, the manager indicated that, while staff negotiations had not yet been completed, he reiterated earlier assurances to the Department that after hours cover would in any case be provided by Waterford Airport with effect from 1 July 1999. With regard to the non-provision of these services on the night of the ill fated mission, I would refer the Deputy to the air accident investigation unit report on the accident where the matter is dealt with in some detail.</P>
    <P>The air accident investigation report made a number of safety recommendations. Action is being taken to ensure the early implementation of those recommendations. In regard to the establishment of an air safety office within the Air Corps and the commissioning of an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps, the position is that an Air Corps officer of lieutenant colonel rank has been appointed by the GOC Air Corps to carry out the duties of air safety officer. The procedure for the selection of an appropriate agency to undertake an air operations safety audit of the Air Corps as recommended in the AAIU report is under way and it is expected that an appointment will be made at an early date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Gormley regarding the provision of air traffic control, such services normally include flight information, alerting service, air traffic advisory service, air traffic control service, approach control service and aerodrome control service.</P>
    <P>All or some of the above services may be provided at an aerodrome, but it is dependent upon the level of use of the airport and the complexity and nature of the flights operating into and from it. With regard to specific locations from which the Air Corps operates the position is as follows. Twenty-four hour ATC cover is available at Baldonnel. This cover is necessary due to its proximity to the Dublin Airport flight paths. There is no ATC in Finner Camp, County Donegal, due to it not being within the immediate area of a major airport. However, flight information services are provided on a 24 basis from Finner Camp to the pilots and the ATC and Met Éireann at Shannon are accessed for weather information/traffic control as required. The Air Corps Dauphin helicopter SAR service has been temporarily relocated to Sligo Airport from Finner Camp since 9 January 2001, pending the establishment of a crash rescue service at Finner Camp. Sligo Airport has ATC and a crash rescue service in line with the requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority. SAR operations from Waterford Airport are daylight hours only and ATC services are available.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the means test which applies to the grant of allowances to the widows of certain deceased veterans of the War of Independence. Widows of deceased veterans who died while in receipt of a military service pension or a special allowance qualify for a widow's allowance without the application of a means test. Widows of other deceased veterans i.e. those who were never in receipt of a military service pension or a special allowance may also qualify for a widow's allowance, the purpose of which is to supplement the means of widows who may be in needy circumstances. The means test which is applied in such cases is not very severe. For example, the social welfare old age pension is largely disregarded in the assessment and capital is only partially assessed as means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidance notes issued by the Money Laundering Steering Committee recommend that the true name of a person wishing to open a bank account or to become a joint signatory on a bank account should be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes recommend that wherever possible, a current full valid passport should be requested. It is accepted that there are other documents that customers <Col N="408" /> might produce as evidence of their identity and that it is for each credit institution to decide the appropriateness of such documents in the light of other security procedures operated and other information available at account opening. However, because of difficulties experienced by particular social groups it is hoped to issue revised guidance notes shortly to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 implements the EU Money Laundering Directive in Ireland. Section 32 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a financial institution shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. Failure to comply carries penalties of a fine and-or imprisonment for a term of up to five years.</P>
      <P>The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard. Accordingly, in order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Act, guidance notes were issued in April 1995 by the Money Laundering Steering Committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant regulatory authorities.</P>
      <P>These guidance notes recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes state, however, that it may be reasonable to depart from such specific verification procedures in certain circumstances where a person may not be able to provide such documentary evidence. It is a matter for an institution's management to determine the type of alternative evidence that it is prepared to accept in such cases in order to ensure that the institution complies with its legal obligations under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 guidance notes are under review. The issue of customer identification procedures, including the issue of setting out more specific guidance on alternative methods of identification in cases where persons are not in a position to produce a passport/driving licence, is being considered. The objective is to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations under the Act. It is expected that this review process will conclude <Col N="409" /> shortly and revised guidance notes will be issued in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The low income threshold for the health contribution, below which the levy is not payable, is currently £14,560 per annum or £280 per week, as amended by the Social Welfare Act, 2000. The weekly income threshold will remain unchanged at £280. Arising from the change in the tax year to a calendar year basis, the annual threshold will be £10,775 for the 2001 short tax year, that is 74% of the current threshold of £14,560. There are no proposals at present to increase the weekly threshold. I announced in my budget 2001 speech that all those aged 70 years and over will be entitled to a medical card. Under the current rules, medical card holders are not liable for the health levy contribution and there are no plans to change this position.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that it is the responsibility of the employer or pension company to establish whether employees or pensioners are medical card holders or recipients of a social welfare widow/er's pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife's benefit, or a widow/er's pension acquired under the social security legislation of a country covered by EC regulations. Such persons are exempt from payment of the health contribution regardless of the level of weekly or annual income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a health contribution is being deducted from a medical card holder or a recipient of one of the relevant payments listed above, that person should produce documentary evidence of the relevant entitlement to their employer or pension company. Deductions of the health contribution will cease and any amounts deducted in the current tax year will be refunded directly by the employer/pension company to the employee or pensioner. Where deductions of the health contribution have been made incorrectly in respect of earlier tax years, a refund of such contributions may be claimed from the Collector General's office, PRG section, Floor 5, Sarsfield House, Francis Street, Limerick. A refund application should be accompanied by copies of P60s for the years in question along with documentary proof that a medical card is held or that payment of <Col N="410" /> relevant pension was made for the period in respect of which the refund is being claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax relief at the marginal rate may be claimed for certain non-reimbursed medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer, their spouse, dependent children or a dependent relative in respect of whom a taxpayer is entitled to a dependent relative tax allowance. As I announced in my 2001 Budget Statement, taxpayers who are paying medical expenses on behalf of a dependent relative will be entitled to claim medical expenses relief regardless of whether they are in receipt of the dependent relative allowance. Details will be provided in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief dependent children can mean a child who is over the age of 18 years at the commencement of the year of assessment, who is receiving full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment. Currently, the relief cannot be claimed if the child has income in excess of £2,100, although this restriction is being reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill. Relief cannot be claimed for any expenditure which has been or will be reimbursed, that is, through medical insurance or where a compensation payment is made or will be made.</P>
      <P>Most non-routine medical and dental expenses, including such items as the cost of doctors' visits, maintenance or treatment in a hospital, transport by ambulance, specialised dental treatment and certain items prescribed by a doctor, qualify for relief. However, routine dental, ophthalmic and maternity expenses do not qualify. As announced in the budget, the current restriction on routine maternity care is being removed.</P>
      <P>Tax relief may also be claimed by a taxpayer on their own behalf or on behalf of a dependent child who is a student, in respect of qualifying medical expenses which have arisen outside the State. Where qualifying health care is only available outside Ireland, reasonable travelling and accommodation expenses can also be claimed. The first £100 per year of medical expenses incurred in the case of a claim for an individual, or £200 in the case of a claim for two or more persons, is excluded from the relief. Details of the relief are set out in Revenue leaflet IT6, Medical Expenses Relief, and may be accessed on the Revenue website www.Revenue.ie.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there was a delay in updating the social insurance records of the individuals to whom the Deputy refers. The delay arose because the employers in question encountered software difficulties last year with a particular payroll system which they each used. The employers were contacted by Revenue and allowed some time to correct the problem. The relevant information was received in January and is now being processed.</P>

The matter was then discussed in detail at meetings with the Commission and a reply has been sent to the Commission.

      <P>In respect of undergraduate courses in another EU member state, a qualifying course is a course of at least two years duration in a publicly funded university or college. Courses in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry or teacher training are excluded from the relief.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the relief, a qualifying postgraduate course in another EU member state must be of at least one academic year, but not more than four academic years, in duration and must lead to a postgraduate award based on either a thesis or an examination. The person taking the course must already have a primary degree or an equivalent qualification.</P>

Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 and upwards, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of providing care for a psychiatric patient depends on the level of service being provided and on whether the patient is in a hospital or community based setting. The total cost of each local mental health service is set out in the annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing the regulation of the private health insurance industry in this country requires insurers to provide a minimum level of cover under health insurance contracts. Insurers are obliged to provide a minimum benefit which covers the cost of 100 days in-patient care for a psychiatric patient. This minimum benefit is considerably higher than is required in many other countries where a voluntary private health insurance operates.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the cover provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The VHI provides cover for the cost of 180 days in-patient psychiatric treatment. This cover is significantly in excess of the minimum required by law. If a person chooses to avail of a private psychiatric hospital rather than the public health system the State does not provide any funding towards the patients care.</P>
      <P>Nursing home subvention is not payable if the hospital in question is a private psychiatric hospital, registered in accordance with the Mental Treatment Acts. Subvention cannot be availed of as the hospital cannot be registered in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. If the patient were to transfer to another facility, he may qualify for nursing home subvention. This transfer would be subject to the medical care needs of the patient being appropriate to this facility.</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. Section 22 of the regulations set out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000 or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the nursing home regulations <Col N="416" /> including a review of the value of the principal residence for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975. The question of eligibility arrangements for health services generally will be considered in the context of preparing the new health strategy. As part of that process there will be an opportunity for objective analysis of, and full consultation on, any changes that may be proposed.</P>
      <P>People who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the LTI scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of maternity services at these hospitals is, as the Deputies are aware, a matter for the North Eastern Health Board. The board's 1998 framework document for the development of acute hospital services in the region recommended that the maternity services in the region be reviewed. Briefly, the report of the review group indicated that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk must cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services be established in Dundalk and consultant-led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the health board decided not to &ldquo;accept in full the recommendations&rdquo; in the review group's report and it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit, that will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning, as anticipated in the national development plan. It is proposed that the board will finalise plans for this review at the February monthly meeting of the board.</P>
      <P>I am of the firm view the way forward for maternity services is about putting in place services which comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice recommendations. I met the chairman and representatives of the board recently and I emphasised the need to ensure patient and staff safety. I also stated that it is imperative that the board establishes and finalises a clear view on what services will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services requiring to be developed and the enhancement of existing services in the light of the £160 million NDP funding which has been notified to the board. I look forward to receiving the board's proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that the board further considered the question of maternity services at special meetings in January and February. In order to avoid the suspension of maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk, the health board mandated the chief executive officer to seek as a matter of urgency, approval for the appointment of temporary consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath hospital groups to give adequate cover for the continuation of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk and to seek in addition approval for the immediate appointment of onsite paediatric cover at both hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> My Department has recently received a submission from the board in this regard. This submission which includes proposals for five temporary consultant staff is currently being considered by my Department. However, approval of any such posts would ultimately be a matter for Comhairle na nOspideál, which is the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staffs in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts.</P>

The questions raised by the journalist were answered by the board.</P>
      <P>Because of recent concerns regarding the control of herbal medicinal products, and because it is not anticipated that the current discussions at EU level will produce a resolution to these difficulties in the near future, I asked departmental officials, together with the Irish Medicines Board, to investigate the possibility of an interim national system for the licensing of certain herbal or traditionally used medicinal products, thereby putting in place a licensing mechanism for such products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran Report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the dental health action plan to be achieved. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>As part of this initiative, my Department has approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The group has set a target date of 1 April this year for the implementation of the pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment and the maintenance of information on numbers in treatment and waiting lists is the responsibility of the health boards. The most recent information available to my Department from figures received on 23 January 2001 is as follows:</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the IBTS is a matter for its board of management. The service operates in a rapid and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, management and the entire staff of the organisation. The need to continue to meet regulatory requirements and to implement measures to address concerns about the possible risk to patients of infection with variant CJD from blood transfusion will, I expect, impact significantly on the current activities of the service. A partnership approach involving the management and staff is necessary to pursue successfully this agenda for further change.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I provided funding of £695,000 to the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000 to alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period 2000/2001. This investment package included provision for the contracting of private nursing home beds. The contracting of such beds allows for earlier discharge of patients from the acute hospitals for convalescence purposes. Typically, patients who are in need of nursing or convalescence care are placed in a nursing home for a week or two prior to discharge home, thereby freeing up acute hospital beds for more acute medical and surgical admissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has contracted 43 nursing home beds involving 17 nursing homes across their region. This initiative has resulted in the freeing up of approximately 1,000 bed days in the board's acute hospitals for the treatment of additional patients in the region and has therefore helped to alleviate some of the bed management problems that are normally associated with winter medical admissions. I am advised by the Mid-Western Health Board that it has not received any criticism from doctors in their region on this matter and that the initiative has been favourably received by clinicians and other staff <Col N="423" /> on the board as a significant benefit to patient care.</P>

      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas, provides for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. It provides for different legal procedures to be followed with regard to the detention of adults and of children under 18 years. It does not contain any provisions regarding the age for admission to psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>Children aged between 16 and 18 years are currently treated by the adult psychiatric services. The placement of children of this age in adult psychiatric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate. A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development. This group will also examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years, in conjunction with experts from the field of adult psychiatry, to determine how these can best be addressed in the context of future service developments.</P>
      <P>Suicide has become a serious social problem and is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds. This year an additional £830,000 is being provided to health boards for suicide prevention and research. This includes an additional £100,000 for the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork to support its work in the development of a national parasuicide register.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> The Dental Council is largely independent in the exercise of its functions under the Dentists' Act, 1985. There are powers available to me under section 55 of the Act to direct the council to produce a scheme for a particular class of auxiliary dental worker but the content of such a scheme is primarily a matter for it. While such schemes are subject to my consent, I do not have powers of amendment.</P>
    <P>The question of regulating the practice of denturism has been the subject of protracted correspondence between my Department and the Dental Council. In 1993, at the instigation of my Department, the council submitted a draft scheme for a class of auxiliary dental worker, to be known as clinical dental technician. However, this draft scheme did not adequately address the existing situation of technicians engaged in the practice of denturism for a number of years who would have acquired a level of competence in the appropriate clinical and other skills required. With this in mind, my Department asked the council to examine the issue further.</P>

      <P>At present, development on the foreshore, which is outside the functional area of the planning authority, is not subject to normal planning controls. However, Part XV of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides that permission shall be required in respect of development on the foreshore in circumstances where, if the development is carried out, it would adjoin the functional area of the planning authority or any reclaimed land adjoining the functional area of the planning authority. This will apply to all types of development, including reclamation of land, if it is not otherwise exempt in accordance with the Act or regulations made under the Act. The normal processes relating to applications for planning permission under Part III of the Act will apply. A person proposing to develop on the foreshore will continue to be obliged to seek a foreshore licence in accordance with the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997, I have allocated a total of £18 million to this scheme, which to the end of 2000 had allowed some 65,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2001. Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme funding is available towards the once-off costs of obtaining or installing the relevant equipment. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, my Department has no role in setting or abolishing such fees.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department operates the equal opportunities childcare programme and has responsibility for £250 million being provided for childcare under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department has also been allocated by the Government a further £26.5 million as part of an additional £40 million package for childcare. The objectives of this funding are to maintain and increase the number of childcare places available, to improve the quality of childcare provision and to ensure the co-ordination of childcare service provision on a local and national basis.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of December 2000, over the past three years in the Dublin north west constituency, I have approved funding to 13 childcare groups. The total amount committed by my Department to these groups is almost £1.69 million.</P>
      <P>To date under the equal opportunities childcare programme in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, in Dublin north west over 90 new childcare places will be created and the continuance of over 450 existing places will be assured. This funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow childcare providers extend their opening hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department will contact the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee with regard to the difficulties arising in its VTOS programme. The vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) is delivered in <Col N="439" /> each area by the local vocational education committee. The scheme was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months.</P>
      <P>Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses where they reside three miles from the centre and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS. About 5,000 people participate annually on the vocational training opportunities scheme at an annual cost to the State of £32 million, which is partially funded by the European Social Fund. The vocational training opportunities scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment.</P>
      <P>For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more. An annual grant of £15,000 is paid by my Department to vocational education committees in respect of each group of 20 VTOS students. It covers expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The rate of this grant has remained unchanged since 1989.</P>
      <P>However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>A scheme of grants for childcare for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by childcare responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.27 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>While most of the detailed matters referred to in the Deputy's question are discharged by a design team and specifically the design team leader, a school management authority plays a significant role in managing a capital project. The main areas for a school authority in this matter relate to design team selection and appointment, ensuring that each submission emanating from its design team is delivered within a previously agreed timescale and complies with the design team procedures of my Department.</P>
      <P>A management authority can ensure compliance with my Department's design team procedures by frequently meeting with its design team. Such meetings provide an opportunity for a management authority to understand the purpose of a stage and to assess how the emerging plans achieve the overall purpose. Additionally, at such meetings, a management authority can seek confirmation from its design team that the project is within the area limits and cost norms set down at the start of the project. In the case of a project that does not comply with area and/or cost norms, a management authority should request and assess written explanations for non-adherence to the parameters set down.</P>
      <P>A management authority is expected to pay the contractor on foot of moneys disbursed from my Department. Before a building project is handed over to a school management authority, as end user, it is expected that the management authority be satisfied with the building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils at second level operates in secondary schools in the free education scheme, and in vocational, community and comprehensive schools. The terms of the scheme are the same for each category of school.</P>
      <P>A necessitous pupil, for the purposes of the scheme, is defined as a pupil from a family in which genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as alcoholism, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year, schools and vocational education committees furnish to my Department general details of the number of necessitous pupils <Col N="443" /> assisted in the previous year. Based on these returns the grant is paid by my Department to the individual secondary, community and comprehensive schools and to vocational education committees in respect of vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Principal teachers administer the scheme in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the scheme based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. The monetary value of the aid given to necessitous pupils varies. Subject to the terms of the scheme, principals have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and the level of assistance in each case. The means by which such assistance is to be provided by schools to necessitous pupils &ndash; financial assistance, vouchers or provision of books on loan or otherwise &ndash; is a matter for individual school authorities.</P>
    <P>At second level, in 2000, a total of £4,552,000 was allocated in aid towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sensitive, responsive and resourceful manner in which the management and staff of schools, particularly the principals, operate the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The third level student support schemes, administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees under the aegis of my Department, offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one years' duration, pursued in an approved institution.</P>
      <P>Students from this State, who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland, can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses at higher national diploma level or higher, which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of either the higher education grants scheme or the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. Grants are not payable in respect of tuition fees paid at undergraduate level. However, since the introduction, in 1998, of undergraduate tuition fees in Northern Ireland, students from this State can apply to the relevant education and library board for grant assistance towards their undergraduate tuition fees.</P>
      <P>Students pursuing approved postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for assistance under the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme in respect of maintenance grants and grants in respect of the cost of their tuition fees, subject to a maximum fee limit, which is currently £3,064.</P>
      <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation was the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%. The current rate of the higher, non-adjacent maintenance grant is £1,775.</P>
      <P>In relation to income limits, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-2001 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
