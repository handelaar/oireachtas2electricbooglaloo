      <Quest>the number of vacancies for parliamentary counsel and assistant parliamentary counsel in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government; the impact vacancies have on the Government's legislative programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven vacancies for assistant parliamentary counsel at the moment, one at the grade I level and six at grade II level. One of these vacancies already existed and the others are additional posts recently sanctioned. They are to be filled by means of recruitment through the Civil Service Commission and this process is in train.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the vacancies, they do not immediately impact on the Government's legislative programme. The filling of the vacancies will, however, ensure that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will be better equipped to draft Bills, amendments to Bills and statutory instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his comment that the vacancies are not causing a delay in the preparation of legislation? How long will it take to fill the vacancies and what is the exact nature of the work which will be done by the people who will fill the six new posts? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A written exam was held yesterday and interviews will follow. Some 29 applications were received from three barristers and 26 solicitors. The written exam will be corrected over the coming week and interviews will be held thereafter. I expect it will be about a month before the vacancies are filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The positions are being filled to increase the number of staff in the office who will deal with the drafting and processing of legislation. The statute law revision unit is up and running and <Col N="1226" /> the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill is currently before the House. Further proposals have been received in regard to the electronic formatting of statutes and the office is endeavouring to increase its work rate in these new areas. Most of the office's work will still concern what we know as &ldquo;parliamentary draftspersons&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify that there is no written or unwritten rule to the effect that only barristers can work in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel? Did any of the 29 applications come from people working abroad and, if so, will the filling of the vacancies be delayed if any of those applicants are selected?</P>

      <P>For the purposes of accuracy, some 29 applicants were expected to sit yesterday's exams but only 18 turned up.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal profession is particularly busy. Both barristers and solicitors are eligible to apply for these posts. Barristers and solicitors must have practised for four years to take up a grade II position and there is a seven year requirement for the grade I post. It is expected that people appointed to these positions would have first hand experience as practitioners in all aspects of law and would satisfy formal legal requirements. They can be from either sides of the legal profession.</P>

      <P>There are two levels. Assistant parliamentary counsel grade 1 has a salary of £49,237 to £60,721. The salary for assistant parliamentary counsel grade II is £37,878 to £48,676.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he is attempting to mask what is a serious problem in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. While he admitted that the vacancies amounted to six, will he express that in terms of the overall complement in the office? Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that there is a crisis in the parliamentary counsel's office that will impact adversely on our programme of work in the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the previous and current Attorneys General the work output is well ahead of what we have been able to deal with. In recent years, 145 Bills were dealt with and in this session the number is 15 or 17 Bills. It always has been a busy office and because the people who apply for this job have to work in the common law system, the pool from which they come is limited. There are currently 11 permanent staff, one chief parliamentary counsel, three parliamentary counsel, five assistant parliamentary counsel at the grade 1 level and two at the grade II level but there is much other work they wish to do. We have often spoken during Question Time about the electronic formatting of the Statute Book, putting items in chronological order and all of that work. Some of that work has been done but to keep it up to date and to be able to automatically bring into place the chronological tables, the statutes and the index requires staff. The existing staff will be involved in drafting Bills. The order of the office now is that the staff are grouped around ministries and Departments so that they can work on and specialise in those Bills, which is appropriate, but it requires people to do that. That is the reason for the additional staff, only one of which is from the existing complement; the others are new. This will allow us to get on with this work.</P>
      <P>I hope that later this year &ndash; I know I will be asked this question &ndash; the Statute Book from 1922 to 1998 will be updated but it will require a fair amount of technological work to make it available electronically. Once a Bill is passed here it will automatically form part of the chronological statutes and instruments. That will have to be done on contract, which is being examined currently, but it requires extra staff before we can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said there were 11 permanent staff. Are there people already employed on short-term contracts and what age groups would some of those fall into? Is it the case that at least one or two would be well past the normal retirement age? Has any instruction been given to all the Departments to improve and strengthen their own capacity in preparing legislation to ensure there is a sharing of the work in the preparation of legislation? Not all Departments have such expertise and very often the legislation, when it is submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, requires a great deal of work. Would it not also be practical that each Department would improve its legislative preparation sections to ensure legislation is written more quickly and effectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details of the ages of the people. There are two contract drafters and a third drafter will join the office in March. They are from common law jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure, but in the past we used drafters from Canada and Australia. It would be better to have our own. During the past decade the experienced drafters in specialist work have tended to have retired in other jurisdictions. The Deputy asked another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the capacity of Departments to prepare draft legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are continually trying to get them to do this and a number of Departments have succeeded in doing it. As Deputy Owen knows, the length, complexity and urgency of legislation are factors. If the Department had people who could give clear instructions and bring it to a certain stage, it would make it much easier for drafters. We have done this recently in the case of a number of Bills where people have legal expertise. The drafters and Parliamentary Counsel say they still have to check it, but if it is in good draft form it is easier for them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a gap between the Government's laudatory commitment to promoting e-commerce and the failure to up-date in electronic format the legislative enactments which have taken place since 1998? What action is he taking to ensure the capability of the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Attorney General's office and the other areas responsible for legislation are properly maintained? Does he agree it is clear from his replies that the system is not working with the speed or alacrity required? Does he share this concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the Statute Book from 1922 to 1998 &ndash; we want to keep it up to date &ndash; is available in electronic format. However, the statutes for the past two years are not. Some decisions were taken during the lifetime of this Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am not taking from it. The then Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, was the person who started it and I do not want to take from the man's good work in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals are being considered as part of the wider project under which the statutes will be automatically available in electronic format once they are enacted. This was not done under the original project and additional staff are required to do it. It is also proposed that the chronological tables of statutes and statutory instruments will also be available in electronic format. I accept this is not the case now but the project is under way and hopefully it will be completed this year <Col N="1229" /> and once a Bill is enacted it will be automatically available in electronic format.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>When the Government came into office, the Minister for Finance laid down certain rules governing the salaries of special advisers. Their terms and conditions of employment had already been laid down under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, but the legislation made no reference to salaries.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to introduce a degree of regulation on the question of salaries because of our concern about the cost to the taxpayer of advisers' salaries. The Minister for Finance established an attraction allowance of 10% on top of the previous salaries of appointees. The offices of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are excluded from these regulations and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were given authority to sanction the appointments and salaries of advisers in these Departments. In my appointment of advisers I have, with some exceptions, kept the increase on their previous remuneration packages to approximately 10%. In the case of the most recent appointment of a political adviser to my office the increase is in the region of 16%.</P>
      <P>The salaries of advisers in my office are largely based on salaries of previous incumbents in the office. They are, in the main, related to Civil Service salary scales and on appointment the minimum salary applicable is the minimum of the assistant principal, general service grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that on 5 December 2000 he categorically stated in this House that in respect of the appointment of a political adviser he was confined to 10% over and above the existing salary and he indicated to the House that a contract had not at that stage been signed? Is the Taoiseach confirming that he breached that 10% in the case of a political adviser? On what basis would that 10% have been paid? Is it based on the adviser's previous salary? The Taoiseach is giving different information now than he gave in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1230" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Taoiseach is not covered by that rule. A number of people in my office got increases of 7% or 8%. The exact percentage received by the most recent appointee to my office was 16.24%. When I last spoke about this the figures had not been negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> What is the justification for exempting the Offices of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste from the 10% rule laid down by the Minister for Finance? Does the Taoiseach agree that in the context of the special adviser's increase of 16% on an already generous wage, the Government is guilty of the most monumental double standards? Likewise, in respect of the announcement made in the dead of night last week of huge increases for Ministers, Oireachtas Members and top civil servants, how does the Taoiseach justify the Government's intervention in and excoriation of secondary teachers' pay claim when he is doing exactly what he criticises the teachers for? What are the criteria for the pay scales of special advisers to the Government? Are there special criteria? Is there benchmarking? How is their performance judged? In comparison with a Dublin Bus driver, who has 50 people in his care at rush hour and has enormous responsibilities&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am trying to get to the bottom of this curious question of how the Taoiseach can award somebody very high wages for being his adviser while other workers are hammered down to the terms of pay agreements worked out between the Government, employers and trade unions. On what basis are exceptions made for some while other workers who carry big responsibilities are hammered down to less than £20,000 a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Deputy has worked out, in relation to his own salary increase of 18.7%, which was worked out under a benchmarking process, that the conclusion arrived at is that he is worth 18.7%. I am sure he is worth that.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the generality of the question, the Deputy is well aware of grade structures, whether worked out under conciliation schemes, arbitration schemes or benchmarking schemes. The substance of this question does not apply to advisers. The salaries of special advisers are based on a figure which has not always existed but which has been in existence for some time. People who leave their jobs are, in many cases, unable to return to those jobs in the same circumstances. They take on different tasks, work different hours and must operate regardless of who is in Government, and they must be totally flexible. That is why they get an additional increase. They are not paid overtime, as are bus drivers or other <Col N="1231" /> such workers who very much deserve it. Because of that, the flexibility, the uncertainties and sometimes the short duration involved, they can be paid those increases. There is no more motivation than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware he said in December there are fixed guidelines within the Department of Finance, which fixes a percentage? I am seeking to clarify the position. Did the Department of Finance give the Taoiseach specific approval to give one adviser a 16.24% increase? What impact does he consider that will have on his other advisers who were limited perhaps to an additional 10% increase on their previous salary? Does he anticipate a rush in demand by other people for increases in their pay packets?</P>
      <P>Are the salaries of the Taoiseach's political advisers and other advisers part of a benchmarking process? Perhaps he will share with the House how benchmarking in respect of a political adviser's salary works? Does it work on the basis of advice, bad publicity or good spinning? I do not want to be personal about any adviser. In general, how are the salaries of political advisers benchmarked? Having set the benchmark, how are their salaries increased?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be saying that his political advisers get a package deal, that if there are five or six people whose salaries cannot go above an additional 10% of their previous salaries, those salaries are added together and divided by five and if one person gets only an additional 7% increase another person can get the extra amount. That position needs to be clarified for the sake of anyone who might get a job in his office and who would want to know where he or she stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as helpful as I can. I know the Deputy was listening to me but she may not have heard me correctly. I said that the Minister for Finance established an attraction allowance of 10% on top of the previous salaries of appointees. The Offices of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are excluded from these regulations and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were given authority to sanction the appointments and salaries of advisers in these Departments. Therefore, I was not curtailed to that particular figure. In answering questions on the last day, if could have been read that I was curtailed to that figure. I thought I was, but I was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach wrongly briefed on 5 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was asked a question by Deputy Howlin and I read the text of what I said to him. I had not checked what salaries those people were on. I was not involved in the negotiation of their contracts. There is no benchmarking process for advisers. There could not be one, as advisers are in office for the term of a <Col N="1232" /> Government and they leave office when that Government leaves office. Looking back over the years, the figures involved range from 5% to 25%, which are quite different. Looking back on the files, the starting point is the salary the person concerned was on. Nobody received a reduction on taking up a job as adviser&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach: -</NameTxt>
      <P>under any Administration. Some of them received an increase of 5%, 6% or 7%. What is taken into account is the type of post and the opportunities the person concerned is giving up. That was taken into account in a number of these posts over the years. I hope that fully answers the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that as a result of the reply he gave in December, he caused a stir in the former place of employment of his newest appointee at that time in the sense that a calculation was being made as to what the salary must have been if there was a 10% increase, if the salary of £70,000 included a 10% increase? That information can be transmitted to the former colleagues of that person so that RTE does not get a huge demand for an additional 16% increase in salary from its staff who are on the same level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

There was an increase at that stage but the others would be in that range.</P>

      <P>The process of filling the post of executive chairperson of the NCPP is currently <Col N="1233" /> under way.

      <P>Why has it taken so long to make this appointment? Is the Taoiseach not concerned, given the serious labour unrest, including an Aer Lingus strike threatened tomorrow and other industrial actions taken in the last year, that the most important matter of economic policy for the country is to ensure the viability of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness? Why has it has taken so long to fill this post?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Owen said, this is an important post. There were discussions between the Government, IBEC and ICTU about how this post should operate and its relationship with NESC and NESF. There is a parliamentary question to be dealt with later concerning legislation related to this issue which is due this year.</P>
      <P>The discussions about how this would work and the report on the NCPP were completed from Partnership 2000 and that was also taken into account in framing the type of post this should be. There was not a delay as such given that this was put down as a concept during the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, but how the social partners would make the NCPP operate had to be worked out. The work of this organisation will be vitally important, as it will move on the excellent work of its forerunner, the National Centre for Partnership. There is also another position to be filled, but this position should be filled in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that this centre will be embraced by the legislation that will put the NESC and NESF on a statutory basis? That legislation has been promised for some time. What is the delay? In replying to a parliamentary question on 23 May 2000 the Taoiseach said he expected it to be published this year but the legislation is not on the list of published legislation which the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, circulated. I am aware of the intense negotiations taking place about this and of the uncertainty even about the location of the centre. What is the problem and why has it taken the Government more than three years to do a fairly straightforward and simple exercise? Are we back to the substance of the first question regarding the legislative chaos in the Taoiseach's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation concerning the NESC and NESF was ready at the time of the negotiations, in autumn 1999. The social partners and the Government stated that we should also include the NCPP in the legislation and there were discussions last year about the staffing of the NCPP, its work, role and core structures. <Col N="1234" /> When that was completed it was returned to the chief parliamentary counsel. At Christmas counsel submitted a Bill which included the NCPP with the two other organisations. We should soon be ready to proceed with the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, it is legislation that can be brought forward. Nothing has been lost by a delay. I could have proceeded with legislation on the NESF and the NESC last summer or autumn but it was better not to do so without the NCPP because they all compose the new Office for Economic and Social Development. We will bring forward the legislation soon which establishes the office incorporating the NCPP, the NESC and the NESF.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is considering a number of possibilities in relation to referenda during 2001. Among matters being considered are the Nice Treaty and the International Criminal Court. The question of whether ratification of the Treaty of Nice will require a referendum is still under consideration. The Government will take a decision when the formal text of the Nice Treaty has been <Col N="1235" /> finalised by EU legal experts and when the advice of the Attorney General has been received. I hope and expect that we will soon be in a position to take that decision. However, I have asked officials to ensure that the preparatory work necessary for a referendum is put in train so as to give the Government the full range of options as to timing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the International Criminal Court, the Attorney General has advised that for Ireland to ratify the statute, a constitutional referendum is required. The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that the Bill is currently being drafted and it is hoped to have it published at an early date. A date for a referendum has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>The Government will decide in due course on the specific package of measures which shall be put to referenda this year and on the timing of these referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that we are confined to the Nice Treaty and the International Criminal Court? He gave a commitment that there would be a referendum on abortion during the lifetime of the Government. What became of that? I understood that a commitment had been given on the necessity to amend the Constitution on the impeachment of judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not take it that these are all the changes that are proposed. I gave a commitment to the House on abortion and related legislation. This ought to be treated as a discrete item. The report of the all-party committee has made a valuable contribution to the debate and is before the Cabinet committee. We will not move on this issue until the Government can frame an amendment with legislation. I am not interested in a referendum for its own sake or one that will create division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet committee is still working on the matter. The consideration is how many items we can put in a referendum. There is the Nice Treaty, the International Criminal Court at the Hague and the all-party committee report on the judicial council which has long been finished. Last week we received Mrs. Justice Susan Denham's report, the short version of which I had the opportunity to read over the weekend. It will be implemented soon. There are some differences between the conclusions and those just expressed, particularly in the make-up of the judicial council. The concepts, however, are similar. The matter is important and we should deal with it. Four reports have been circulated to the Departments and analysed. Some other issues could also be dealt with. We will have to decide how many items can be put. There are three definite items <Col N="1236" /> and two or three others which have been listed as priorities. It is possible that four or five items will be put in the referendum. We have yet to make a decision on that.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to make progress. There must be a referendum and we will take a number of the issues, particularly the three mentioned &ndash; the Nice Treaty, the International Criminal Court and the judicial council. One or two other items according to priority as specified by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Lenihan may also be added.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday at the function in the Berkeley Court Hotel to honour the Irish commissioner as winner of the European Person of the Year award the Taoiseach made it very clear that there would be a referendum or plebiscite. The clear implication was that there would be a democratic vote by the people early in the summer. That is what I and those at the table with me heard. Can we have clarity on this matter? We all want to ratify the international criminal court. That requires a referendum. The other matter requires at least a plebiscite and possibly a referendum, if the legal advice is to that effect. The probability is that it does not require a referendum, having regard to the legal interpretation in other jurisdictions. Will the Taoiseach indicate now that we will have a referendum or plebiscite on two issues in the middle of May? One issue is the ratification of our obligations regarding the international criminal court and the other is the issue of the enlargement of the European Union. The Irish people can then express the point of view so eloquently expressed by the Taoiseach yesterday. Why all the shilly shallying and the equivocation? Why do we not just announce it and bring forward the legislation to make it happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple reason for that is I do not have the treaty. The treaty has to come in all versions, including the Irish language. Then it has to be put on the Cabinet table with the Attorney General's views. The Deputy's criticism would be justified if I made a decision without having a copy of the treaty. It is my view that the enlargement process is sufficiently important to be supported by the public. The formal decision must, however, go through normal Cabinet procedures. There is no shilly shallying. I cannot make a decision on a treaty that I do not have. It has not gone through the jurist or linguist group. It has not gone finally through the Commission or the Parliament. I do not even have a draft copy other than the one I brought back on 11 December. That is why I cannot give a definite answer.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree it is highly unsatisfactory that, two months after the Nice summit, a decision still has not been made? Does the Taoiseach not know what he agreed to at Nice? Will he and his advisers, who, as we heard earlier, are well paid, state that the matters agreed between the leaders are of such substance, particularly the progress of the militarisation of the EU and the creation of an EU army which was pushed forward at the summit, that they must be put before the people? On that basis alone, does the Taoiseach agree a referendum is necessary?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state, in the event of it being necessary, the date on which such a referendum would take place? Will he give a commitment, in the event of a general election being held in May or June &ndash; or whenever it takes place &ndash; that a referendum on the Nice summit will not take place on the same day?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not worry because that aspect will not arise. However, the Deputy's point shows why there is a need for the final text of the treaty because, unfortunately, he does not have the foggiest notion about what was agreed at Nice. The concept of a European army was ruled out a long time ago. There will be no European army under the Nice Treaty or any other measure.</P>

I was also a member of the reflection group and I was previously the Minister with responsibility for European affairs. I am probably one of the most pro-European Members of the House. However, I share the concerns of Deputy Higgins. Important issues in the Nice Treaty need to be debated in the House. Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that there will be a debate in the House, rather than in a committee, at an early date on the legislation or referendum he proposes? This will give Members an opportunity to express those concerns. Even those of us who are strongly pro-Europe feel certain issues need to be raised and debated.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept he has failed to achieve all-party consensus on the issue of a referendum on abortion? It increasingly appears that the Fianna Fáil Party is being driven by some Independents to pursue the aim of holding a constitutional referendum on abortion. Will the Taoiseach outline when he expects to hold this referendum because there is only a limited amount of time left?

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>The recent ESRI report &ldquo;Investing in People&rdquo; examined the labour market impact of human resource interventions funded under the Human Resources Operational Programme, 1994-99. That analysis included 14 temporary employment and training programmes. Five of the 14 programmes were found to have significantly increased the employment chances of their participants, while seven programmes were considered not to have displayed positive impacts.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that participation in labour market activation programmes such as community employment, which is the largest of these programmes, is unlikely in itself to significantly improve the job prospects of participants, particularly men, unless it is followed by progression to effective schemes which improve employment prospects.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, commonly referred to as ALMPs. In this regard, the findings in this report and in other reviews already carried out into ALMPs will be taken into consideration as part of this overall appraisal process. The ALMPs review will be undertaken later this year under the auspices of the PPF standing committee on the labour market, which includes representatives from the social partners, FÁS and Departments.</P>
      <P>I have no plans in the short-term to further amend the criteria pertaining to participation on either the CE scheme or the jobs initiative programme.</P>
      <P>The general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the light of both the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure this programme, and the recommendations contained in the subsequent Partnership 2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. The jobs initiative programme was also restructured during 2000, following the consultancy review of the programme.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her response. In light of the criticism of the CE scheme and the other schemes, is she prepared to review the mechanisms involved in the CE scheme to introduce an element of education and specific training? Would she agree that at present the CE scheme is by far the most attractive scheme to get the long-term unemployed back into some sort of training structure and that she should tie an education element into it? Would she also agree that many of the long-term unemployed are not availing of any education, training or employment support services, as has been highlighted in a recent survey in County Westmeath?</P>

      <P>There are a number of different programmes. One of the things we are trying to do, which is something the employment action plan is all about, is offer unemployed persons, particularly those who are unemployed for a considerable length of time in excess of a year, training or other opportunities and the prospect of returning to education. As everybody in the House will be aware, the jobs being created in the economy require a minimum level of skill. In many cases a reasonably high skill level is necessary in order to access even some of the most basic jobs.</P>
      <P>Community employment served a useful purpose when there were high levels of unemployment in the economy. Today it serves more the needs of voluntary and community activity than of labour. That is why it is important, as we restructure CE, that we put alternatives in place. I said in this House on a previous occasion regarding the CE participants who are involved in education, for example, working as secretaries, teaching assistants, caretakers, etc., that it is important that that be mainstreamed and taken over by the Department of Education and Science, and discussions are fairly advanced in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am discussing with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, new proposals aimed at implementing the McDowell report on the single regulatory authority in a manner that ensures there is no loss of synergy between monetary policy and banking supervision. We intend to bring these proposals to Government in the next few weeks.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that damage is being done to the financial services sector arising from the uncertainty from this long-running and apparently interminable dispute between herself and the Minister for Finance? Does she agree that, as far as the sector is concerned, it is more a matter of seeking a decision and certainty about where the financial regulator should repose? When will this legislation be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is regrettable that the making of a decision has taken so long but, as I said before in the House, it is better to make the right decision &ndash; we only have one opportunity to get this right &ndash; than to make a rushed decision. I accept that, since it is almost two years since the report was published &ndash; it will be two years this summer &ndash; it is longer than anyone would have wished.</P>
      <P>However, I can say there is some white smoke and there is light at the end of the tunnel. I expect the legislation to be published either before or during the summer of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the white smoke does not cloud the end of the tunnel. Does the Minister accept the stature of the Central Bank is being undermined by the current controversy? Is it not likely that one of the twin pillars will be dominant over the other and that the apparent compromise emerging will be no clearer than what we have at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. It is fair to say that the twin pillar approach is the one being advanced, without speaking in advance of a Government decision. The solution may lie in the Forfás model <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IDA and Enterprise Ireland which has worked very well. No one could say Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are not separate organisations acting separately with their own boards and chief executives. However, there is co-ordination on policy which is done by Forfás. A decision along the lines of that type of model may well be where the solution lies.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the role of the Central Bank is being undermined. I am sure everyone understands the need for change and to ensure, especially in the context of this economy and what has happened within it, that we have the most effective system of regulating the financial services sector. Although it is a sector which cannot be exclusively regulated domestically given what is happening in the sector and the way it will change fundamentally in the years ahead, we have a duty to ensure within our jurisdiction that we have an effective regime as far as consumers and the public are concerned. We will have something very new and dynamic when the legislation is published later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no one could accept that. The Governor of the Central Bank clearly has an important role to play as Governor of the Central Bank, but it is equally important that there is a strong chief executive of any regulatory body that is established. However, since the decision of Government is awaited in this area, we must await the outcome of those discussions. Certainly it is important that the regulatory body is independent of the Central Bank as we know it and that it has its own board and management system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Many people who have examined this issue have come to the conclusion that the regulation of financial services should be done by a single body and that it is not satisfactory that, at present, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has regulatory functions concerning insurance and friendly societies and so on and that the Department of Finance, through the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, has other regulatory functions in this area. Everyone believes that, to get the best expertise and the most efficient and effective regulation, that must be brought together. It must have a strong consumer focus separate from any functions the Director of Consumer Affairs might have concerning a broad range of issues. This is exclusively a consumer focus concerning financial services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>A fundamental tenet of my Department's approach to employment rights is that the statutory rights and entitlements of all who work in Ireland will continue to be assured and enforced and that effective mechanisms by which they can vindicate their legal rights will be provided. This principle holds good for all workers, irrespective of their nationality, and it lies at the heart of my Department's policy and approach in regard to the enforcement of employment rights in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I unreservedly condemn any abuses of such statutory employment rights and protections to which immigrant workers may have been <Col N="1245" /> subjected by a number of unscrupulous Irish employers and employment agencies. These abuses typically involve the reneging on the pay terms and other working conditions offered to an immigrant worker before departure from his or her home country and his or her subjection while in employment in Ireland to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, for example, excessive accommodation fees, and non-payment of overtime, Sunday, holiday or public holiday pay among other things. My labour inspectorate, in conducting its enforcement responsibilities under labour legislation, operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>
    <P>With a view to regularising any abusive treatment of immigrant workers already in employment here and to stamping out the practice of switching employment contract terms, that is, as between that offered before the immigrant worker leaves his or her home country and that presented on arrival in Ireland, my Department is taking a number of specific initiatives as follows: administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries is being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland; a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act of 1971 is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business; the administrative procedures are being examined to better protect employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned; the labour inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The labour inspectorate is engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel or catering sector staff, and relevant employers and employment agencies are being pursued in this process with a view to prosecutions; and it is intended that, as soon as is practicable, applications for work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very extensive answer from the Minister of State. Does he agree the only way employers and employment agencies will change their ways is if investigations are conducted and prosecutions take place? Is the Minister of State aware of media reports that eastern Europeans are being paid less than the minimum wage in a company in the midlands, that a Filipino national was threatened with deportation because she worked a day and night shift for 18 <Col N="1246" /> hours without any meal breaks and that six nurses coming here had their contracts changed on arrival? Has the Minister of State's Department initiated investigations into these and what progress has taken place?</P>
      <P>A report of greater concern in the same media article was of an Irish-based agent who is an employee of a semi-State company and who charges a 10% fee on individual Romanian salaries. Sixty are under such a contract. Is the Minister of State aware of this and what investigations are taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am aware of many of the issues to which he referred and my Department is actively involved in investigating many of these claims. I am concerned about the type of information emerging because I am sure all in the Chamber agree that immigrant workers are needed for our economy to remain competitive. That said, we also need a just and humane immigration policy, a humanitarian approach to the type of issues raised and to ensure employment rights for all workers. We have statements from workers, employers and agencies. The Deputy mentioned particular sectors in which there are problems. Files are being prepared for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. If there are breaches of legislation, there will be prosecutions, but, having looked at this area, the key is the establishment of a link between agencies and employers here and agencies in the countries of origin of foreign workers. It is a new area for us to deal with, but we have to stamp out abuses and we are determined to do so. There are two other specific areas with which we are dealing across a wide range of possibilities.</P>

The examinations of Kentford Securities Limited and Celtic Helicopters Limited are at an advanced stage and I expect to receive final reports on these companies in the coming months. The examinations of Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and College Trustees Limited are continuing.</P>
      <P>In its judgment of 28 July 2000 the High Court quashed the section 19 appointments to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. Considerable issues of law have arisen from that decision. An appeal has been lodged to the Supreme Court and will be heard on 2 July 2001.</P>
      <P>A further six investigations have been completed to date, namely, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, under section 59 of the Insurance Acts; Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990; Garuda Limited, t/a Streamline Enterprises; Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited; Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited; and Faxhill Homes Limited &ndash; the latter four under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc; Garuda Limited, t/a Streamline Enterprises, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. Consultations with my legal advisers are ongoing regarding the initiation of summary prosecutions for breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine summonses have been issued against Faxhill Homes Limited and its directors in respect of breaches of the Companies Acts. The case is being heard in Naas District Court.

The inspectors are operating to the mandate of the High Court and will make reports to the court in due course. I expect it will be at least six months before this inquiry is completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number may be completed around the same time as they are interconnected. I assume, therefore, that the authorised officer will not be in a position to finally complete any one of them until all the information at his disposal has been fully investigated. A small team is involved in these investigations which, from the taxpayer's point of view, are relatively inexpensive. There has, however, been enormous litigation, some of which has found its way into the public domain. Notwithstanding this, Mr. Gerard Ryan, in the main, and his team have done an outstanding job.</P>
      <P>I expect a number of the outstanding inquiries to be completed by the summer of this year. I understand the report on the inquiries into National Irish Bank &ndash; the inspectors will report to the High Court &ndash; is imminent and may be delivered very soon. The procedure in relation to a section 8 inquiry is that a draft report is sent to those affected to give them an opportunity to respond. In the interests of natural justice, this is necessary, although it does delay somewhat the conclusion of a report. Notwithstanding this, the inquiries into National Irish Bank will be completed shortly and a report submitted to the court.</P>
      <P>Because of the volume of work, I increased the number of inspectors involved in the inquiries into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited by one after Mr. Justice Costello had to stand down on health grounds. He was replaced by Mr. Justice O'Leary and Mr. Michael Cush, senior counsel. The additional inspector will greatly assist in bringing that investigation to an early conclusion. Again, it will not be a matter for me. They are officers of the High Court and will report to it, either on an interim basis or by way of a final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the remaining inquiries with Mr. Gerard Ryan in the Department will be completed very soon. As I said on Committee Stage of the Company Law Enforcement Bill, it is my intention to <Col N="1249" /> introduce transitional arrangements to allow him to conclude the reports as he is not moving to the new office. It would be inefficient to begin the process all over again or hand it over to a new officer. It is right that he should conclude the reports. He is literally working every hour, including weekends and late nights, to try to bring the work to an early conclusion.</P>

A large number of people are involved in many of these inquiries, which take a lot longer than might otherwise be the case, but the reports are all the stronger and professional for this.

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> when she will bring to Government proposals to address the issue of car insurance for young drivers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority Road Accident Facts Report, 1999, showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite. It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the primary focus of initiatives <Col N="1250" /> aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing these costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group established to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of the group's second report, it is hoped to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process. It is also intended to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of ensuring the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It appears that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all EU member states, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State raised the issue of competition. Has increased competition led to cherry picking within the market, which has not benefited young drivers? Is he aware it costs more to do the driving lessons under the IIF discount scheme? A person is £50 worse off and perhaps the Minister of State should review that. When will the recommendations to Government be made? Does the Minister of State recall that three and a half years ago when he and his colleagues were in Opposition they made this a political issue? They have done absolutely nothing about it since they entered Government. When will there be action? Ireland has the worst road fatality statistics in Europe. Action is needed now, not talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten has done a great deal of talking about this issue and I listened with interest to his comments. He said the cost of driving lessons has been driven up as a result of our polices. However, I read about his policy docu<Col N="1251" /> ment in the newspapers and he believed that driving lessons should be compulsory. That would inflate the price of lessons and, perhaps, make them more costly than some insurance charges.</P>
      <P>We expect to have the personal injuries tribunal report and the proposals therein before Government within a month or so. With regard to us having done nothing, we established the Motor Insurance Advisory board, which comprises 17 representatives of every body associated with motoring in Ireland, including all State Departments and agencies involved. It is a powerful board with an excellent chairperson and a tremendous back up secretariat from the Department. The board has been given a task to complete within a set period and will report towards the end of the year. Its report will be worth waiting for.</P>
      <P>We have considered everything over the past three and a half years to address the serious insurance cost issue from both a technical and a legislative perspective. We have received the utmost co-operation from other Government Departments and the relevant measures that can practically be introduced into law will be brought in as quickly as possible, I hope, this year. I hope the Deputy will be pleased when a number of new measures come on stream.</P>

      <P>I am on record as deploring the irresponsible manner in which some publicans are behaving following the expiry of the drink prices order. I am closely monitoring the situation, and I will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the light of developments. As regards the number of inspections of licensed premises, I have been informed by the Director of Consumer Affairs that a total of 2,671 premises was visited to establish compliance with the order and follow-up visits were made to 543 premises. During December 2000 and January 2001, five premises were successfully prosecuted for breaches of the order. Further prosecutions are planned during 2001 in respect of breaches which occurred while the order was in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Two options are being considered by me and my ministerial colleagues. They are the reintroduction of a prices order and the further liberalisation of licensing. I have stated my preference for the latter. All the information we seek is not available and it would be prudent of us to make decisions when we have such information. The prices order I introduced was comprehensive as it related to 13 different drinks, including soft drinks. It was much more comprehensive than the Deputy's, which was a botched effort covering half the country and which was introduced prior to an election. We acted because of the rate of inflation last January and I also introduced a prices display order which has improved the position of consumers who at least <Col N="1253" /> can make a proper choice. The introduction of the prices order has been helpful. However, the introduction of such an order is a blunt instrument nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept the difference between our prices orders was that mine required the price increases to be rolled back and was effective outside Dublin while there was voluntary agreement to roll back prices in Dublin? Is it not the case that he made the prices order prior to the Tipperary South by-election, after a price increase had been imposed? Why is he fluttering his wings making statements when the vintners know well, unless we are on course for an election in the next few months, that the Minister of State has no intention of doing anything?</P>

      <P>It might be possible to hold an inquiry. However, the prices display order was also important. In response to the Deputy's question, I need additional information. The Director of Consumer Affairs has done useful work with regard to the figures. The picture in rural Ireland is much better than in Dublin. The position in Dublin, from initial reports, is not healthy in certain more fashionable parts of the city. I urge consumers to vote with their feet but I assure the Deputy that when I have compiled all the relevant information, I intend to take action.</P>

      <P>There is concern about the present sale of licences, particularly in rural areas, where villages are being denuded of what was formerly a form of community centre where people met for a drink and a chat.

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The performance of manufacturing industry, like that of the economy in general, continues to be strong, as it has been in recent years. Permanent jobs in internationally trading companies which are clients of the development agencies IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and na Gaeltachta have increased by 27% in the four years 1997 to 2000; the increase for 2000 over 1999 was 8%. The total number of jobs in this category at the end of 2000 was 316,000 compared to 215,000 in 1991.</P>
      <P>Underlying this national picture there have similarly been increases in employment in each of the eight regions. While the Government is pleased with this performance, we are determined to continue to focus on carrying through policies which will facilitate continued strong performance in industrial employment and in the economy in general. These policies for the period 2000 to 2006 are set out in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position relative to other countries, as shown in the most recent global competitiveness <Col N="1256" /> report, has now reached seventh in the world compared to 26th in 1996. A central element of our success in this regard in recent years has been the ongoing partnership approach. We will continue to use this approach to focus on factors such as the skills level of the population, the quality of our physical infrastructure, the costs facing business, the services needed by business, the regulatory environment and the effectiveness of public administration.</P>
    <P>There will always be threats and challenges to be faced and we must continue to compete actively in the global marketplace. While I am concerned at any factors that might adversely affect industrial employment, there is no evidence available to my Department or the industrial development agencies of any increased tendency for firms to relocate to low-wage economies. It is not possible to determine the number of enterprises or sections of enterprises which have relocated to other economies in the past 12 months as statistics are not maintained in this format. The reasons for relocation are many and varied, and Ireland has on balance benefited from such movement in recent times due to the strength of our economy.</P>
    <P>The job losses which are occurring are mainly as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities and, hence, jobs at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in the Irish context. The IDA's policy in this regard is, first, to focus a major part of its efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas owned companies in this country. It also seeks to ensure that, as jobs are lost at the lower end of the scale, they are more than compensated for by a greater numbers of jobs at the higher end. This process has been more than successful over the past decade and would not have occurred without the continued active promotion of Ireland as an investment location against competition from other destinations for foreign investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply the Tánaiste indicated that the majority of relocated jobs are low-paid or low-technology ones. Will she confirm whether Motorola's proposed relocation comes within either category? Will she also outline the various other locations throughout the country which, in the past six months, have lost heavily to international competition? There seems to be no response on her part, or on the part of the Government, to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, industries &ndash; not Governments &ndash; create jobs. As the Deputy is aware, unemployment in this economy is now down to 3.6%, and long-term unemployment is down to 1.5%. Ireland continues to do extremely well from foreign direct investment. We win about 27% of all mobile investment coming from the US into Europe, even though we have less than 1% of the European Union's population. <Col N="1257" /> Motorola is restructuring its operation world-wide. It has not done well <i>vis-à-vis</i> its competitors in relation to the manufacture and sale of mobile phones. That is what the company was engaged in here. It is fair to say, however, that the people losing their jobs in Motorola are being actively headhunted by other companies. There is no question about that and I doubt if there will be anybody who will not be able to find a job with other companies, if that is his or her wish. We need to emphasise that investment is mobile and will only come here and stay for as long as it is competitive to do so. Wage levels are important but so too are infrastructure, the level of education, the rate of tax that applies to the economy, and the state of our telecommunications network. Because we have made major changes in those areas we remain very attractive for investment, but we will always lose some industries when they become uncompetitive.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for the work that Enterprise Ireland is doing in providing assistance and advice for small and medium sized textile industries in Donegal. Does she accept, however, that Donegal still has a huge problem following the loss of the Fruit of the Loom plants? That matter remains to be addressed both in relation to stabilising the remaining manufacturing industries and addressing the need for alternative industries to ease the repercussions of the loss of that company to a third world market.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste confirm whether Enterprise Ireland or any other State body is giving aid to help companies set up or relocate overseas, as has been mooted by some individuals currently involved in manufacturing? Will the Tánaiste also comment on the IDA's figures for job creation in the Donegal area?

      <P>It is not true that we pay companies through either Enterprise Ireland or the IDA to take jobs abroad. It may make sense for some companies to move manufacturing jobs abroad and increase the redesign or marketing element or the research and development element of their operation in Ireland. If that kind of restructuring was under way with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of a company or ensuring that it survives, then obviously restructuring moneys may be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fruit of the Loom is a case in point and this probably gives rise to Deputy Durkan's question. That was very basic manufacturing. The salary levels in Morocco are about one seventh of what they were in Ireland and, therefore, the company was not able to compete from an Irish location. Donegal has experienced a severe loss. It is probably one of the reasons we should never put such a huge concentration into such a relatively small area in the future. Virtually all of Inishowen and <Col N="1258" /> Buncrana, in particular, was very dependent on a single company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that the Tánaiste's advice from the agencies is that there is no trend towards relocation to low cost economies? It seems to me that the IDA, for example, which is a very professional organisation, is caught in the old paradigm and will not concede anything. Surely, what we have seen in Tullamore and in Ballina, where I met the workers in Henniges last Saturday week, are examples, several of which we have around the midlands, of jobs in the more traditional sector being lost. There is a disproportionate impact on provincial towns. Any agency not acknowledging that and advising the Tánaiste on it is turning a blind eye and pointing to the undoubted successes there are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true we are losing jobs and that some of our traditional industries are in difficulty &ndash; in fact, some have closed. That is because they have not been able to compete with the competitors from elsewhere. There is no evidence, other than maybe one or two isolated cases, of companies closing operations in Ireland and moving operations to other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some examples but they are relatively few. They are no greater now than they were a number of years ago. This is a trend that has been under way for many years and it is certainly no greater now than it was four or five years ago. The challenge for us is to move other operations into Ireland and the policy in relation to many of the companies that are here, some of which are restructuring globally, is to get the more strategic elements of their operation into Ireland with a view to replacing some of the jobs that are falling out at the bottom. That happens all the time and it is continuing to happen.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties we have had is that there was an over concentration in the midlands, in particular, on low value added manufacturing. Portarlington in Laois, Tullamore in Offaly and Longford suffered from a number of closures in recent years, all in the same basic area.</P>

      <P>The picture nationally looks rosy but is the Tánaiste aware that in the Border, midland and western region, the most disadvantaged area in the country, small manufacturing industries are closing down? Almost 9,000 jobs were lost in that region in the past 12 months. Generally, the people losing their jobs have been middle aged and they are finding it difficult to be re-employed. It is causing devastation for their families and communities. What action is being taken to retrain and to get alternative employment for these people?

      <P>Will the Tánaiste clarify the point she made on the restructuring of companies? Is it the case that State funding is being used in restructuring which could result in low skilled jobs being sent abroad rather than being maintained in Ireland? She made the point that we have to encourage hi-tech investment and research and development to the country. Does the Tánaiste not believe the PRSI changes in the budget inhibit that type of investment in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been an increase in the number of jobs being lost to Ireland over the past 12 months as against four or five years ago &ndash; in fact, the contrary is the case and we still gain a very high share of investment into Europe. The last disc drive facility in Europe was in Dundalk, County Louth, and that closed last year.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the value of the euro will have a bearing on the indigenous sector, much of which only exports to the UK and much of which does not have margins such as 20% plus. It is a worry and that is why much of the strategy is devoted to making those companies more competitive, to encouraging and helping them to increase their productivity levels, to installing new equipment and to using modern technology, to embracing new technology and to diversifying in terms of markets. It would be a worry if the pound<i> vis-à-vis </i>sterling went anywhere over 90p. That would place enormous pressure on some Irish companies, particularly in the traditional sector, many of which are outside the larger population areas.</P>
      <P>We are not assisting companies to move jobs offshore. Some companies, particularly in the textile sector, have closed altogether. Other companies, through very innovative approaches, have survived. Companies are helped if it is a survival package in which they are involved but nobody is helped or given assistance to move jobs from Ireland elsewhere. The strategy is to keep jobs in Ireland and to grow employment. It is the case that occasionally companies which are shedding jobs are helped financially to keep fewer jobs and to make them viable. That is very different to helping companies to move activities abroad. We are not in the business of doing that nor would we do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the inconvenience caused to Aer Lingus customers as a result of the current industrial relations dispute in the company. Cabin crew, represented by IMPACT, served notice on Aer Lingus of a 24 hour stoppage tomorrow, 7 February, following its members' rejection of the Labour Court recommendation on the cabin crew claim. The Labour Court recommendation of 22 January 2001 addressed all the issues in dispute. This recommendation was accepted by Aer Lingus but, regretfully, rejected by IMPACT. Aer Lingus, while indicating its extreme disappointment with the IMPACT position, advised that the company was willing to discuss IMPACT's concerns in relation to the Labour Court recommendation. As a result, two days of direct talks took place between Aer Lingus and IMPACT last week but the sides failed to reach any agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand from Aer Lingus that during these talks IMPACT retabled the main elements of its original negotiating position, notwithstanding that the Labour Court had examined the union's argument in reaching its recommendations. Aer Lingus has stated that conceding the IMPACT demand would add £3 million to the cabin crew pay bill on top of the £5.7 million cost <Col N="1261" /> of the implementation of the Labour Court's recommendation.</P>
    <P>This additional burden on the cost base of Aer Lingus, on top of the Labour Court recommendations and the various PPF awards, is unsustainable from the company's viewpoint. Moreover, Aer Lingus is concerned that any settlement of the cabin crew dispute must take account of settlements reached for other groups, such as clerical and operative groups. To do otherwise would not alone have serious cost implications but could also give rise to follow on claims which could undo the successful work of the Labour Court in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court re-entered the dispute last weekend. During negotiations Aer Lingus proposed that the Labour Court recommendation be implemented immediately and, without prejudice to the union position, it should be followed by the establishment of a joint working group to draw up, over a period of a few months, measures on pay and structures to suit the current needs of the airline. IMPACT rejected this proposal. The Labour Court then indicated that it was unable to resolve the matter due to the gap between the two sides.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow's stoppage should have been avoided not just because of the damage it will do to Aer Lingus and the impact on its customers but having regard also to the recently renewed emphasis in the PPF on settling differences without recourse to industrial action. I urge the parties to resume the talks as quickly as possible to work out their differences. The Labour Court remains available to assist in whatever way it can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>What action, if any, has the Minister taken, since chaos first struck the airline last October, to ensure that a wage dispute which everyone accepts is legitimate did not ground the airline? Did that action fail? Why are 18,000 people facing a nightmare at our airports tomorrow? What action has been taken since the emergency talks broke down on Sunday night? Will the Minister accept that the management position, which would entail the workforce accepting a package that 98% of them rejected six days previously, was unrealistic? Was the Minister aware, in advance, of the management's nonsensical offer on Sunday, which has led to the airline shutting down? Will the Minister now instruct management to realistically engage in these vital talks?</P>

      <P>&mdash;but ministerial involvement is not proposed at this point. The State has a range of mechanisms to resolve industrial disputes and they have been beavering away on this issue.

Aer <Col N="1262" /> Lingus proposed last week that the Labour Court recommendation be implemented immediately and, without prejudice to the union's position, it should be followed by the establishment of a joint working group to draw up measures on pay and structures to suit the current needs of the airline.</P>

        <b>:</b> Exhortations are not much good at this stage. Is it not true that the situation in Aer Lingus is an industrial relations disaster? In the past three months the company has stumbled from one industrial relations crisis to another. The cabin crew were on strike before, as were the clerical staff, catering staff and baggage handlers, while the pilots also threatened industrial action. Now it is back to the cabin crew again. Is it not a fact that no commercial company can survive that type of performance? This is not a private company, it is Government owned. If the existing industrial relations machinery has broken down, as it obviously has, given that the gap is so large it cannot be bridged, it is up to the Government as the owner of the company&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Aer Lingus is concerned, it has acknowledged a legitimate case for improving cabin crew pay and has responded accordingly. However, it cannot sustain uncompetitive pay increases. That is the gist of this problem. Similarly, ongoing disruption of the services will have a serious impact on the company's finances, which is not in the best interests of the staff, customers, tourism or business interests. The airline has acknowledged the legitimate case that existed and has responded accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's middle name Pontius Pilate? Is he not aware that the Government is responsible for what is happening in Aer Lingus? The Government is the sole shareholder in the company. Does the Minister not agree that to say the company cannot embark on uncompetitive practices with regard to people whose salaries are as low as £6,000 and £7,000 per annum is an insult to those people? Will he not accept that the offer Aer Lingus made on top of the Labour Court recommendation is utterly unworthy of the company? Can he not understand that the staff and cabin crew are grossly underpaid? They are frontline staff as far as the tourism industry is concerned. What will the Minister do to ensure that the cabin crew are dealt with fairly, get an equitable wage and can return to work without this Mickey Mouse offer being put on the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1263" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>No insult is intended to anybody, least of all the cabin crew. It has been recognised by the company and by the Government that a legitimate case existed. That case was addressed. It might help if I outline what the Labour Court recommended. In so doing I will answer part of Deputy Higgins's question which I failed to answer earlier.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court recommended pay increases ranging from 20% for those on the lower end of the pay scale to 10% for those on the upper end. It recommended a minimum increase of £2,000 to all cabin crew in addition to the PPF increases, the replacement of the 20 hours per week contracts with 35 hours per week contracts, a shortened pay scale where staff reached the top of the scale after 15 years and a long service increment of £500 per annum at 25, 30 and 33 years service and £1,000 after 35 years service.</P>
      <P>Again, I urge the parties to return to the table on the basis of the establishment of the joint working group to tease out further improvements that can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be putting a good spin on the Labour Court proposals. Does he agree that the percentages on very low rates, when completed, still amount to very low rates? Does the Minister of State not think it extraordinary that it would require 20 years' service for an employee to earn £25,000 per year, a figure which would be inclusive of promotion and bonus payments? The Labour Court proposals mean it would take an employee 35 years to reach that point. Given the price of housing in Dublin and other areas in which airports are located, that is not a wage on which people can be expected to live.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree the Labour Court proposals represent a significant contribution to the resolution of this dispute and that IMPACT, in accepting the 15 year pay scale, has displayed a determination to resolve the dispute? Will the Minister of State use his influence in a positive manner rather than the negative manner we have witnessed here where he is, on the one hand, saying this is a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; situation in which the Government will not get involved and, on the other, is rejecting the staff's claim, thereby interfering negatively in the dispute? We are asking the Minister of State to attempt to facilitate the speedy and fair resolution of this dispute by contacting the management of a company owned by the State on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to provide honest and accurate answers to questions on this important matter and I am not putting a spin on what I say. The company must consider the amount it can pay and has already indicated what it considers achievable in economic terms. The implementation of the figure which is being sought is unsustainable from a business point of view and that is not in the interest of the workers, the other sectors within the company or the com<Col N="1264" /> pany itself. I agree with the Deputy that the Labour Court has done its damnedest on this issue. It is ready, willing and able to receive both parties at any time to see what further progress can be made. There is ongoing communication between the Minister, the Department and company management. In the past, Ministers' involvement in disputes such as this has been counterproductive and has at times undermined the machinery, including State agencies such as the one the Deputy lauded, which exist to resolve these problems.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State accept that IMPACT, which represents the majority of the Aer Lingus cabin crew members is an extremely responsible trade union which was one of the key components in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness? IMPACT is now threatening to escalate the dispute and embark on further industrial action. Does the Minister of State accept we simply cannot allow flights to be cancelled, delayed or disrupted again? Given that the industrial relations machinery is not capable of bridging the large gap which exists and that the Department has appointed nominees to the board of this State-owned company, does the Minister of State accept there is an onus on the Government to engage in meaningful dialogue at this juncture to see what can be done to bridge the gap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the bona fides of IMPACT or the other trade union which represents a smaller number of the cabin crew employees. I have more confidence in the machinery of the State, particularly the Labour Court, than the company. While the one day stoppage is very serious and regrettable, it will not result in the entire Irish aviation sector grinding to a halt. Some 40% of Irish airline services are provided by Aer Lingus but the 60% provided by other airlines will keep the commercial wheels rolling. Other airlines will endeavour to provide increased service during the course of tomorrow's unfortunate stoppage. On behalf of the Government, I exhort all of the parties involved to resume talks on this matter.</P>

The Minister of State assumes the airport will still function.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Will the Minister of State agree that a low wage regime for a significant section of the Aer Lingus workforce is the fundamental reason for the industrial relations problem within that company? In light of that, quoting percentage increases or amounts that have been offered does not hold validity, as the Minister has tried to portray them as being generous, when one is coming from a very low wage base. In view of Aer Lingus's £50 million profit last year made by the workers, does the Minister not agree that the workers deserve a meaningful section of this profit? Will he agree there is something badly wrong with the attitude of the management at Aer Lingus when so many groups of workers are obviously alienated and frustrated, that perhaps a management that has one eye on privatisation while keeping up profits at the expense of workers' wages is not the best management to deal with the problem and that an entire change of culture of bringing the workers into real democratic participation in Aer Lingus is the way to create a vibrant airline?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is reprehensible that a semi-State company would attempt to implement a two-tier working condition system for staff who do largely the same employment and that the introduction of the obnoxious practice of yellow pack workers, first introduced by the banks and such cut-throat institutions, should have no place in the public sector? Will he tell Aer Lingus that this must have no place in the development of the company and in trying to create relations with its staff, who are the backbone of the company, from now on?</P>

      <P>As I said, it was acknowledged by all the players, including the Labour Court, that low wages obtained. I remind colleagues of the details of the Labour Court's addressing of the matter, and it was not just percentages. They were minimum amounts stitched in to address the situation. That emanated from the Labour Court and was readily accepted by the company. I do not think we will progress it any further. What has been said here today is obviously in the public arena and I hope it will have the effect of having all concerned return to the table to take up the offer of further talks and resolving the dispute.</P>

      <P>The entire thrust of the Minister's replies has been to concede that there was a low pay regime in Aer Lingus and to imply or say that that has now changed. Is the Minister aware &ndash; I have the proposals that emanated from the Labour Court in front of me &ndash; that it would take a permanent member of cabin crew almost ten years to earn the average industrial wage under the proposals that have emanated from the Labour Relations Commission?</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on that. Is that situation tenable for what used to be considered relatively prestigious employment? I ask the Minister to say to this House that that position is not untenable and to direct the management of Aer Lingus to cause it within the medium term to be put right. Otherwise, given the competitive industrial situation at Dublin Airport, there will be no permanent resolution of this dispute.</P>

      <P>I must come back to what the Labour Court said. The Labour Court issued its recommendations, which it deemed to be fair and reasonable. The management is now saying it accepts what the Labour Court recommended but it wants to talk about the matter further in the joint working group, which it is offering to establish, to see what measures on pay and structures can be agreed. There is no better road to travel on this issue. We have all had our own experiences of these industrial relations difficulties and it is obvious that is the correct road to travel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister of State square the Minister's decision to adopt a hands-off approach to this dispute with the fact that the Taoiseach, who has been present for the duration of the debate, largely made his reputation by adopting a hands-on approach to industrial disputes? Given this historic fact, I ask the Minister to review the policy in this dispute. Is the Minister <Col N="1269" /> of State aware that the public was absolutely stunned when it heard the rates of pay for what were regarded as glamour jobs in Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he agree this dispute is a symptom of low pay in a large part of Aer Lingus? Does he further agree the staff in these low paid jobs made a major contribution to the success of Aer Lingus through their acceptance of the Cahill plan?</P>
      <P>If the Minister will not adopt a hands-on approach to the dispute, will he say if he has a policy on the issue of low pay in the semi-State sector for which the Department is responsible? Does he have a timetable for the eradication of low pay? He should not tell us that bringing people up to the average industrial wage after 15 years is eradicating low pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the huge importance and meritorious nature of the cabin crew sector. I want to repeat that it has already been agreed by all the players, including the Government, that there was an insufficient pay situation in that sector. This is a hugely important sector, as we will see tomorrow when the aviation system stops working. The cabin crew plays a major role <i>vis-à-vis</i> air safety etc. and is trained to deal with emergencies. This role is recognised.</P>
      <P>Without repeating what I have said &ndash; the questions have become somewhat repetitive at this stage &ndash; on behalf of the Government, I exhort the parties to return to the table. That is as much as I can say.</P>

        <b>:</b> Given the chaotic industrial relations situation with Aer Lingus, where all sectors have taken industrial action over the past three months &ndash; we are now into round two with more strikes &ndash; will the Minister of State say if a case can be made for taking a hard objective look at the company in its totality? Does he consider there is merit in the proposal of embarking on an exercise similar to the one embarked on by the Minister in relation to Iarnród Éireann where the so-called three wise men were asked to objectively examine the company, its management and management performance as well as the industrial relations performance to bring to an end once and for all the kind of malaise which is quickly killing the reputation of what was once a fine and proud company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle reminded us at an earlier juncture, we are talking about the cabin crew issue.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the livelihoods of the cabin <Col N="1270" /> crew, most of whom live in constituencies represented by Deputies Ryan and Sargent, the Minister, Deputy Woods, the Taoiseach and me? Is he aware that a young couple who are both working as cabin crew staff &ndash; this happens quite often &ndash; do not even qualify for the shared ownership housing scheme because their salaries are so low? The most they can afford to spend on a house is £60,000 or £70,000, which would not buy a house anywhere. Does the Minister of State agree there needs to be a major leap in the base salary of these workers to allow them to enter meaningful discussions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the comments made by Deputies, particularly the point made by Deputy Owen. When considering the low pay base and extraordinary contribution made by cabin crew over the years, I ask the Minister of State to recognise that this was a category only for women until the position was changed under the equal opportunities legislation. This makes it a special case and explains why this low base has to be increased. The arguments made in the House must be considered in the context of the history of the under-valuing of the work done by women and the low rates of pay they received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>

There is no point in asking a question if the answer is not listened to. I take the opportunity at this stage to make it clear that any legislative changes that might be introduced would not specify any particular waste management instruments. The purpose would be to ensure the adoption throughout the country of regional waste management plans which would adopt an integrated approach to waste management, respecting the widely accepted waste hierarchy.

      <P>A Bill that was expected to be published at the start of this session appears to be already in place &ndash; the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill. Given that in the past two weeks, two prisoners took temporary release when in the care of prison officers, what will the Government do to ensure the security of prisoners when they are being transported from one place to another? I have no doubt that if the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was on this side of the House he would already be shouting from these benches and calling for the ditches of Kerry to be scoured for the prisoners and for whoever was responsible for their escape. Two dangerous prisoners who have escaped within one week seem to be pre-empting that Bill by taking their own temporary release. The position is a shambles.</P>

      <P>The motion for reference to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights relates to the exercise of the option which the State has under the provisions of the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty to take part in the adoption and application of the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status. The background to the motion is broadly as follows.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam came into operation on 1 May 1999. The House will be aware that annexed to that treaty was a protocol, also known as the Fourth Protocol, the effect of which is to exempt Ireland and the United Kingdom from the provisions of Title IV of that treaty which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Protocol, however, also allows either or both countries to opt into particular measures under specified terms and conditions. Article 3 of the protocol provides the State with a three month period to notify its wish to take part in the adoption and application of any proposal from the date such a proposal is presented to the Council, usually by the European Commission, or we may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted. For a transitional period of five years, the overwhelming majority of decisions in relation to proposals tabled must be on the basis of unanimity, but under the terms of the protocol if, after a reasonable period, the proposed measure cannot be adopted with the United Kingdom or Ireland taking part, the other member states may go ahead with the decision in Council without their participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to clarify why the matter is only now coming before the House for consideration. Although it was sent formally to the Council by the Commission at the end of October last year, the final text as communicated to the Council only became available to my Department in mid-November. Prior to considering whether the State should exercise its option under Title IV, the necessary interdepartmental consultations had to take place and Government approval had to be sought for the exercise of the option. Although copies of the proposal for a directive were laid before both Houses on 9 January 2001, due to the intervening Christmas recess, which took up almost half of the 12 week &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; period, it is <Col N="1286" /> only now, on the return of both Houses, that the necessary motion can be considered.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the presentation of this proposal by the European Commission to Council is that if the State wishes to opt into discussions from the beginning, we have until 14 February 2001 to inform the president of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time does not prevent us from participating in Council discussions. However, we would not be able to opt in until such time as the negotiations have been concluded and the measures adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited. The United Kingdom recently conveyed its decision to the Council to exercise its option in respect of the Council directive.</P>
    <P>This initiative is the first major proposal in a series of measures aimed at creating a common European asylum system. The framework for the creation of a common system is already contained in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999 and in Title IV of the EU Treaty which was inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam. At Tampere, the Council agreed to work towards the creation of a common asylum system in the EU on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>While this is the most significant proposal to arise from the Tampere Council agenda in the asylum area, there have also been proposals on the EURODAC fingerprinting regulation, a decision on a European refugee fund and a directive on temporary protection. In the coming months, proposals are expected on common reception standards for asylum seekers, the revision of the Dublin Convention and rules on the recognition and content of refugee status.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion on which I have sought the approval of both Houses for the State to exercise the option provided in the Fourth Protocol in respect of a proposal for an EU legal instrument in the area of asylum policy. The approval of both Houses has already been obtained for participation in discussions at EU level aimed at the adoption and application of a Council regulation concerning the establishment of EURODAC for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain non-nationals and a Council decision on the European refugee fund. The option has also been exercised in respect of other proposals for EU instruments mainly in the area of judicial co-operation in civil matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the main elements of this proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status in respect of which discussions recently commenced in a Council working party in Brussels. The purpose of this proposal is to set out requisite measures for dealing with asylum applications in EU states as part of the creation of a common EU asylum system, based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention. The aim is to set down com<Col N="1287" /> mon minimum standards for dealing with asylum applications. The intention is not to require member states to apply uniform procedures or to oblige them to adopt common concepts and practices which they do not wish to apply. All standards for a fair and efficient procedure are laid down without prejudice to member states' discretionary power to prioritise cases on the basis of national policies.</P>
    <P>The proposed directive essentially contains three different sets of provisions which relate to procedural guarantees, the decision-making process and the application of certain concepts and practices. Chapter One of the proposed directive sets out its scope, including its purpose, which is to establish minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status. It also contains the main definitions.</P>
    <P>Chapter Two contains the basic principles and procedural guarantees for dealing with asylum applications. These procedural guarantees relate to all stages of the asylum procedure and are designed to ensure procedural fairness in the asylum process. The key basic principles and guarantees contained in the proposed directive include the right of asylum applicants to have access to the asylum procedure as soon as possible; the right of each asylum applicant to remain on the territory of the member state as long as his or her application for asylum is being considered; and a number of procedural guarantees which apply to every asylum applicant, including the right to be informed of the asylum procedure to be followed, the right to an interpreter, the right to a written decision and the right to appeal a first instance negative decision. All these and other key procedural guarantees are features of the Irish asylum system and most are enshrined in the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Chapter Two also contains provisions on the processing of asylum applications from unaccompanied minors, the detention of applicants, the provision of resources and training for determining authorities, the right of access by UNHCR personnel to applicants and the protection of applicants' identities. While member states may retain their own national asylum systems, the intention of these provisions is to ensure that decision making meets certain minimum requirements in the interest of developing a comprehensive common European asylum policy.</P>
    <P>Chapter Three contains standards for the application of an admissibility procedure, including proposals for the grounds under which an application can be deemed inadmissible. These include the safe third country principle. As I mentioned previously, each member state may decide whether to apply the admissibility concept, but if it does so, its national application would have to follow the common framework for all member states. Accordingly, if a member state applies an admissibility procedure to dismiss an application as inadmissible on the basis of the safe third country concept, it will have to abide by the com<Col N="1288" /> mon principles for designating a country as a safe third country as laid down in Annex I to the proposal as well as the common requirements for applying the concept in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Chapter Four deals with substantive determination procedures and provides for a regular procedure and an accelerated procedure. While there is no obligation to apply an accelerated procedure to deal with manifestly unfounded applications, member states will have to abide by the common definitions and maximum time limits if they do so. With regard to the safe country of origin principle, which applies in some other EU states, Annex II of the proposal lays down a common approach to the designation of countries as safe following consideration of a range of information on the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Chapter Five deals with appeals procedures and provides for an appeal to a reviewing body such as our refugee appeals tribunal. In certain circumstances, a further appeal may lie to an appellate court.</P>
    <P>Chapter Six contains provisions on penalties for the infringement of the national provisions adopted pursuant to the directive. The text of the proposal generally reflects many of the key elements of Ireland's domestic asylum legislation and procedures. Our procedures encompass strict safeguards to guarantee fairness and to provide for a first stage determination process and an independent appeals mechanism in the case of a negative recommendation at first stage, and applicants for asylum may also apply to the High Court for a judicial review of their case. The Refugee Act, 1996, also provides a statutory right to consult a solicitor, a right to interpretation and a right of access by the UNHCR to the asylum process.</P>
    <P>There are also, however, some differences between Ireland's asylum procedure and that contained in the proposal, such as, time limits for making appeals and for examining asylum applications and the inclusion of a third tier appeal to the Appellate Court on both facts and points of law, all of which will be considered in detail during the negotiations at Council Working Party level. The proposal also contains concepts which are new to us, such as, the safe country of origin principle, the admissibility procedure and the provision for an appeal in certain cases not to have suspensive effect. These concepts are not obligatory and of course all member states have discretion to decide whether to adopt concepts and practices which are not currently part of the Irish asylum system.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to be committed to meeting the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention both by identifying and protecting genuine refugees and by more quickly dealing with those asylum applications which are clearly not from genuine asylum seekers. As the House will be aware, the Government has allocated major additional resources to the asylum area, including 370 additional staff, aimed at speeding up processing times in respect of asylum <Col N="1289" /> applications, including appeals, and to deal with the consequential increase in the level of repatriations of people whose applications for refugee status are unsuccessful. In addition, significant additional resources have been made available to the Refugee Legal Service to ensure it can provide a comprehensive and quality legal service to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process.</P>
    <P>This proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status is likely to be the subject of lengthy and protracted debate at EU level involving as it does the marrying of various member states' asylum systems. The exercise of Ireland's discretion to opt into discussions on this proposal will initially involve only participation in those discussions at Council working party level leading, in due course, to the adoption and application of the instrument. When adopted by the Council, it is likely to be a key instrument governing the grant and withdrawal of refugee status in the member states of the EU.</P>
    <P>The conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty amendments took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EC Treaty to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrangements with the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Government is of the view that it is important for Ireland to respond positively to the tabling of this proposal by exercising our option before the deadline of 14 February 2001 in order that the State is able to fully participate in and influence discussions on this significant instrument from the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just had 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael agrees that Ireland should opt into the discussions concerning the proposed Council directive on minimum standards for determining asylum applications. However, we are concerned that this State and all other European Union member states must, in the context of these discussions and in the framing of any directive, abide by their international obligations as members of the United Nations to provide protection to refugees seeking asylum. This must be the central focal point for the proposed common EU asylum system. We must not adopt a fortress Ireland mentality, nor must we conspire with other European Union states to create a fortress Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the Government has failed to articulate and implement a coherent and humanitarian policy applicable to refugees and asylum seekers. The procedures in place for determining asylum applications have resulted in a backlog of thou<Col N="1290" /> sands awaiting decision, unsure of their future, deprived of their entitlement to work and dependent on State hand-outs on which the majority would prefer not to have to rely. It is bizarre that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to prevent asylum seekers from taking up temporary employment at a time when it is Government policy to encourage immigration to fill thousands of vacant jobs. By cutting off asylum seekers from social welfare funds and insisting on &ldquo;direct provision&rdquo;, the Government has not only denied them access to goods and services but has also contributed to the marginalisation of people seeking asylum. Asylum seekers have been effectively labelled as &ldquo;different&rdquo; and this labelling has exacerbated difficulties some experience in integrating in the communities in which they are living.</P>
    <P>Dispersal of refugees to various parts of the country has often resulted in them being located at a substantial distance from the nearest urban centre and the limited funding available to them has restricted their freedom of movement to meet others of similar background and ethnicity. It also, in the context of some refugees, deprives them of essential social services and health services and supports, which they require and to which they are entitled. While preaching the need to tolerate diversity, policies implemented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have directly contributed to a growth in racism and xenophobia.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on many occasions stated that the Government will meet its international obligations to refugees. He has, however, failed to publicly explain the pre-emptive exclusion of asylum seekers effected by it since 20 November last in the context of action taken to prevent the arrival of asylum seekers in Rosslare. The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, among others, has rightly highlighted this issue. On this issue, the Minister was remarkably silent in his speech.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publicly confirm that the frontiers of this State remain open to refugees properly seeking asylum. While recent action taken by him may for a brief period stem the flow of refugees, it will inevitably drive many of those desperate to find a safe haven into the arms of criminal gangs on whom they will rely to get to our shores. It is the criminal gangs trafficking in human cargo the Government should target and not refugees who, under international law, are entitled to come to our shores to seek and be granted asylum.</P>
    <P>The brief period of time allocated to this debate today renders it apparent that the Government does not wish the plight of refugees and its failed policies to be discussed in detail in this House. While it is important that we participate in discussions with other EU member states on putting in place better procedures across Europe to address the needs of refugees and asylum applicants, we must bring to those discussions a positive commitment to ensure a safe haven is given to those who require it. This requires the <Col N="1291" /> Government to acknowledge that the time has come for it to take a more open and constructive approach.</P>
    <P>The Government should also urgently amend section 19 of the Refugee Act, which prevents the media from reporting concerns expressed by asylum seekers in this State about their plight and which requires a consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for such publication to take place. On the Order of Business the Taoiseach indicated that the Government is now considering bringing forward such legislation, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made no reference to such promise in his speech to this House. It does not appear to be a priority of the Government. It suits the Government that refugees seeking asylum in the State are spancelled from making public comment in the print media and on national television and radio stations and from highlighting the difficulties in which they find themselves as a result of the failures of the Government. A failure to urgently amend the relevant legislation could result in the State being brought, yet again, before the European Court for being in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There is a need for a different approach to be taken by the Government. There is nothing I have seen in the past three and a half years nor is there anything in what the Minister has said to us today which indicates there is any real possibility of that happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Government's decision to opt into the discussions at a European level from the beginning on this extraordinarily fundamental right and liberty, and the contribution the European Union can make from its privileged stance. I have a few queries on the matter. I hope Ireland's contribution will include urging other EU member states to increase the European refugee fund. I remind the Minister that the proportion Ireland will receive will be small. Given the funding needed at European level, the point should be made that the funding should be significantly increased. The European Union can afford it.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the procedures encompass strict safeguards to guarantee fairness and provide a first stage determination process and an independent appeals mechanism. I will be careful not to confuse the categories of refugees and immigrants seeking work here. There have been lamentable and shameful occasions when both refugees and immigrants on coming to this country have been so extraordinarily treated that, as a country, we should be ashamed. People coming to Ireland believing they could work and being stopped on entry by one person and ending up in jail and being shackled is something I hope we will never have to countenance again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider giving the necessary training in sensitivity to staff at all lev<Col N="1292" /> els who work in this crucial area and to consider the line of command where decisions are made so that responsibility for making such decisions does not rest on one person at ports and airports. It is not fair to staff and is less than fair to people on the receiving end of the decisions. I would like a greater discussion with and contribution from the Minister not only about the increase in staff but about the training of staff working in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The exercise of Ireland's discretion to opt in to discussions on this proposal will initially only involve participation in those discussions at Council working party level leading in due course to the adoption and application of the instrument. When adopted by the Council, it is likely to be a key instrument governing the grant and withdrawal of refugee status in the member states of the EU.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House how information on ongoing discussions at European level will be conveyed to the House, especially to Opposition Members? It is of crucial importance that we receive ongoing briefing on the discussions at European level so that the discussions and decisions taken at that level have the approval and knowledge of all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that section 19 is highly dangerous and is an infringement of the rights of people who may become Irish citizens. They should have the right at every level and certainly before their cases are determined to freedom of expression, especially given that many people seeking refugee status come from regimes where such freedom is not just restricted but is punishable. That is all the more reason we should guarantee freedom of expression in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the referral motion on the agenda, I was anxious that there be a debate on the procedures involved in this very important issue. While I will mention some detail concerning the proposals, I will leave the bulk of what I have to say about that to the debate at the committee. What is more important and what I regard as the essential issue I want to raise and the reason I requested the Labour Party Whip to ensure there would be a debate, notwithstanding the Government's intention to have the procedural motion passed without debate, is that we act for once as a real parliament in matters of European competence.</P>
      <P>We are all bamboozled sometimes by the complexity of legal instruments coming from the European Union. I had the privilege of serving as President of the Council of Ministers in my time and of being a member of two European Councils. I am aware of the enormous volume of work undertaken within the ambit of the European institutions, especially by COREPER in Brussels, which is basically the drafting of legislation which ultimately finds its way to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> I am not satisfied and neither should Members be with a situation where a Community instrument is almost finalised in negotiations between talented and able public servants acting on instructions from a Government or Department and where we are presented with net issues to which we say &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo;. Even then, they are presented late or at the last minute and we are told there is very little time for debate. We had a discussion on EURODAC not on the basis of whether we wanted to be part of the process to see what a common system of asylum treatment should be within the European Union, rather on the basis of what was agreed and whether we accepted it in the knowledge that a Government majority existed to force it through anyway. Things are done differently in other national parliaments of the European Union. I say this in the hope that the Minister listens in a fair and open way.</P>
    <P>The basis for common European action on asylum seekers other than the UN Geneva Convention is the Dublin Convention. That convention had its genesis in a decision made on 5 June 1990 when member states of the European Union signed it. The reality is that the Dublin Convention does not work. The Minister placed great store last year by the fact that one of the options available to us was to repatriate asylum seekers under the Dublin Convention principles to the country from where they first came. As, I am sure, the Minister will tell the House, the reality is that more people have been accepted back into Ireland under the terms of the Dublin Convention than we have sent back to other European countries. That is an extraordinary state of affairs given that it is hard to envisage many people arriving here as a first port of entry to the European Union.</P>
    <P>There has been a degree of criticism of the operation of the Dublin Convention by the Commission. The difficulties inherent in the operation of the convention have been acknowledged by the Commission and by member states. The Commission was to carry out a detailed evaluation prior to proposing formally a Community instrument to replace the Dublin Convention. Certain of the instruments adopted, and the Minister referred to them, for example, decision one of 2000 and EURODAC, address some of the criticisms, but there are others. I note that the conclusions of the European Council at Tampere in October 1999 stated that, in the longer term, Community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum which would be valid throughout the Union.</P>
    <P>The Commission has prepared a communication on this issue. My difficulty is that we will authorise Irish participation in the preparation of this Community instrument. The Minister in his contribution indicated for the first time some of the content of those discussions. He said:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this proposal is to set out requisite measures for dealing with asylum <Col N="1294" /> applications in EU states as part of the creation of a common EU asylum system based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention. The aim is to set down common minimum standards for dealing with asylum applications. The intention is not to require member states to apply uniform procedures or to oblige them to adopt common concepts and practices [if they do not wish to do so].</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the issue. By attending a seminar on these matters in the King's Inns recently &ndash; thankfully, also attended by officials of the Minister's Department &ndash; I found out that they were being discussed. I did not realise, for example, that welfare provisions were to be incorporated in this instrument, the objective being that there would be a common mechanism for dealing with asylum seekers and a common understanding on which country should deal with the issue to avoid having what were referred to as asylum seekers in orbit between member states. I am aware that under the Dublin Convention there is a difficulty in determining which country is responsible. Notwithstanding the fact that the terms of an article of the convention set out a timeframe after which it is assumed that responsibility will be accepted, there are inordinate delays, well beyond the 90 days provided for. We need to get our act together to ensure there is a common procedure which is understood. It was understood that the procedures allowed for burden sharing within the European Union to ensure the full burden would not fall to be carried by member states bordering non-EU countries.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the nitty-gritty of these proposals at the joint committee, but I would like the Minister to respond to the following fundamental question. Will the committee system put in place by this Parliament and which is designed, in theory at least, to scrutinise and give democratic authority to Ministers to negotiate in the name of Ireland be allowed to work? No Danish Minister goes to a meeting of the European Council without first discussing in detail the proposals to be discussed at European level with the relevant committee of the Danish Parliament and seeking its views. He or she reports back to the committee after the meeting. By and large, there is no communication here on extremely important European matters until they are finalised, save on issues such as this in respect of which there is a legal requirement, following a decision under a protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty to opt out of a common asylum policy, to seek the authority of the House to participate in discussions.</P>
    <P>There is a prejudice and an attitude within the public service which sees the Executive, that is, the Government, as its master, not the democratic assembly of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann. On this critical issue, which will be controversial and on which there is a divergence of opinion within this House, as we discovered when matters of a similar nature were discussed, will the Minister give an assurance that, step by step, <Col N="1295" /> his attitude and approach and the instructions he will give to his officials will be discussed with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to ensure there is a democratic debate on this matter, which is of great importance?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the draft order entitled:</P>
      <P>Maternity Protection Act, 1994 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order, 2001, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of January 2001.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the draft order entitled:</P>
      <P>Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order, 2001, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These orders provide for an extension to maternity and adoptive leave which attracts payment of four weeks and an extension to additional unpaid maternity and adoptive leave of four weeks. These orders will implement the budget announcement of 6 December 2000 to extend periods of maternity and adoptive leave. The effect of these orders is to increase maternity leave which attracts payment to 18 weeks and additional unpaid leave to eight weeks. Adoptive <Col N="1296" /> leave attracting payment will increase to 14 weeks and additional unpaid leave to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>There have been major changes in society and to the make-up of the labour force due to Ireland's unprecedented rate of economic growth. With the growth in the economy, more and more young mothers are staying in the workforce. In 1994, the female labour force participation rate was 35.7%. According to latest CSO figures, it is now 49.4% . Furthermore, the participation rate for women aged between 15 and 45 years, roughly corresponding to childbearing years, is 61.5%.</P>
    <P>The change in the composition of the workforce brings with it a necessary change of attitude. Our focus should not merely be to entice women into the labour force. We should provide workplace conditions that value their contribution. The whole area of maternity protection, in creating an environment which permits women to be fully integrated into the workforce while valuing their childbearing role, has become hugely relevant.</P>
    <P>There is a growing demand for child care places. The difficulty for parents in accessing high quality affordable child care for babies under one year old is particularly acute. The proposed increases in maternity and adoptive leave will contribute towards an alleviation of this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I have introduced many initiatives in the equality area and on family friendly policies since I came into office in 1997. These orders are the result of the recommendations of a working group established by my Department to review and improve maternity protection legislation. The working group was established in accordance with commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments and agencies. Adoptive leave was not discussed by the working group, but the Government decided that, in the interests of equity, the increases in maternity leave recommended by the group would also be made applicable to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>The orders to increase maternity and adoptive leave are part of a larger package of recommendations agreed by the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. The working group's recommendation to increase maternity leave has been fast-tracked ahead of the other recommendations to ensure women can benefit from the increase as quickly as possible. The report of the working group will be published later this month.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations will involve primary legislation. There will be ample opportunity to discuss issues surrounding the area of maternity protection when I publish legislation implementing other recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am empowered under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, with the consent of my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community <Col N="1297" /> and Family Affairs, to increase by order maternity leave which attracts payment and unpaid maternity leave. I have a similar power under the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. The Acts also require a resolution to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the orders can be signed into law.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced on 6 December 2000 that the increased entitlements would apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided for in the annual Social Welfare Bill apply from April, or somewhat later. Following the budget announcement, my officials looked into the possibility of applying the maternity and adoptive leave increases not only to women who commence maternity or adoptive leave on or after early April, but also to women who go on leave prior to that date. The issue was examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the orders comply with the parent Acts. Under both the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, a person taking maternity or adoptive leave must give four weeks' notice to their employer of taking such leave. The Attorney General has advised me that in view of the notice requirements under both Acts it would not be possible to have the orders extend the period of maternity or adoptive leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements of the parent Acts. Any attempt to make the orders retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge. It is, therefore, necessary for me to provide that the orders will take effect four weeks after they are signed into law to comply with the four week notice requirements under both Acts.</P>
    <P>These increases in maternity and adoptive leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity and adoptive benefit. They will have a major impact on employers in many ways, for example, the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected and in some cases contractual obligation in respect of payment. A balance between the rights of employees and employers is contained in the parent Acts. We must respect this balance in making the orders under those Acts.</P>
    <P>As Members can see, I was constrained by the notice requirements under the Acts in terms of how soon I could implement the budget announcement. My aim is to implement the increase as far in advance of 2 April as possible while complying with the parent Acts. The passing of a resolution in the House today and a similar one in the Seanad later this week would mean that I would be in a position, together with the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, to sign the orders into law immediately. The extended periods of maternity and adoptive leave, which attract payment, will, <Col N="1298" /> therefore, apply to persons commencing such leave in early March instead of 2 April.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the entitlement to unpaid leave will apply to any person who has more than four weeks maternity or adoptive leave left on the date the order is signed into law. This is because the notice requirements in the parent Acts in relation to unpaid leave are different from those for paid leave. The revised entitlement to unpaid leave will apply to persons who went on maternity leave from end November 2000.</P>
    <P>There are three types of maternity and adoptive leave: first, leave which attracts payment; second, unpaid leave; and, third, leave for fathers in the event of the death of the mother within a certain period of the birth or adoption placement.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of both orders relates to the commencement dates. It provides that the increased entitlement to maternity and adoptive leave which attracts payment will apply to women who commence such leave four weeks after the signing of the order into law.</P>
    <P>The situation is somewhat different in relation to unpaid leave. Article 2 of both orders provides that the increased entitlement to unpaid leave will apply to any person who commences additional unpaid maternity or adoptive leave four weeks after the orders are signed into law. Article 2 of both orders also provides for a commencement date which complies with the notice requirements of the parent Acts in relation to fathers who take leave in the event of the death of the mother within a certain period of the birth or the adoption placement.</P>
    <P>Articles 1 and 3 of both orders are standard technical provisions. Article 4 of the maternity leave order extends the period of maternity leave under section 8(1) of the parent Act from 14 to 18 weeks. This is the period of maternity leave which attracts a payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the maternity leave order amends section 13(2) of the parent Act. The subsection provides for an entitlement to maternity leave when a confinement occurs four weeks or more before the expected date and before the employee has gone on maternity leave. Article 5 extends this entitlement from 14 to 18 weeks. This ties in this section with the overall increased entitlement under the order.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the maternity leave order provides that the period of additional unpaid maternity leave under section 14(1) of the parent Act will be extended to eight weeks. Article 7 of the maternity leave order amends section 16 of the parent Act which covers leave for fathers in the event of the death of the mother after confinement. The mother must be survived by the baby. Article 7 extends the period within which the father is entitled to leave in the event of the death of the mother and the periods of leave to which the father is entitled in line with the increases in maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of adoptive leave under section 6 of <Col N="1299" /> the parent Act from ten to 14 weeks. This is the period of adoptive leave which attracts a payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of additional unpaid leave under section 8(1) of the parent Act from four to eight weeks. Article 6 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of leave to which a father would be entitled in the event of the death of the adopting mother to a maximum of 14 weeks. Article 7 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of additional unpaid leave to which a father would be entitled in the event of the death of an adopting mother to a maximum of eight weeks.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the adoptive leave order amends section 12(1) of the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, which sets out arrangements for the termination of adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave in the event of the termination of an adoption placement before the end of the period of leave to which the employee is entitled under the Act. I commend the orders to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day last December, all sides welcomed the Government's announcement to increase paid maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, as had been recommended by a committee appointed to look into the issue. A similar increase in adoptive leave is also welcomed. Astonishingly, at the time of the announcement, the Government stated that the increases in maternity and adoptive leave would only be <Col N="1300" /> applicable to women commencing such leave on or after 2 April 2001. Many expectant mothers whose babies were to be born between budget day and 2 April felt not only let down but also misled by the budget announcement.</P>
    <P>On average 4,500 children are born each month in the State. Consequently, between budget day and 2 April it was reasonable to estimate that 17,500 children would be born to mothers in the State. Approximately, 60% of these mothers qualify for maternity benefit and, as a result, 10,500 mothers whose babies were born after budget day were excluded by the Minister from benefiting from the additional four weeks paid maternity leave.</P>
    <P>It was necessary that a motion be tabled and passed before both the Dáil and the Seanad to give effect to the Government's budget day announcement. If this had been done on budget night, all mothers to whom children were born following the budget would have been entitled to the four weeks extra paid maternity leave. The Minister has to date failed to explain why the appropriate motion was not tabled with the other financial resolutions adopted by the Dáil that evening.</P>
    <P>Understandably, pregnant mothers whose children were due prior to 2 April were outraged that they were excluded from availing of the additional maternity leave. Their plight was brought to the attention of Ministers by many Fine Gael Members, and I suspect a few Government backbenchers and members of the Labour Party, and as late as last Tuesday, the Minister continued to resist bringing forward application of the additional maternity benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that under political pressure from Fine Gael, this motion is before the House which, if also passed in the Seanad no later than Thursday of this week, will entitle all mothers who commence maternity leave on or after 8 March next to the additional four weeks of paid maternity leave to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>It is, however, disgraceful that the same leave period will not be available to mothers of children born between budget day and 8 March and who took maternity leave prior to 8 March. The Government has displayed extraordinary incompetence in implementing the new maternity leave arrangements. Following the budget day announcement, Departments were unable to clarify which Minister had responsibility for bringing the required motion before each House of the Oireachtas. Initially, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs thought it was his responsibility. It then emerged that the responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is clear that this confusion is partially responsible for the delay in implementing the measure. This confusion should have been resolved before the budget announcement. On the night of the budget the motion we are now dealing with should have been dealt with in this House and if <Col N="1301" /> not on that night, in the Seanad, or certainly on the following night.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made by Government to provide the additional four weeks' maternity leave to all mothers whose children were born on or after budget day, or they should be given some financial compensation for the fact that did not happen. I listened with interest to what the Minister said about the Attorney General's advice. The difficulty the Minister got into would not have occurred had this motion been moved on budget night. The difficulty the Minister describes, and for which the Government is entirely at fault, could have been resolved by the publication of a simple reforming Bill which could have been passed in the space of half an hour, by agreement with all Opposition parties. It would have required the amendment of one, and possibly a second, section. A minor amendment could have been introduced to this effect, but the Government chose not to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government has annoyed a great many pregnant mothers throughout the country by the manner in which it has dealt with this issue. It has also caused confusion. Will the Minister confirm that following the passing of this resolution the appropriate motion will be before the Seanad, either tomorrow or on Thursday, that implementation of this measure will be delayed no further and that, following the passage of both motions, the Government will make immediate arrangements by public advertising to make all pregnant women aware of the new date from which the additional four weeks' maternity leave will apply?</P>
    <P>The Government has made a U-turn which I welcome. If the Government had shown more competence on budget day this particular difficulty would not have arisen in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of paid maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, but I wish to raise a number of points. When this measure was announced in the budget last December it was said that it would be applicable from April. That immediately deprived thousands of women not just of money but also of the opportunity to spend extra time with their new babies. It is precious and essential time, not just for the babies themselves but also for the families involved to reorganise themselves and get used to the idea of having a new and totally dependent human being in the household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been explained that the measure was postponed because of the necessity to bring these orders before the House. For the life of me, however, I cannot see why it should take from December to April to do so. It could have been done without debate before Christmas, thereby allowing thousands of women to benefit. However, those women were deprived not just of financial benefit but also of time to spend with their small babies. The Government decided not to do that and, what is even worse, when faced with thousands of angry phone calls it was still not realised that the matter was being dealt with <Col N="1302" /> by the wrong Department. Up to last week, I was having lengthy conversations with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs about the great work it was doing in preparing the orders and how soon it was hoped to have them ready. Only in the last week, however, did it come to light that this matter was the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Apparently, neither Minister knew who was responsible. This shows just how much importance the Government attaches to the issue. From start to finish this has been a complete fiasco and it has certainly aggrieved more people than it has pleased.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the issue has been solved, albeit belatedly. The Minister should clearly confirm for all women who can avail of this extension of paid maternity leave exactly from when it will apply. Will the Minister confirm that the measure will apply for everybody who gives in their notice from tomorrow &ndash; when, I understand, it will be before the Seanad &ndash; and from that day forth?</P>
    <P>Eighteen weeks is an inadequate amount of maternity leave to grant parents. There is no need for me to go over all the research which points to the importance of a child's early life and the implications of that quality time for the rest of their lives. How we care for and nurture our children is important not just for the children themselves and for individual families but also for society at large. That is one of the biggest questions facing our society which is rapidly changing. It is not merely a financial issue, it is about giving our children the best possible start in life and giving families choices about how best they can do that, as well as maintaining essential household income.</P>
    <P>The length of paid maternity leave is crucial to the decision-making process for mothers when they are deciding whether to stay at home or return to the workforce. The Minister said that women's participation in the workforce is high and rising, but this is occurring at a huge cost to parents, particularly mothers, who are under additional strain. The Minister should examine the question of further extending paid maternity leave.</P>
    <P>The same arguments apply to adoptive leave. A number of attempts to circumvent the law in this respect have been brought to my attention. When people in uncertain employment, who do not have contracts or are on probation, seek adoptive leave they are sacked from their jobs. People often cannot plan for this eventuality and they may be waiting months or years for a chance to adopt. The Minister should examine this deliberate and unacceptable attempt to circumvent the law.</P>

      <P>I welcome the extension of maternity and adoptive leave but I agree with Deputy Mitchell it is still a very short time in comparison to other EU countries. I would like to see progress being made on that matter as soon as possible. I also wish to raise the issue of the starting date for this leave. As Deputy Shatter said, we could have passed a motion at the time of the budget which would have introduced the leave at a much earlier stage. While I hesitate to question the advice of the Attorney General, is it not possible for people to give four weeks' statutory notice that they are taking leave, without the new time arrangement having to be introduced? If they give four weeks' statutory notice, surely that will still bring it in at an earlier stage? In other words, why can I not give notice to my employer tomorrow that I intend taking maternity leave in four weeks' time and still benefit from the extended time when it comes in? I cannot see what the problem is because one is still giving four weeks' notice to the employer. Perhaps the Minister will address that question.</P>
      <P>Maternity leave and parental leave are very short in comparison to other EU countries. I and other speakers have raised the issue of paid parental leave many times in the House. In Denmark, France and Luxembourg, for example, mothers can avail of up to 26 weeks maternity leave and receive a 100% security payment. Countries such as Sweden, Austria and France provide at least 12 months paid parental leave. This country should move towards a position where parents can make choices about the amount of time they wish to spend with their children when they are very young. Many young parents sometimes question the sanity of their lifestyles, when they are running around the clock trying to organise their children, get to work on time and pay mortgages and other bills, while just about making ends meet. It would make an enormous difference for those parents to be able to make the choice of one or other of them being paid to be at home with their children for a year or so after the birth. While many parents wish to remain working, many others would like to have the choice of taking paid leave when their children are very young.</P>
      <P>The issue of breast feeding mothers is one which has been raised with many of us recently. Maternity leave is particularly important to them but so too are facilities for breast feeding in the workplace. The Minister should make some provisions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the question of <i>force majeure </i>leave, which is provided for in the Parental Leave Act. Recently, a mother won a case in relation to<i> force majeure</i> leave. The Minister should embark on a programme of information in regard to that leave. If one asks many parents if they know they have the right to take three days off in an urgent situation, such as the illness of a child, they would <Col N="1304" /> probably say they have never heard of this leave. They are entitled to it and to be paid for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the working group's report will be published shortly. I request that we have an opportunity to debate this report, preferably in the House, but certainly at committee. A number of these issues will be addressed in that report and we should have time to debate them because they are very important to young parents who want to give their best to their jobs and their children.</P>
    <P>We are very far behind other countries in this area. I was particularly disappointed we did not introduce paid parental leave when that leave was introduced. The Minister introduced the leave only because he had to and was forced to amend what was originally introduced because it was not in accordance with the EU directive. On the question I raised about giving four weeks' notice, if there is any way around that, even at this stage, it should be examined because, as other Deputies have said, many parents are disappointed they will not be able to avail of what was announced on budget day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the announcement in the budget to extend maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks. However, pregnant women believe they were conned by the announcement. Because of the angle taken by the Government at the time, they believed they would be entitled to the extended leave, but as it transpired this has not happened for thousands of expectant mothers.</P>
      <P>I have received a lot of representations from pregnant women on this issue and I have endeavoured to raise it in the House with the Taoiseach. I plead with the Minister, notwithstanding the recommendations of the Attorney General, to look at this issue again. Many women work not out of choice but because of the necessity to provide a home, pay a mortgage and so on. These women will lose out because of this restriction. As Deputy Shatter said, this could have been provided for if it had been brought before the Dáil on the night of the budget. It should be possible to provide for mothers who are in receipt of maternity leave payments on the date of the signing of this order. The mothers to whom I refer have already gone to their employer to give four weeks' notice of their intention to take maternity leave under the legislation &ndash; they have already gone through that procedure. The only issue at question here is the extended period. It is not the employer who will pay the money in this case but the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scandal that so many pregnant women will lose out on the basis of this report. They have paid PRSI and have gone out to work when perhaps they might have preferred to stay at home. Before this debate ends this evening, I ask that the Taoiseach allow the Minister to take on board the concerns of not only Opposition Deputies but, I presume, Government Deputies and to go back to the Attorney General to see if this can <Col N="1305" /> be dealt with. An injustice is being perpetrated on many pregnant women who have paid their taxes and so on.</P>
    <P>If employers take issue with this because they were not told their employees would be on maternity leave for another four weeks, so be it. Let us deal with that. There are thousands of employers who appreciate the workload of the individuals in this situation. I ask the Minister to provide the additional maternity leave to those who are in receipt of maternity leave payments on the date this order is signed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, every step towards this extension of paid and unpaid maternity leave has been minimalist and it has a negative rather than a positive tone to it. I will not use the few minutes I have to speak reiterating what has been, and will be, said by colleagues other than to agree with it. Women in this country have waited a long time for this concession which does not go far enough. I hope this is the first of many extensions. Let us introduce the measure positively and as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Whenever such legislation is introduced, usually as a result of our membership of the European Union, there is foot dragging. We had to fight for equal pay and had to go to Europe for equal opportunity. Maternity leave was minimal and we had to fight for the small amount given by the State and, indeed, we had to fight the discriminatory actions of employers. It is regrettable that in 2001, when this country is encouraging women to join the workforce and when economic demands mean they have to participate in the workforce, we make these demands on women. Even when we give them small concessions, we do so in a miserly, niggardly and demeaning way. I agree with every speaker that every effort should be made to implement this measure as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the lowest level of leave arrangements in Europe for working parents to take care of their children. That is combined with the lowest level of maternity payment and no payment for parental level. On a league table of member states of the European Union, we are at the bottom with the UK. This country's Constitution and tradition has placed a great demand and onus on mothers, but there has been only lip service and we have not been paid to the extent we should.</P>
      <P>Finland, France, Germany and Spain provide up to 52 weeks paid parental leave. Germany, for example, provides 14 weeks maternity leave at 100% salary and 36 months paid leave afterwards to be divided between the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an annoying and depressing sequence of events to be obliged to argue with and put pressure on the Minister to remove the word &ldquo;unpaid&rdquo; from the legislation relating to paternity leave. It was only with huge effort that we had the word removed so we could work on the fact that paternity leave should also be paid. The next step involves more than just extending the level of maternity benefit, its length and the unpaid limits <Col N="1306" /> for both fathers and mothers. The next budget must, in fairness to fathers, provide for paid paternity leave. All Members, including the Minister, know that if we are to encourage men to share domestic and parenting responsibilities we must allow them to have paid paternity leave.</P>
    <P>Until we realise that our children are the most important contribution we make to society and to the future of the economy, we will continue to deny the rights of mothers and fathers as parents. I deplore the confusion that occurred between the two Departments and the lack of understanding of what was required with regard to such long awaited legislation. They should have been prepared for the introduction of the extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I watch with awe the capacity of working parents, particularly working mothers, to juggle the demands on their time made by the needs of their children and their financial obligations to meet repayments on mortgages, car loans and so forth. I have no personal experience in this regard.</P>
      <P>While it would be churlish to be entirely critical of the measures before the House to extend paid and unpaid leave by four weeks respectively, the Government was hamfisted in its efforts to implement this improvement. It is also particularly mean spirited in so far as it discriminates against approximately 10,500 families whose children were born since the Budget Statement and for whom this improved benefit will not be available. Ireland shapes up poorly by international standards in regard to maternity leave. As Deputy Barnes pointed out, it is bottom of the league table.</P>
      <P>Had this matter been properly thought through it would have been possible to make it available to the maximum number of parents. It should have been introduced on the night the budget was announced. That begs a question about the State's priorities and whether it is running an economy or running a society. We would not forget to increase excise duties on petrol or cigarettes but when it comes to making financial provision for the proper care of children and families, we have been found seriously wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Ryan's view. I am not competent to second guess the Attorney General's legal advice that it is not possible to overcome the four weeks' notice requirement. The Government is not unwilling to spend the money but it is hiding behind legalese. If we legally have no other way around it, could the Minister not consider a once off financial payment as recognition of the Government's blunder in not introducing this order on budget night and making it available to the maximum number of people? According to the Minister, we are caught on the question of notice to employers. I can understand the problem for an employer who might find it difficult in the current environment to recruit additional staff to provide cover and who has made the necessary arrangements only to find that they are <Col N="1307" /> out by a possible eight weeks of paid and unpaid leave.</P>
    <P>We are being told it is not a financial issue but a legal problem that is tying the hands of the Government. If that is so, I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of making a once off lump sum payment to those who are discriminated against as a result of the delay in introducing this order to extend paid and unpaid leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this announcement was made in the budget. However, the Government should not enter into a self-congratulatory mode or think that it is doing something wonderful. As Deputy Barnes pointed out, even with this small increase in paid and unpaid leave, we are still at the bottom of the league. We should be ashamed of ourselves.</P>
      <P>In a way, the Government is doing this for the wrong reasons. It is worried that women will have to leave the workforce and it wants them to stay in the workforce. It fears they will have to give up their jobs if they do not receive a decent amount of maternity leave.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this issue was examined by officials of the Department of Finance, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. How much did that cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did all this consultation since 6 December cost? The Government could have paid the women who went on maternity leave since the Budget Statement with the money it cost to carry out all that consultation. I started to inquire about this issue some weeks ago. One of my constituents rang me today, the husband of a woman who is pregnant and must give her notice by this Friday so she can benefit from the four weeks. She feared she might be disallowed. That man rang the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs five times before somebody copped onto the fact that he should ring the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I rang the Minister's office in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, left a message as to the subject of my inquiry and rang back again only to be told that they had just discovered it was not that Department's responsibility. I said: &ldquo;Are you not gravely embarrassed to have to tell me, a Deputy, that weeks after the announcement in the budget, you are only discovering that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for introducing the order? Where is the order and when will it be introduced?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;We do not know; the Department of Justice has to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 3.30 p.m. today, the same constituent whose wife must give her notice because her baby is due in March rang the Department of Social, Com<Col N="1308" /> munity and Family Affairs and got through to the maternity benefits section. This motion was tabled by the Government last Thursday but that man was told: &ldquo;We do not know what is happening about this; it might be another fortnight before we can tell you what is happening&rdquo;. That happened at 3.30 p.m. today. What were all these officials and the Ministers responsible for the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office doing? The information had not been transmitted to the section which any logical constituent would ring to find out whether their wives would benefit from these new arrangements. At 3.30 p.m. today the maternity section of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs did not know there was a motion before the House to introduce this arrangement, and they are the people who will have to implement the allocation of extra benefit to the women who will qualify for it. They are the people who will have to administer the extra benefit to qualifying women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make a clear and categorical statement on this matter to ensure that, if this order is approved here today and in the Seanad tomorrow or Thursday, I can tell the man who telephoned me that if his wife does not apply for her four weeks until Friday of this week after the motion has been signed into law, she can take her extra time and the additional unpaid leave when her four weeks are up in March? The Minister seemed to imply that the order's provisions would not come into effect until four weeks after it is signed. Can the four weeks of notice to the employer run from this week? This matter is crucial to women who are on the verge of making a decision and may be able to wait an extra day or two to give notice to their employers. It is essential that there would be no equivocation about their qualifications. Women are awaiting the outcome of this debate to see when they can give their four weeks' notice and I do not wish to see any of them being disenfranchised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that we must be conscious of the effect of this order on employers and that notice must be provided. Why should women be prevented from backdating their applications when any woman currently on paid maternity leave can now avail of four weeks' unpaid maternity leave? Employers will have to make arrangements for the extra time in any event if women decide to take an extra four weeks' unpaid leave. There is a flaw in the argument outlined by the Minister, and the Attorney General should be consulted again to see whether it is possible for women who are still on uncompleted paid maternity leave to add on the four weeks' paid leave. That is all we are looking for. I am <Col N="1309" /> confident the Minister of State will obtain that advice.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar seo, not by way of response as I understand that is not necessary but simply because of my own interest in the matter. I may be able to address some of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of paid maternity leave to 18 weeks, the extension of unpaid leave to eight weeks and the extension of adoptive leave to 14 weeks and eight weeks, paid and unpaid, respectively. These arrangements have not changed since 1981, a fact which reflects poorly on everyone who has been in Government since then.</P>
      <P>Women have waited a long time for this positive development which is very valuable for children in terms of the time they will spend with their mothers in their formative months. I am aware from my work with children with behavioural difficulties that children who have not had that attachment and bonding time can develop many difficulties in later years. This is a very worthwhile move from the perspective of the child and the family.</P>
      <P>The extended leave is also important in terms of women in the workforce. It recognises the increased numbers of women in the workforce and the additional challenges faced by families. People are torn from their children when the children are very young. Ireland is very low in the league table and it is only proper that we are taking steps to address that. People will no longer have to seek child care for very young children. It is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly in urban areas where there are fewer child minders than crèches, to find people willing to take children under a year old. If we can help to alleviate the pressure for women in any way, that is very worthwhile. The Government is spending £250 million and an additional £40 million in Exchequer funding on the provision of child care facilities, but allowing the mother to keep the child in his or her own home is the most family friendly option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of adoptive leave is hugely important, particularly in view of the fact that so many couples are obliged to go abroad for inter-country adoptions. Those people return to Ireland with children from different cultural <Col N="1310" /> backgrounds who may require special medical care or attention. It is crucial that adoptive parents can spend time with their children, many of whom are toddlers, when they return to this country.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will allow a non-controversial intervention as the time is running out. Will she clarify the issue I raised about whether a person can apply for the four weeks' leave from the date the order is signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming to that. The review of the Parental Leave Act is due at the end of this year and that will show how many employers provided paid leave as opposed to unpaid leave. Employers, too, must consider how they can develop family friendly policies.</P>
      <P>I, too, have received a number of phone calls on when the notice will take effect. Advertisements will be placed in the national press on Friday advising members of the public of what their exact entitlements are and when they will come into effect. I understand from my officials that the order's provisions will take effect four weeks after it is signed into law. The order is due to go before the Seanad on Thursday and will presumably be signed into law on Friday. I further understand that the extended period of maternity and adoptive leave will then apply to people commencing maternity or adoptive leave in early March, four weeks from the date of the order's signing. People will be able to take leave four weeks after serving notice to their employers. I reiterate that the advertisement due to be published in Friday's newspapers will clarify the position. I did not expect to have to answer this question this evening but I understand the above arrangements will apply.</P>

      <Col N="1311" />&ndash;aware that Article 15.10 of the Constitution enables each House of the Oireachtas to make its own rules and standing orders, with powers to attach penalties for their infringement, that such rules may extend to matters relating to the conduct and discipline of Members as well as the procedures of the House, but that rules of such a nature have yet to be adopted by this House;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Today my party is proposing, for the consideration of this House, a draft code of conduct for its Members which I hope will be adopted in principle by the House. I wish the House to embrace this motion because it affects us all. I welcome the Government's decision not to oppose it. The motion intends deliberately to give each and every Member of the House ownership of the proposed code of conduct. It is, in that sense, not partisan but it is all the more urgent and necessary for that. It is regrettable that once again Private Members' Business has had to be taken up to address this type of issue. Once again, the Government has been slow to act.</P>
      <P>What Labour wants by tomorrow is agreement that such a code is not just necessary but desirable. We want the House to decide in principle that what it advocates for others it is also prepared to consider for itself. We want an agreed timetable for its implementation and we want each party to have an input in agreeing the final wording of the code of conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks it has been clear that there has been growing all-party support for addressing the <Col N="1312" /> deficiencies in our existing practice. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, indicated to one Sunday newspaper that she intended bringing draft proposals before her parliamentary party. Deputy John Bruton, on behalf of Fine Gael, also suggested that it was appropriate that the House examine precisely this type of issue.</P>
    <P>A code such as this is necessary, particularly in light of recent events, to restore public confidence, or at least hope, in the integrity of the individual Members and to restore some degree of the respect and confidence society might properly place in Dáil Éireann as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to spend my time this evening reciting a list of the specific reasons such public confidence has been lost or to go into the details of specific cases. To a great extent, that was last week's business. We are all aware of what has been going on because each of these cases has involved a Member of this House and has, therefore, by necessary implication, concerned the operation of the institution we all belong to and from which we each derive our own democratic mandate.</P>
    <P>To the extent that any other Member's behaviour has damaged the reputation of the Dáil, it has damaged our ability to operate, and be seen to operate, impartially and with integrity as elected representatives. We are all, at this stage in the public mind, found guilty by association.</P>
    <P>It is time for us to take control of our affairs. There are some standards of practice already in place. Most are governed by the Ethics in Public Office Act of 1995 but they were formulated in the negative. They define what we should not do as much as what we should be doing. The point of a code of conduct, as is the case in other professions, is to establish an agreed set of standards to which we should all aspire.</P>
    <P>It is important that we also agree sanctions to address the knowing failure of a Member of this House to meet those standards. Let me be clear about that. Every Member is capable of inadvertently making small mistakes or not meeting standards. If and when the matter becomes clear, most will rush to put things right. The venial should not be used to excuse the mortal.</P>
    <P>There are Members who have deliberately and systematically sought to abuse the privileges that attach to membership of this House. The matter recently reached a head in a situation in which one of our number cited this House as a reason he should not co-operate fully with a tribunal established by all of us and, despite revulsion on all sides of the House, we were powerless to do anything about it. When the public expected action most, there was none and the Government, or one half of it anyway, was only too happy to hide behind the inadequate rules of this House. We, as Members of this House, are to some <Col N="1313" /> extent responsible because we, or our predecessors, failed at a much earlier date to put in place the sort of regime my party proposes tonight.</P>
    <P>If a code like this was in place much earlier, at least an awareness of what was considered to be acceptable behaviour, or behaviour liable to be found out, might have informed the behaviour of those who seem to consider themselves, as public representatives, immune from the considerations and obligations of the office they hold.</P>
    <P>I want to set out briefly what the draft code of conduct proposes. It deals with such matters as the obligation of TDs to uphold the law and to co-operate fully with the institutions of the State, including tribunals of inquiry; a requirement to avoid the improper use of any payment or allowance made to Members for public purposes; a requirement not to place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties; an obligation to perform their official duties and arrange their private affairs in a manner that will bear the closest legitimate public scrutiny; and a rule against making a statement in the House or its committees which is false or misleading in any material respect.</P>
    <P>Of itself, there is nothing to argue against in that. Every Member of Dáil Éireann would agree that their fellow Members should properly comply with such basic requirements. Why then is there the possibility of argument against it? The first reason is an entirely understandable one, which derives from a basic democratic principle. Elected representatives owe their primary responsibility to those who elect them. I entirely agree with that principle. I would vehemently object to the notion that persons elected to this House could be made subject to rules or codes which would oblige them to conform to a set of &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; rules that bore no relationship to the basis by which they were elected.</P>
    <P>To take some examples, perhaps in this context trivial but there is a reasonable fear that a code like this might give rise to trivial complaints, it is not a function of this House to adjudicate on whether a Member has behaved improperly by supporting or attending a blood sports event, by supporting or opposing the extradition of General Pinochet or by sending his or her children to a private school. There are two fundamental criteria, however, by which the behaviour of any elected representative should be judged and which this House, on behalf of the electorate as a whole, is entitled to examine.</P>
    <P>I quote, therefore, from the introduction of the draft code, referred to in the motion, where those two criteria are set out in full. It states: &ldquo;Individual members are not answerable to their colleagues for their behaviour, except where it is <Col N="1314" /> alleged to breach their duty to respect the law and institutions of the State, including the House itself, or to breach rules setting out steps that must be taken to reconcile private interests with public duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress my adherence to the assertion set out in the final paragraph of that draft introduction, that there are issues of judgment relating to our behaviour which are properly left to be decided by the electors, but when it comes to compliance with the law, which, after all, is the obligation of every citizen, and to telling the full truth to our electors about the reasons for the decisions we take, there can be no reason this House cannot proclaim these as fundamental duties to be performed by public representatives in the course of their duties. If an individual Member knowingly and consistently fails to comply with such basic requirements, I see no reason this House cannot note that fact and sanction that failure. The electorate as a whole demands nothing less.</P>
    <P>Second, many Members will possibly resent that we feel the need to put in place and articulate clearly standards that they adhere to in their everyday work. Some may feel that the code of conduct slights them in some respect, as if its very existence slights them. That is a viewpoint I understand, but we should not look at a code of conduct for ourselves in isolation, nor should we pretend that our profession is currently held in good order. As I stated earlier, part of the purpose behind tonight's motion is to assert clearly standards we believe should be lived up to.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators and as public representatives, increasingly question and decry the failure of other professional bodies and associations to police the standards that should properly be observed by their members. For example, we recently discussed a code of conduct for public servants. Why do we think we should be any different?</P>
    <P>We have done some preliminary research before introducing this draft code. Some aspects of it may remind Members of similar codes from other jurisdictions. I make no apology for that. First, because it brings home to us that we are very much behind the times on this question. We stand almost alone among countries with a similar parliamentary tradition, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, all of which have taken steps in recent years to improve the ability of their parliaments to police the behaviour of their public representatives. Second, because our first effort was to look at what we thought was best practice abroad and to adapt it for use at home.</P>
    <P>This is by no means our final view as to what must be in the code. I stress that our motion calls on the House to adopt in principle the notion that a code of conduct should be adopted and then refers this draft to the Committee on Members' <Col N="1315" /> Interests for its detailed consideration, not as a prescription but as a draft suggestion for consideration and amendment with an input from the other political parties and individual Members of the House. The Committee on Members' Interests seemed to us to be the appropriate body despite its small size. It has already had experience of dealing with complaints under the Ethics in Public Office Act and we all agree that it has done so carefully and diligently. The ability of this committee to act in a non-partisan fashion vindicates the argument I am making that we can operate a code of conduct among each other without succumbing to party political point scoring.</P>
    <P>To deal with some of what are admittedly complex constitutional and legal arguments that may be claimed to arise &ndash; but none of which I believe arise in this context &ndash; I will set out my understanding of the situation. The first part of Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that each House of the Oireachtas shall make its own rules and standing orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement. However, the only rules or standing orders of any practical significance made by this House since its establishment are the Standing Orders that govern public business. They deal with procedural matters &ndash; how many Stages a Bill should have, and so on. The only penalty ever attached for breach of those rules relate to disorderly behaviour in the House &ndash; disobedience to a ruling from the Chair. During most of the time since 1937 we have made do with standing orders which are largely confined to setting out rules for debate in the Chamber and which do not attempt to regulate any misbehaviour other than &ldquo;disorderly conduct&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In essence, these are the rules of a debating society, governing the procedure of debate, and they punish Members who defy the rules, but only by expelling them from the debate. I have no doubt, having been advised by those who have studied the 1967 report of the Committee on the Constitution, with whose views the Constitutional Review Group, reporting in 1996, had no disagreement, that, whatever difficulty there may be in interpreting the second part of Article 15.10, the first part empowers each House of the Oireachtas to deal with internal matters both of procedure and of the discipline of its Members.</P>
    <P>I stress that I am not including here as a disciplinary punishment the question of expulsion of a Member by vote of the House. However much I and others may on a recent specific occasion have felt it necessary or appropriate to call on another Member voluntarily to resign his seat, I have not ever called for, and do not now call for, a situation whereby a majority of the Members of Dáil Éireann could effectively decide upon the composition of the House by claiming a power to expel those with whom they have a disagreement, <Col N="1316" /> no matter how serious the issue. There is all the difference in the world between the moral sanction of a statement of the collective opinion of ones peers and a legal sanction which has legal effect in accordance with its own terms. I would welcome hearing the views of other Members on this matter. As of now I am of the view that the ultimate sanction should be left to the electors in this Republic. However, this is not to say that a range of alternative sanctions, which fall short of expulsion, should not be put in place.</P>
    <P>During the Labour Party's last period in Government we supplemented the Dáil Standing Orders with the Ethics in Public Office Act, which governs the disclosure of interests by TDs. By virtue of the means by which that Act came into operation, it effectively has become a rule of the House. Yet the fact is that the Ethics in Public Office Act, while a necessary step, was only a first step. Certainly, it dealt with issues which many Members of the House at that time considered to be intensely private, but it dealt with those issues only on the basis of a duty to disclose interests. It made no rules for the avoidance of conflicts of interest or on the basis of a requirement to behave ethically in the case of a conflict of interest. In retrospect, I have some sympathy with the Parliamentary Counsel who wanted to entitle the Bill the &ldquo;Registration of Interests Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For all of that, I repeat the claim that the passage of that Act was a necessary step but also only a first step. The fact remains that more than 60 years after the Constitution was enacted we still have no comprehensive code of conduct in place which sets out in an ethical framework the standards of acceptable behaviour which the public is entitled to expect of its representatives. Unless standards are enshrined as rules we are powerless to act when those standards are breached. Penalties cannot be applied unless rules have been broken and, therefore, the public looks at us amazed when we say there is nothing we can do because we have no rules in force that we can say have been broken. The result is that Members of the Dáil, acting collectively, can do nothing when one of their number by his or her conduct brings the House and all its Members into disrepute. Such a failure to act can only add further to public disillusionment with the institution in which we serve.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that most Members of the Dáil acknowledge they have a responsibility to maintain the public trust placed in them by performing their duties with honesty and integrity, by respecting the law and the institutions of the State and by using their influence solely to advance the common good. It is precisely because most of us share these aims that we must be in a position to act to ensure the protection of these values.</P>
    <P>I am not offering this code as the last word on the matter or on a take it or leave it basis. That is why I am proposing that the Dáil should first <Col N="1317" /> approve in principle the adoption of a draft code along these lines. The Dáil would then refer the draft for detailed consideration in committee and should be in a position to adopt a final package as soon as the committee reports. What is at issue here is the competence and capacity of Dáil Éireann to act &ndash; not in substitution for any other body, but in exercising the entitlement of any domestic forum &ndash; to police standards of ethical behaviour it imposes on its Members. The Constitution anticipates as much and the public is entitled to nothing less.</P>
    <P>I expect the House to support this motion. Failure to do so would send out a terrible message to the public. In those circumstances what we have approached as a non-party political matter would become a party political matter. That is not what I want. The onus is on the Government. I welcome its support for the principle of the motion and am happy to accept its amendment. I look forward to its support in ensuring that the House's instructions thereafter, particularly in relation to the timetable agreed, are delivered upon.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús báire, tá an Comhaontas Glas ag tacú leis an rún seo agus go bhfios dom tá na páirtithe eile chomh maith. Fáiltimid roimhe sin. There is no doubt about the need for a code of conduct in politics, particularly in parliamentary politics. Society in general has been crying out for such a code. It is not just a case of keeping track of misdemeanours and ensuring compliance with the laws we as the Legislature make in this House but also of recognising that democracy itself is in need of protection if it is not to give way to a culture of total populism and image towards which the types of scandals we have been witnessing and talked about here last week are leading us.</P>
      <P>From the Green Party's point of view, the coverage of the tribunals and the scandals which are emerging, which was debated here at length last week, is only one of the many reasons we need the code of conduct proposed by the Labour Party tonight. It is often said that the Irish public is passionate about politics, and that is evident from the readership of newspapers and their familiarity with politics, even if that is often in the context of public houses. People's interest in politics goes back for many generations. Although that interest, that passion, is now being turned into a negative interest, often described as cynicism, it is still an interest. It just happens to be expressed in very negative terms. I hope this code of conduct will help, even if only in a small way, to turn that cynicism back into a positive interest and passion for politics once more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of that process is to ensure that the necessary monitoring of procedures are in place and that they are the right procedures. In formulating a code of conduct we must look not just at <Col N="1318" /> whether the code is being complied with but at whether procedures are effective or need to be changed and made more effective.</P>
    <P>With that in mind I was interested in the Ombudsman's proposal to have a code of conduct for the public service in general. That is something with which I am sure we would all agree. However, that should lead one to look beyond that to parliamentary matters. I hope we can take on board the idea of appointing a parliamentary ombudsman as some other countries have. A parliamentary ombudsman would be an independent institution which would ensure a level of objectivity in handling complaints against or by Members. Although all of us would plead that the bodies set up to deal with transgressions by Members are objective, the system appears to be very much of an in-house arrangement and that sends out the wrong messages in regard to the objectivity of the work that is being carried out.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a parliamentary ombudsman to deal with the effectiveness of procedures, in this House particularly and in the Houses of the Oireachtas in general. For example, we have for many years discussed the idea of reforming the voting system in the House by introducing electronic voting, but very little has been done about it. One issue is of particular concern to me. That is the use of Irish in the House. There seems to be a reluctance on the part of Members to use what appear on television to be quite cumbersome headphones. It would be a simple matter to have small earphones so that Members would not feel they were making a statement either by wearing or not wearing them. Another issue of concern to me and, I am sure, to other Members of smaller parties is the speaking arrangements for smaller parties which, I am glad to say, are working out well tonight but which, unfortunately, do not always work the same way.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> the journalist, Emily O'Reilly, whom I have heard speaking on this matter before, mentions that the procedures in this House make things extremely difficult for any family, particularly for women in primary child care roles. Given that 1 March is family workplace day, we in this House should try to lead by example, even though our hours are very anti-social. There is no doubt that this is part of a wider issue which it is important to address if we are to deal not just with the symptoms of malaise evidenced in the scandals but the wider issue of making politics relevant, attractive and effective for Irish society in 2001. That is to focus on parliamentary work. However, it has been noted by people observing politics over many years that the dirtiest politics goes on internally in parties. That is a message that carries into society that is generally not flagged too often in this House by the parties, for the sake of maintaining unity and, perhaps, even camaraderie.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the parties trying to deflect attention from themselves by interjecting will find it interesting that the parliamentary ombudsman idea should be more broadly based to encompass more of a political ombudsman, in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has some questions to answer in that regard in the context of his fundraising role in Fianna Fáil, which was well flagged on the Order of Business in the past few days. Since we will be reviewing the freedom of information legislation in October, it might be important, as we extend the remit of the freedom of information legislation, to look at its extension to political parties because organisations which come under the banner of being private and voluntary and which receive State funding have to account for themselves. If State funding is involved, organisations should be made to account fully.</P>
      <P>In 1984, when the media started to look at the Conservative Party in the UK, Lord Keith Joseph told them to take a running jump by describing the organisation as a private voluntary organisation whose finances were nobody's business. However, it is different when State funding is involved. Then it is important to have accountability. If we are to restore confidence in the political system, accountability is the bottom line. Freedom of information legislation should be in the context of that code of conduct so that we do not just look at the transgressions and the scandals, the things which make the headlines in the newspapers given that they focus on personalities, and that tends to be what makes newspapers sell, but that we use the opportunity to transform the political system so that it will be more attractive, more effective and more relevant to the society in which we all live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to second the motion by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Quinn, that the House ought to adopt a code of conduct for its Members. I welcome also the acceptance by the Government of the Labour Party motion, with a minor amendment. I regret the Government did not recognise it was its job in the first place to bring forward such a measure. The Labour Party has not tabled this motion tonight because collectively or individually we are better than any other party or Member, but because the diminution in the standing of this House demands that whatever reasonable <Col N="1320" /> measures can be taken to restore public confidence in politics ought to be taken. It seems there is a necessity to restore public respect for this House and to restore confidence in the honour of its Members.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn said, I do not propose to go over the individual events that gave rise to the necessity for this. They have been well trailed elsewhere. Whether or not we like it every Member has been diminished somewhat by association. That is the verdict of the public. We have not ever in the history of politics got such uniformly bad press. One would get the impression from some of the public commentary that this place and the country is swimming in corruption. That, manifestly, is not true. One can still count on the fingers of one hand the number of Members since 1922 who have been involved in bringing politics and this House into disrepute. Nonetheless, the perception is real. The obligation is on us to restore confidence as best we can, to hope that what we are going through is a phase, that it will prove cathartic and that we can put this behind us after a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>There will always be lapses from high standards to which we aspire or ought to aspire. The purpose of this code is not to exact penalties for minor unintentional errors. All Members will recognise a major lapse when they see it. The House has attracted ridicule in the recent past and opprobrium for its Members because of our seeming inability to deal with this kind of issue. Only last year a Member who was banished for 15 days was the cause of ridicule being piled on Dáil Éireann and associations with the rest of us that were unworthy and unjustified at the time because of the rules that govern the House and the legislation that applied in that case. As matters stand, we do not have authority to deal with this kind of situation. Deputy Quinn adverted to the fact that neither he nor this motion seeks to encroach on the nature of the sovereign relationship that exists between the people and the Members, but we ought to have more than the existing Standing Orders to govern the relationship as between the House and the manner in which we are seen outside it.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that one can be expelled from this House for making an accusation that someone is misleading it, but I cannot recall a Member being suspended for having misled the House, and the House has been misled. Only in the immediate days past, a Deputy from Dublin West was barred from the House and denied the right to speak for, what might be termed, a procedural misdemeanour, but another Member, under privilege of the House, was free to use a scatter-gun effect on all other Members to divert attention from his predicament. That cannot be right and we must address that situation. The Labour Party seeks to do no more than that in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The purpose of the code is not to inhibit political expression. We are not trying to penalise difference, non-conformism or even eccentricity. If the people of Limerick East want to send the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, back to this House to keep making funny speeches, we must fully recognise their right, however misguided, to continue to do that. That is not the purpose of this measure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn said, there will be some Members who feel we are already sufficiently constrained by various rules and regulations contained in, for example, the Ethics in Public Office Act. Members will have received a form today or yesterday requesting the completion of declarations of interests, property and so on, and there are various other rules and regulations that apply for which we have got little credit in public. One could say the same about the Freedom of Information Act. It is used, quite properly, by the media from time to time to ascertain the expenses of Members, a request for 2000 being the latest one, although my memory is that we have given that information to members of the media three or four times already, but they want somebody in the employ of the State to do the sums for them, to calculate it over 12 months because it is difficult to put it together three times in a year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that we do not get any credit for that, it is up to us to renovate the legislation and procedures governing the House as best we can and for the reason that nothing could be more important. I anticipate that Members on the opposite side will say the Labour Party could have found something more important to debate in their Private Members' time. Nothing could be more important than the respect with which this House is held and the manner in which we go about and are seen to go about our work by the people who sent us here in the first place.</P>
    <P>There are other matters we would like to table on the Order of Business, but for some reason the Government is backward in coming forward on that type of issue. A certain paralysis seems to infect it when it comes to dealing with that issue. For example, I was looking at an amendment the Government tabled to a motion introduced by the Labour Party prior to the summer recess in respect of which the Taoiseach promised to introduce legislation to deal with the question of lobbyists, standards in public office, whistleblowing and a number of other matters. The standards in public office Bill has got lost and the other matters have not yet seen the light of day.</P>
    <P>In that situation, we have to come forward with this legislation, but we would prefer to be dealing with the substance of this issue, which is the suspicion that private money can buy public men. Until we deal with that issue and the issue of corporate donations, something along the lines suggested by the Labour Party, which is neither prescriptive nor absolute, that suspicion &ndash; arising <Col N="1322" /> from what has happened in recent decades and has been excavated at the tribunals outside this House &ndash; that public men or their decisions can be bought by private money will continue to haunt this House. It is not a reply for the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to say what he said yesterday; I do not know whether it was an exclusive interview with the <i>Irish Independent</i> or a considered press release. His response seems to be two-fold, that the Labour Party overspent on recent by-elections and that for the public to fund politics would cost between £5 million and £6 million. How can he say that with a straight face? The £5 million or £6 million to fund politics in this country would not buy the corner flags in the Bertie bowl stadium.</P>

      <P>It is not at all a strange analogy. The Government is prepared to spend £800 million on that project while £5 million or £6 million would fund politics in this country and remove us from the suspicion that underlies this and many other debates. That would be a small price to pay.</P>
      <P>Claims were made about the Labour Party spending £257.62, mistakenly and unknowingly, in the Dublin South Central by-election. The commission found the agent did not knowingly cause an overspend to occur and the amount of the overspend was immaterial. A similar conclusion was reached in the Dublin North case. This is the first time the legislation has been tried and throwing this back and forth, as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs did in some form of rebuttal of our substantive case, will not wash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and in supporting the principles included in the proposed code of conduct before the House and its referral to the Committee on Members' Interests, further instructs the committee that it has power to draft a code of conduct consistent with that envisaged in the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, and to consider submissions from Oireachtas Members and political parties, including the proposed code before the House. &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given what Deputies Quinn, Sargent and Rabbitte have said, we all accept this is an important issue and one which we want to deal with. We have been doing so for some time under various headings and in various legislative measures. This House has provided good service to the State for nearly eight decades and in that time we have always been able to rely on the integrity, propriety and good sense of Members and public ser<Col N="1323" /> vants. We have relied for the proper performance of our democracy more on their sense of duty and public service than on formal rules and codes. Our reliance has, with few exceptions, not been misplaced. We are now faced, however, with a growing desire on the part of Members for the development of a code of conduct. Indeed, we in Fianna Fáil have already acted upon this. Last year we developed a code of principles in public life and instituted our standards in public life committee. We were the first party to institute such a code providing written guidelines and principles for officeholders and candidates with a view to supporting the highest ethical standards within Irish public life.</P>
    <P>This desire for a code of conduct for all parliamentarians was noted in the responses of the appropriate Oireachtas committee to outline Government proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill. It was again apparent in the responses of Members of relevant committees to the published Bill and is underlined by the fact that we are discussing this topic. I do not see this growing demand as an admission of failure or as a reflection on the generally high standards of behaviour and exceptional commitment to the public interest apparent in the House, and previous speakers have rightly acknowledged that. It is rather a response to a rapidly changing, ever more complex society and to the demands of a modern democracy. If there was one word to describe the development of government and administrative systems around the world in the past decade it would perhaps be accountability. That word encompasses the concepts of responsibility, clarity of roles and openness in the performance of one's functions. A response to a world which has become increasingly complex has been to seek to control the complexity through ensuring that people in public life are increasingly clear about their individual roles, about their personal responsibilities within those roles and through making the affairs of such persons increasingly visible to members of the public.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, the Public Service Management Act and the Freedom of Information Act, all referred to previously, as well as the legislation on compellability of witnesses before Oireachtas committees, the Electoral Acts and legislation relating to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General are the most obvious examples of how these concepts are being reflected in our laws and thinking. However, it would be difficult to find legislation over the past decade in relation to any part of the apparatus of the State which did not reflect this trend.</P>
    <P>I have special responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act, which Deputy Rabbitte referred to, and it is a particular feature of the trend towards greater transparency in government. The <Col N="1324" /> Act has ensured that members of the public directly, through journalists, as was said earlier, through special interest groups or through Members are in a public way to be informed about the inner workings of Government and State bodies. We as politicians are increasingly doing our business in the light of this legislation. The public is more aware of our activity and we are more aware of each other's activities than heretofore. Over time we and the public will benefit from this transparency.</P>
    <P>I am working hard to ensure that the positive changes in the culture of the public service which have been reinforced by this legislation are underpinned and extended. I am also anxious we continue the ongoing programme of extensions of the Freedom of Information Act, which has characterised our approach over the past three years. Almost 30,000 freedom of information requests have been received since the Act commenced in April 1998. Thousands of members of the public have received unprecedented access to public records, very often regarding the treatment of their individual cases. However, more than half the requests are for non-personal information and are made by journalists, business people Members and other members of the public. Hundreds of newspaper articles are written every year based on information disclosed under the Act. Over the next few weeks I expect to seek Oireachtas approval for the next phase of extensions to bodies in the industrial development sector in particular. I am also consulting with Departments about further extensions thereafter.</P>
    <P>None of the legislation I have mentioned will in themselves change the nature of our governmental system. Each one is an incremental step but taken together they form a substantial programme of change, supported over the years by all parties. We are continuing with this work, as we must. These legislative initiatives have done much to ensure that members of the public know how the organs of the State conduct business on their behalf, but the public continues, rightly, to demand the highest standards of transparency and probity from public servants and public organisations. It is apparent that there is considerable work to be done in maintaining public confidence in Government and in persons in public life. That confidence must be supported by appropriate structures, legislation and rules for the conduct of public business and public servants and representatives and by high standards of public integrity and probity among those public servants and representatives.</P>
    <P>We all know from experience that a few people with low personal standards can undermine and weaken our democratic institutions and we all share a desire to reform the system we work in to reinforce these institutions. It was with this in mind that the Taoiseach made a substantial statement in December regarding the Government's <Col N="1325" /> approach to this reform process. A number of legislative initiatives are currently under way in this regard. For example, it is the intention of the Government that politicians and candidates for election will be required to maintain separate accounts for political donations and that all such donations be channelled through such accounts. As part of an overall modernising and tightening of anti-corruption legislation, amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Bill will allow for an inference of guilt to be drawn from failure to adhere to the proper arrangements in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, whistleblower legislation will provide for protection for persons who bring to light breaches of the law in public and other bodies. Protection will also be provided for persons who report corruption or who make complaints to the proposed standards in public office commission. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working to develop legislation for the registration of lobbyists and for greater transparency in their activity. Deputy Rabbitte can take that as being the position as it stands. We want to bring this before the House as quickly as possible and the work is under way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is bringing forward legislation to ensure greater probity and transparency in the operation of local authorities and the planning process, while the Minister for Finance has published the Standards in Public Office Bill and is working on a number of amendments to it on foot of the work done by various Oireachtas committees over the summer recess. I will deal with some of these issues in more detail later.</P>
    <P>In relation to political donations, there is now a transparent regime for disclosure of donations which applies to political parties, Oireachtas Members, MEPs and councillors. Each political party and each Member of the Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament is required to furnish to the Public Offices Commission each year a donation statement indicating whether any donation exceeding a specified value was received during the previous year. Unsuccessful candidates are also obliged to furnish a donation statement within 56 days of polling day. The specified value for disclosure is £4,000 in the case of a political party and £500 in the case of a Deputy, Senator and MEP. Particulars of any such donation must be given as well as details of the person by, or on whose behalf, the donation was made.</P>
    <P>In addition, companies, trade unions and certain other bodies are also required to disclose certain donations in their annual reports. Any individual donor who makes donations to several members of the same political party in the same year which, in aggregate, exceed £4,000 is required to make a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission. Anonymous <Col N="1326" /> donations in excess of £100 are not permitted and, if received, must be remitted to the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>Similarly, at local authority level, legislation was introduced by the Government in 1999 requiring disclosure of donations over £500 and expenditure in respect of candidates in the local elections. Part 15 of the Local Government Bill, 2000, provides for an ethical framework for the local government service and includes provision for an annual written declaration of interests by councillors and staff; a public register of interests; disclosure of interest in any matter which arises in the course of a person's duties in which he or she or a connected person is involved; and a requirement to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.</P>
    <P>While this body of legislation provides a sound framework for the conduct of politics and public affairs, the Government is not standing still on this issue. As I mentioned, the Taoiseach announced in December that the Government will introduce further measures in relation to political donations. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will, therefore, introduce amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, to require every public representative to deposit donations received for political purposes into a special account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. This requirement will also apply to political parties at all levels and it will be an offence not to pay money so donated into such an account. In addition, public representatives will have to certify on an annual basis that all donations were lodged in that account and were used for legitimate political purposes.</P>
      <P>Further amendments to the Bill will introduce limits on the amount an individual candidate or public representative or political party can receive from one source in any given year. The amount of a donation any political party can receive from a single source in any given year shall be limited to £20,000. The amount any individual public representative or candidate can receive from a single source in any given year shall be limited to £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage, aims to combat bribery and corruption by updating earlier anti-corruption legislation. The measures in the Bill will root out corrupt behaviour and impose severe penalties on those found guilty of offences under it. The Bill will also enable Ireland to ratify a number of important conventions dealing with corruption drawn up by the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OECD. This will ensure that our laws against corruption <Col N="1327" /> and the penalties for infringements are among the most stringent and that they will apply to the private and public sectors alike.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the categories of persons who will be subject to its provisions will be wide, including employees of public bodies, Members of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, judges and any other person employed or acting on behalf of the public administration of the State. It will also apply to members of the Government and national or regional parliaments of any other state, a Member of the European Parliament, European Court of Auditors and European Commission, foreign public prosecutors and judges and judges of any international court established by agreement to which Ireland is a party. It also includes employees of international bodies and foreign administrations. It is a most comprehensive list.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it an offence for such a person, or any other person, to corruptly accept or obtain, or agree to accept or attempt to obtain, whether for personal benefit or for someone else's benefit, any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement or reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her position. It will also be an offence for any person to corruptly give, agree to give or offer any gift or consideration for the like purpose. Indirect corruption, for example, where one person receives a benefit with the intention of influencing the person who has authority to exercise certain functions, will also be an offence.</P>
    <P>The increasing complexity of international business and the opening up of national economies should not result in opportunities to avoid prosecution for offences involving corruption. Accordingly, the Bill provides that a person may be tried in Ireland for the offence of corruption once any element of the offence took place within the State. It also contains a new offence of corruption in office aimed at any act or omission by the office holder done with the intention of corruptly obtaining a gift, consideration or other advantage either for himself or herself or any other person. Furthermore, it provides that responsibility for an offence of corruption by a body corporate can be attributed, where appropriate, to certain of its officers and/or members. In this way, individuals as well as the body corporate can be held liable for the offence. This would cover instances where individuals within a body corporate can contribute to such offences whether directly by consenting to or conniving with the commission of an offence or by wilful neglect of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of the Government's intolerance of those who fall below the high standards which we demand of those in public life, the Bill provides that the penalty to be imposed on those <Col N="1328" /> convicted on indictment of an offence of corruption will be either an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>In response to the Taoiseach's December initiative, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, outlined a number of measures to further strengthen the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill. These are provision for a presumption that a public representative has acted corruptly where there are proceedings in being for an offence of corruption and where it is proved that the public representative has failed to disclose a political donation as required by law and has acted such that the donor receives a benefit; provision for a presumption that a public official has acted corruptly where there are proceedings in being for an offence of corruption and where there is proof that the person received money or other benefit from another person who had an interest in the way certain functions were exercised by the public official; provision for immunity from civil liability for persons who report, reasonably and in good faith, suspicions of corruption; and provision for the granting of search warrants for the proper investigation of offences of corruption. Taken with the other measures proposed by the Government, these will contribute significantly to ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, is currently progressing legislation relating to persons who, in an employment context, reveal otherwise confidential information in the public interest. This will be done by way of amendment to an existing Labour Party Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>In putting the motion into context, we should consider in particular the Standards in Public Office Bill and the impact it will have in ensuring greater integrity in the political and administrative systems. Before dealing with the issue of codes of conduct directly, I wish to describe the contents of the Bill in relation to complaints about breaches of ethical standards among Members and office holders. This is relevant to the motion.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill provides for the establishment of a new Standards in Public Office Commission. This commission will take on all the current functions of the Public Offices Commission. In addition, however, it will have wide investigative powers in relation to complaints about persons in public life, for example, the case of a Minister or other office holder, or a public servant, in relation to whom a complaint is made concerning what the legislation refers to as a &ldquo;specified act&rdquo;. A specified act is an act or omission of such a person which is inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the <Col N="1329" /> relevant position or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance.</P>
    <P>To be a specified act, the matter complained of must be of significant public importance. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the full rigours of a commission investigation will be used in relation to minor matters. Generally, in deciding whether to investigate a complaint, it will be a matter for the commission to decide whether it deems a matter to be of significant public importance, but it may deem a matter to be significant if it relates to a benefit or potential benefit allegedly received by a person where the value exceeds £10,000. The commission will have the services of an inquiry officer to make preliminary inquiries in relation to a complaint so as to establish whether a full investigation is warranted. This screening process should ensure that frivolous and vexatious complaints are dealt with appropriately, but there should be no doubt that the Standards in Public Office Commission will have very significant powers. Its very existence should help to ensure appropriate standards of behaviour by persons in public life.</P>
    <P>As reflected in the motion before us tonight, however, Members of the Oireachtas have a special constitutional status. For that reason it is not intended that the Standards in Public Office Commission will receive complaints regarding Members of the Oireachtas, other than office holders, directly from the public. Complaints about Members regarding specified acts will be received by the Clerk of the relevant House. The Clerk can do some initial screening of frivolous and vexatious complaints, but generally complaints will be passed on to the Committee on Members' Interests and it will be a matter for it to consider the complaint. However, the committee will, if it so wishes, have the option to pass a matter to the commission and thereby use the commission as its agent in investigating a complaint. This is an important point. In that way, the Standards in Public Office Bill will give substantial underpinning to the role of the Committee on Members' Interests in ensuring appropriate behaviour among Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill also makes provision for tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas and others. Persons elected will be required to make a statutory declaration of tax compliance, and the making of a false declaration will be an offence. They will also have to produce a tax clearance certificate. There will, therefore, be considerable policing of tax compliance of Members.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the Standards in Public Office Bill's proposals regarding codes of conduct. The importance of the standards Bill in this regard is that it provides not only for the development of a code of conduct for Oireachtas Members, office holders and other public ser<Col N="1330" /> vants but that it does so in the framework of an overall investigative mechanism.</P>
    <P>A code of conduct under the standards in public Office Bill will indicate standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the person to whom it relates. A person covered by a code of conduct will be expected to have regard to the code in the course of the performance of his or her duties and to be guided by it. Where appropriate, a code of conduct will be admissible and can be taken into account in court proceedings or in proceedings before the Committee on Members' Interest of the relevant House, or by a tribunal or the Standards in Public Office Commission. This means that a code of conduct under the Standards in Public Office Bill is to be a substantive and important document, and the persons to whom it relates must regard it as such.</P>
    <P>As regards Members of the Oireachtas in particular, the Bill provides that the code of conduct for Members, other than Ministers and other office holders, will be drawn up by the Standards in Public Office Commission, in consultation with the relevant Committee on Members' Interests. This treatment is in line with what was suggested in a report of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service regarding the Government's original outline proposals for the standards Bill. Given the special constitutional status of the Oireachtas, the code of conduct would not, however, have effect in relation to either House of the Oireachtas in the absence of a resolution of the relevant House bringing it into force. Indeed, the Bill as a whole will not have effect regarding the Oireachtas until a resolution is passed.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that it has been suggested in meetings of Oireachtas committees in relation to the standards Bill that it would be more appropriate that the code of conduct be drafted by Members and that the commission be involved only in a consultative capacity. I would agree with this view and I understand that the Minister for Finance intends to bring forward appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The motion we are considering tonight, however, gives not even a consultative role to the proposed commission. This is not surprising, of course, since the Standards in Public Office Commission does not yet exist as such but, given its proposed investigative role and the fact that it will also be consulted in the drafting of codes of conduct for office holders and public servants, it would seem appropriate to provide for consultation regarding the Oireachtas Members' codes also. I am sure Deputy Quinn would probably agree with that. That is, I think, what he meant by putting all this to the committee to see what comes out of it, but the strength of the Bill I have been outlining is that it will marry many substantive and fundamental issues. Such consultation does not bind the Oireachtas in any way nor does <Col N="1331" /> it prevent the work on a code from commencing, in anticipation of the passing of the Bill and the establishment of the commission. Indeed, the Bill already provides for the possibility that a code will be in place before its passage and where it is considered adequate to meet the provisions of the Bill, the pre-existing code need not be superseded. That makes that point clear.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from my in-depth description above that the Standards in Public Office Bill contains very significant provisions regarding the behaviour not only of office holders and public servants but also of Oireachtas Members. That Bill will progress through the usual Stages, and the Government is anxious that Members will consider it in depth and contribute to its improvement, where appropriate, on Committee Stage, but it should also be apparent that the drafters of the code of conduct must have regard to the shape and contents of the Bill as it stands. The investigative structures, the mechanisms for handling complaints and the general standards provided for in the Bill, as well as the provisions proposed regarding office holders and public servants generally, must all form a part of the necessary considerations in drafting the code of conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the Government wishes to amend the motion. The intention is not to stifle or inhibit this House and one of its committees in exercising its prerogatives under Article 15.10. Indeed, it is clear from the wording of our amendment that the Government supports the principles underpinning the proposed code. However, no code of conduct should be drafted without regard to the context in which it will operate and the Standards in Public Office Bill will form a more important part of that context than is perhaps reflected in the motion and draft code as it stands.</P>
    <P>It may be worthwhile to consider what makes a good code of conduct. As I have already noted, the Standards in Public Office Bill provides that the proposed code will indicate standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the person to whom it relates. A person covered by a code of conduct will be expected to have regard to the code in the course of the performance of his or her duties and to be guided by it in the performance of his or her functions. The code of conduct, therefore, should be drafted in such a way that it will form a reference point for Members, providing them with greater certainty at moments when they may have to grapple with difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>In providing this basic reference point, a good code of conduct will foster trust in the institutions of Parliament and, taken together with all the other initiatives under way, reinforce public confidence that public representatives navigate through difficult passages guided by a reliable ethical compass. Members themselves will be <Col N="1332" /> reassured that there is a common set of standards provided by the code and that they can be entitled to expect their colleagues to respect those standards.</P>
    <P>It is important, of course, that a code of conduct be clear and capable of being operated and that it should be operated in a transparent and impartial fashion. Tonight we are taking a small step towards the development of a sounder system of government in our country. In years to come, such small steps may be more telling than many grand gestures.</P>
    <P>As regards the draft code itself, as put before us tonight, there is of course much to be applauded in it. I do not propose to go through the Labour Party draft code on a paragraph by paragraph basis; that is precisely the kind of work that a committee should do. However, I will say that Members on all sides are likely to have views on the content of a code of conduct, and there are examples of such codes in other jurisdictions which might also be worthy of consideration. The committee will be able to consider in detail the draft code appended to this motion and will also be able to take into account other suggestions and proposals from committee members.</P>
    <P>I note from Deputy Quinn's published statement regarding this motion that he is not &ldquo;claiming any monopoly of wisdom in regard to the provisions that should be included&rdquo; in a code of conduct and that he is happy to have the issue of a code submitted to the Committee on Members' Interests for wider consideration. I am sure, therefore, that the Deputy will be pleased to find that the Government is happy to ask the committee to draft a code of conduct and that he and his colleagues will accept what I believe is a sensible Government amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance believes it would be good to appoint a former politician of good standing to the commission. That would bring to the commission a particular perspective and the experience of what it is like to operate in public life which would be of benefit to it. It is a provision all of us in the House would welcome.</P>
    <P>That brings into perspective and context in great depth and detail all the Labour Party motion has set out to do but also recognises that there is a collective will in the House to move forward. No specific element of it stands on any specific moral ground. The Government is very committed to this and we have demonstrated that we have delivered. Much more remains to be done but we can move on collectively in this regard.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael supports in principle the establishment of a code of conduct for persons in public life. Accordingly, we are glad to support the Labour Party motion and we are also glad that it has put the principle centre stage and has given us a draft which contains ideas as to what should be included in such a code of conduct.</P>
      <P>The first thing that should be said is what a code of conduct will not do. Like other Members, I have been horrified by recent revelations of what appears to amount to corrupt practices on the part of some Members. Having a code of conduct will not prevent such practices. On the other hand, it would serve as a useful reference point for Members as to what behaviour is acceptable and it would be a standard by which to measure a person's actions. In that situation it would be considerably broader than purely criminal matters or matters already covered by the Ethics in Public Office Act. I agree with the point that the scope of any code should not extend to personal behaviour. Therefore, I envisage that the ethics committee would have a role in censuring Members for non-criminal action, such as breaching the proposed code of conduct.</P>
      <P>That gives rise to two points. There is a danger of Members going overboard on the issue of a code of conduct. There is no need for the vast majority of Members to put on sackcloth and ashes as regards their conduct as Members of the House. I have been a Member for a number of years and I have learned during that time that almost every Member with whom I have come in contact has carried out his or her duties to the highest standards of integrity. That is what I would expect. I do not say that as a compliment to them. That should be the normal standard for people in the House. The fact that the profession of politics has been besmirched recently to some degree by a few bad apples should not affect the position of ordinary Members who are not affected by such conduct or who do not involve themselves or indulge in such conduct.</P>
      <P>However, the other side of the coin is that, where it is proved that Members have not adhered to these ordinary, not high, standards, we should establish procedures whereby real penalties are put in place. My approval for a code of conduct is dependent to some degree on ensuring that breaches are examined and investigated fairly and, if found to exist, result in real penalties. I found as a member of the Committee on Members' Interests that, in considering issues brought before it, it was constrained by the Act, the range of penalties under which is very limited. My strongest recommendation is that that range of penalties should be extended considerably in any amendment to the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That raises a further issue as to the Committee on Members' Interests. The current system for nominating people to the committee should also <Col N="1334" /> be examined. One of the nominees of the Government to the committee subsequently resigned, that nominee being Deputy Lawlor. It is not my business to point the finger at any individual, but I use it to highlight the point about the manner in which a committee of the House is selected. I am not sure that the nomination to such a committee by party leaders is the correct way to put such a committee together. There is a case for some procedure involving all Members proposing and agreeing the appointment of senior and trusted Members to such a committee rather than the existing procedure of leaving nominations to party leaders which, in my experience, has left something to be desired.</P>
    <P>I quibble with the motion on one point and do so as a member of the committee which is expected to return to the House with recommendations by 1 May. I question whether that is feasible. I say that in the context of the fact that the Committee on Members' Interests is dealing with a specific complaint which is taking up a great deal of its time and also in the context of the serious difficulties other jurisdictions have had in agreeing codes of conduct. It is fine in principle to go along with the notion of a code of conduct but, as has often been mentioned in other areas, the devil can be in the detail.</P>
    <P>I, with my colleagues, Deputies Browne and Howlin, and others, had the opportunity to examine the code of conduct in Australia. It has different jurisdictions in the form of the different states. I recall the investigations in New South Wales where there had been considerable allegations of corruption. They spent some years producing enormous tomes and reports on this issue with very detailed, complicated and specific codes drafted and laid down. I am concerned that, if we follow the same process here, we may put together a web of guidelines which will strangle Members in the course of their normal work.</P>
    <P>I have examined the drafts produced by the Labour Party and I wonder whether we should go into the detail envisaged by it. I emphasise that the draft proposed is a useful basis for discussion. However, do we really want to lay down a guideline along the lines that Members must be as open as possible about the decisions and actions they take and that they should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly so demands? This is just one example of the rules proposed in the document attached to the Labour Party motion.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider carefully what will be included in the code of conduct. I am taken by the brief ten point document finally agreed by the Parliament of New South Wales which covers very broad principles rather than going into the detail envisaged in the Labour Party motion and discussed in other parliaments. However, that is for another day.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the motion reluctantly, it is unfortunate that such a motion has to be tabled because of past events. Those of us who serve the public should not need guidelines to tell us what is right. I am sure many of our predecessors would turn in their graves if they knew it was being suggested that their successors should be given directives on how to behave.</P>
      <P>The proposed code would lay down standards and introduce guidelines for us, the first of which would be that &ldquo;in common with all citizens, Members have an obligation to uphold the law&rdquo;. That would be dangerous in the sense that it would suggest that we were above the law. We must all uphold the law. If we have to be reminded of this in a code of ethics, we should not be here.</P>
      <P>The second guideline would be that &ldquo;Members should avoid waste, abuse and extravagance in the provision or use of public resources&rdquo;. There would be a danger that this would be open to interpretation. Many members of the public are of the view that we waste a lot of money. What we may consider as very valuable work, many members of public may regard as wasteful. My colleague mentioned some extreme examples in New South Wales where the ethics committee was self-perpetuating, cost a fortune and kept investigating minor breaches of the regulations which led to resignations. The Committee on Members' Interests should carefully consider whether such a guideline should be included in a code of ethics.</P>
      <P>To show how unified the Fine Gael Party is, my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, stole my thunder in dealing with some of the problems confronting the Committee on Members' Interests, on which we both serve.</P>

        <i>Una voce.</i> The Ethics in Public Office Act which blazed a trail in setting the standard for us needs to be reviewed. We took a lot of stick in one particular investigation in respect of which journalists, clearly, did not bother their heads looking at the regulations in place. Lest I forget to mention it, the committee is still in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second judgment we have to make is whether a breach occurred inadvertently, negligently, recklessly or intentionally. This amounts to a splitting of hairs. The only penalty available is that of suspension. While it is a major blow when a person is suspended by their colleagues, <Col N="1336" /> there is the valid criticism that suspending someone with pay for up to 30 days, depending on the seriousness of the breach, is not a severe punishment. While one needs to be fair in determining the length of suspension, there is a need to look again at the Ethics in Public in Office Act.</P>

      <P>The discussion of the establishment of a code of conduct should not start in this House, rather it should start in the home and be continued in school and our place of work, whether it be the Houses of the Oireachtas or elsewhere. In other words, we should be brought up with a proper code. Because of the breakdown of such a code in society, attention is being focused on us, as public representatives, because of the extent to which we are in the public eye. The discussion should, therefore, start at the earliest opportunity with our children or grandchildren.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte regrets the fact that the Government did not moot the idea of a code of conduct. I very much regret the fact that it is necessary to discuss the introduction of such a code. As Deputy Browne said, we are reacting to an impression that our profession lacks a code of conduct. We should defend our profession. It should not be necessary to introduce such a code, but should it prove necessary because of the actions of certain members of our profession &ndash; perhaps the same could be said of members of any other profession &ndash; I would support the motion tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to legislate for a code of conduct. One simply has to have one's own personal code. A Bill or motion would only cover the cracks to give the public the impression that there was a code of conduct to which we should live up. I have no doubt that 99.9% of Members have a code of conduct to which they live up and respect in their public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred, among others, to the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Public Service Management Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the legislation on compellability of witnesses before Oireachtas committees. He also said that 50% of requests under the Freedom of Information Act are for non-personal information and are made by journalists and other members of the public. Like other Deputies, I received a letter last week informing me that a journalist had sought information on the expenses of Deputies in the last year. The reproduction of such figures should be subject to a code of conduct. Let me take my own constituency as an example. It is represented by a Minister and two Ministers of State. The two remaining representatives &ndash; Deputy Higgins and myself &ndash; are in opposition, but only information on our legitimate expenses is published. Information on the expenses of Ministers and Ministers of State is not published. It is not right that selective infor<Col N="1337" /> mation is supplied about some representatives of a constituency under the Freedom of Information Act and not about others. There should be codes of conduct in places other than the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am grateful this matter was selected, I draw the House's attention to a similar question I posed for written reply today. I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Parliamentary Question No. 113 if she would consider introducing a scheme of grant-aid to facilitate the relocation of small industries which by virtue of their nature and expansion are now inappropriately located in residential urban settings; her views on whether such grant aid should be revenue neutral for the companies involved; and if she would make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Whoever was responsible for drafting the reply to that question is a disgrace. The reply did not address the issues I raised. It was a rambling ráiméis on the series of grant aids available to industry from State agencies and it did not address the issue of industries inappropriately located in growing urban centres which need some assistance for relocation.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and those responsible in the Department for drafting such replies should reflect on difficult lessons that have been learned about our failure to appropriately answer questions which have been tabled in the House.</P>
      <P>It is fortunate that in many settings around Ireland industries with humble origins are prospering, thriving and expanding but the regrettable reality in many instances, particularly in smaller urban locations outside the Pale, is that many of these expanding industries are inappropriately located and by virtue of increased residential development in these areas are entirely inappropriate to a residential setting.</P>
      <P>Two such companies in my constituency, both in the timber processing industry, are making valiant efforts to provide employment and have potential to create increased employment but because of understandable and legitimate concerns of residents adjacent to those companies there is a constant battle between the companies and residents. It cannot be forgotten that many companies generate in the heart of towns, valuable employment, not just in timber processing but in the hardware and milling industries, which would be more suited to the outskirts of towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and her Department should consider making grant-aid available to these companies so that they can relocate from where they are <Col N="1338" /> inappropriately located on a revenue neutral basis. Some of their tax liability could be written off or the value of the land they vacate, which would have development potential as it is in the heart of residential area, could be taken into account. Such companies should be facilitated in some innovative way through capital grants or a combination of capital grants and tax waivers or deferrals so that it is a win win scenario for the residents in the local community and the companies at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>If we are committed to framing such an initiative, we should also provide that the companies should not be allowed or facilitated when they relocate to move an inappropriate distance relative to those employed by the company. This will be a growing problem in many industries. It is stifling additional employment opportunities. Many of these companies are snarled up in the planning process and are engaged in hostilities with local residents, something which is understandable. An innovative approach by the Department could go a long way to resolving the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the Government is committed to supporting the development of the indigenous sector and that commitment was given new impetus by the establishment of Enterprise Ireland in 1998. At that time we set out clearly the basis on which the Government should intervene in industrial policy and we have put in place agencies, programmes and schemes to specifically address these issues.</P>
      <P>We recognise that while the creation of the pro-business climate which underlines Ireland's rapid economic progress has eliminated the need for certain Government interventions and while the new EU State aids policy has significantly reduced the amount of assistance which can be given to individual firms, especially in the form of capital and employment grants, it has not entirely eliminated the need for such interventions. Underlying all these policy interventions we recognise the need to constantly question whether the impact of any policy intervention is sufficient when judged relative to other areas of Government activity competing for funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with its mandate Enterprise Ireland concentrates on helping and supporting client companies to achieve sustainable competitive advantage leading to growth in profitable sales, exports and employment. Enterprise Ireland's approach to the development of the indigenous sector focuses on identifying the business needs and challenges facing its client companies in the competitive global market. It provides a streamlined and sensible response to those needs and challenges by offering support and advice on a basis which relates directly the key strategic business functions of firms i.e. strategy assessment and <Col N="1339" /> formulation; research; development and design; production and operations; marketing; and human resources and finance.</P>

      <P>The Government through its enterprise support agencies is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of indigenous industry in rural Ireland. The <Col N="1340" /> development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Tánaiste yesterday launched a new Enterprise Ireland initiative to support regional development by indigenous firms. The initiative is built on a four pillar approach which is focused on developing the competitiveness and export potential of existing businesses in the regions; enhancing the operating environment for business, particularly in facilitating companies to develop and access new technologies and, by working with other key players, to address the telecommunication and other infrastructure needs of companies throughout the country; supporting an increased level of new high potential start up companies throughout the country and facilitating the expansion of east coast companies to regional locations.</P>
      <P>In support of this new approach Enterprise Ireland has reorganised its network of regional offices which are now aligned to the new EU regions. The 100 strong regional team has expertise across all areas and sectors, including general business, development, finance, human resources, marketing and other specialist skills. In addition specific teams have been established to increase the number of high potential companies in regional locations.</P>
      <P>Under this initiative the agency has set ambitious targets for achievement over the next three years.</P>
      <P>These include assisting the establishment of 50 high potential start-up companies, 30 expansions of Dublin-based companies into the regions, assisting 150 companies from outside Dublin to become exporters for the first time and making 360 major investment commitments outside the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>This strategy has been specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of each of the individual regions, to maximise their strengths and overcome their weaknesses. It will make a real difference to enterprise development in the regions and will help to create a much more equitable and sustainable economic balance across the entire country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see that a Minister from Cork has chosen to answer this question. I look forward to hearing his reply. Last week, the Irish National Teachers Organisation published a list of seriously substandard primary schools in various areas around the country. The INTO undertook the study in the form of a questionnaire. Schools were asked to complete a check-list outlining substandard features in their buildings. The check-list featured the worst features a school could have, including sub-standard outdoor toilets, inadequate heating systems, <Col N="1341" /> unsanitary conditions, including evidence of vermin, and a lack of hand-washing and drying facilities.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey among the 40 worst schools were alarming. Half of them had evidence of rats or mice, while 75% had inadequate toilet facilities and a quarter of those were outdoor toilets. Some 65% had inadequate hand-washing or drying facilities for children and 45% had inadequate heating in classrooms. Some 50% had no drinking water for students, while 45% had rotting windows or doors.</P>
      <P>I recognise that while Deputy Martin was the Minister responsible, the Department of Education and Science invested quite significantly and made capital improvements to many primary schools, particularly in the Cork region. Clearly, however, a serious amount of capital investment still has to be made, particularly in primary schools. Of the 40 schools on this list my attention was drawn to the fact that five of them, or one eighth, are from Cork city and county. They are: Gaelscoil An Teaghlaigh Naofa in Ballyphehane; Maultrahane national school in Leap; Knocknamanagh national school, Minane Bridge, County Cork, to which I will refer again in a moment; Curraneasig national school in Kilbrittain; and Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers in Cork city.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister, Deputy Martin, ask the Minister for Education and Science to appoint someone from his Department to investigate the conditions in these Cork schools and in the remaining 35 schools that have been pinpointed in this report? In that way we can put the resources in place to ensure that a common standard applies to all primary schools.</P>
      <P>I have a specific concern relating to Minane Bridge national school. I am reliably informed that this school is not on the list due to hygiene issues but because of serious overcrowding involving lack of space in classrooms and in the school yard. There are 142 students there at present, with four teachers in four small classrooms. Two of those classrooms are made up of one room which is divided by a temporary partition.</P>
      <P>In 1998 this school applied for two extra classrooms. It also applied for assembly rooms comprising a staff room, a small room for a remedial teacher and a covered recreational area to facilitate children when it is raining. Yet, nothing concrete has occurred in the past two years. When the extension was applied for, the school had only 120 pupils but, as I have pointed out, it now has 142. Next year, the enrolment will be between 150 and 160. As the Minister knows, this means an extra teacher will be involved due to the pupil-teacher ratio guidelines. This, in turn, will necessitate the provision of an extra classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> Minane Bridge is an example of an old rural school that has had to expand due to an increase in population from an expanding town nearby. In the immediate term the school requires one, if not two prefabricated buildings to relieve overcrowding. In the medium to long-term, however, serious capital investment will be required to extend the school so that children in the area can be provided with a proper standard of education. Primary education is the key to moulding our young people. I have heard the Minister, Deputy Martin, speak many times about the importance of primary education, and I agree with him.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing his response and witnessing swift action, particularly for Minane Bridge national school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue this evening and for giving me an opportunity to outline, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the current position regarding Minane Bridge national school, County Cork.</P>
      <P>From my experience, I would take issue with the INTO's list. It is somewhat disingenuous in that it fails to mention that sanction for extension projects, that are either at design stage or close to it and indeed to tendering, has been approved for the vast majority of schools on the list. For example, I sanctioned an extension project for one school the Deputy mentioned, Gaelscoil An Teaghlaigh Naofa, over 18 months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is close to the tendering process. It is disgraceful for the INTO to have put that school on a list that refers to a lack of hygiene and rodent infestation because the school does not have those problems, neither does Minane Bridge national school. This concerns relativity and how we prioritise matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but the INTO allegation about rats has been a feature of such press releases for about ten or 15 years. One could acknowledge that there has been a dramatic increase in investment, particularly since 1997. Now and again, I used to joke with the INTO that I had not seen the rat for quite some time, but it re-emerged last week. As regards some of these schools there was an element of not being up front. The Deputy may be aware of what happened in the case of Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers. The Department was anxious to build a school. We sanctioned it and funded it but there was a third party planning objection. There are disgraceful conditions in that gaelscoil, which is in a GAA complex, and the facilities are very difficult. A <Col N="1343" /> site was secured and the community was behind it. An application for planning permission was made and it went to An Bord Pleanála but it was overruled, unfortunately in my opinion because it meant the children were deprived of better conditions. This was not due to lack of funding or of effort or commitment by the Department, yet the impression given, if one sees it on the INTO list, is that it was. It most certainly was not, however. These points need to be made.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I acknowledge that there are schools on the list whose conditions are not acceptable and that we should improve. As the Deputy pointed out, Minane Bridge national school has a staffing level of a principal, four mainstream class teachers, one shared learning support teacher and one shared resource teacher. An application has been received from the management authority of the school seeking grant assistance towards an extension consisting of an additional classroom, a general purpose room, a store room, office staff room and general refurbishment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Education and Science has produced a new template for primary schools, and was working on it for quite some time. Over a year ago it produced what, ideally, every primary school should have. That involves a general purpose room, even for small schools, and remedial rooms. More applications are coming in as a result. The Department is obviously assessing enrolment projections, but I assure the Deputy that we will do whatever we can to try to progress this particular application as speedily as we can. Both the Deputy and the school authorities will be kept informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by the Government over the past three years in eliminating substandard schools from our education system. Since taking office the Government has invested massively in capital projects for the primary sector. For 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects. This has been increased to £93 million for the current school year and compares with only £19.5 million in 1993 and £34 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan an unprecedented £413 million has been set aside for school infrastructure. In addition to these measures, the level of grant aid under the capital devolved grant scheme for the primary sector was recently increased. Given the capital devolved grants that have been given out, there is no excuse for any school not having proper water supplies, no matter what kind of building it is. That is a matter for the boards of management and I would not accept that any school, nowadays, should not have such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year £14 million was allocated on that scheme alone. A similar amount will be allocated <Col N="1344" /> for this current school year. That is a matter for the boards of management of the schools and I would not accept that any school nowadays should not have that.</P>
    <P>Some £14 million was allocated to that scheme alone in 2000 and a similar amount will be allocated for the current school year. That empowers boards of management to address health and safety issues at local level.</P>
    <P>From the outset, this Government has made education a top priority. Never in our history has so much money been invested in education as this Government has invested over the past three years. We acknowledge that much remains to be done and we remain committed to education as a top priority and we will continue to build on the progress we have made to date. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. We will certainly do what we can to try to accelerate the project.</P>

      <P>Since my election to this House in 1997, I have, on numerous occasions, raised issues relative to the delivery of services and the infrastructure of the health services in Carlow-Kilkenny. The reason for raising this matter and for seeking a reply from the Minister is out of sheer frustration in dealing with the South Eastern Health Board. Clearly this is a matter which the public representatives and the medical board of the hospital have discussed. Clearly, it does not undermine the staff in the hospital who do an excellent job and who work way beyond the call of duty in delivering the services.</P>
      <P>On two occasions since Christmas I have raised the issue publicly &ndash; on local radio and through the local press. It is a deep public concern. Last night, arising from that report, all the Oireachtas representatives attended a meeting in St. Luke's Hospital with the board. They were presented with the following analysis of the main medical section of the hospital dealing with January only. Some 81 patients were admitted directly on to the corridor during that period. Of the 81 patients the average length of time spent on the corridor was 18 hours. The minimum length of time spent on the corridor was one hour but the maximum was 72 hours. Some ten patients were admitted on to the corridor of that ward in one day. Patients were accommodated on the corridor every day during that period &ndash; in other words, there was 100% occupancy of the corridor. There were 11 incidents on the corridor during that period ranging from a mild heart attack to caring for those who arrived in a distressed state. It has now become an unacceptable feature in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983, this situation was widely reported in the local papers. Therefore, it does not just occur in the month of January and because extra patients came in during the winter months. It has now become a feature of the hospital. The public <Col N="1345" /> and staff of the hospital object to it. Last night, as public representatives, we insisted that we would raise the matter in the House and request that the Minister visit the hospital and discuss the matter directly with the medical board, the people and the consultants we met last night. The phrase used right through the meeting was that &ldquo;the hospital was out of control&rdquo;. Staff cannot afford to be sick as there is no back up staff. The nurses are at breaking point and they have reported the situation to the INO.</P>
    <P>I have given an outline of what happened on the medical ward. I raised the issue of the gynaecological ward prior to Christmas on which there were three miscarriages, one in the antenatal ward and two in the corridor. After I raised it here, because it had happened twice, I was told it was an isolated incident and that I would receive a report in due course. I have still not received that report. The health board is almost non-functional in that area.</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly is being totally overlooked. There is no room for them or selection of beds for them in the hospital. There is an immediate demand for the community hospital to be constructed in St. Luke's. There is a need for more acute beds and the immediate development of the casualty ward with the appropriate staffing levels because, quite frankly, the consultants, doctors, nurses and general staff have said clearly that they cannot take any more. They are appealing for immediate intervention by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is hard for the public to take this when a very large ward in a neighbouring hospital, Kilcreene, on which the Government has spent a great deal of money refurbishing and re-roofing, is closed. I understand it is used as a storage area. It is very hard to reconcile that with what is happening in the county hospital, St. Luke's, on a regular basis. When I say &ldquo;county hospital&rdquo;, I acknowledge that it services part of the region.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the health board to immediately plan for an outreach centre in County Carlow. It is a county which has been very poorly serviced by way of investment in services and infrastructure. I hope a plan for a county hospital in Carlow is drawn up. It is a growing urban centre which is growing way beyond its current stated population. I ask the Minister to immediately intervene beyond the spend of £35 million which is already committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for allowing me the opportunity to outline the current position in relation to the health services in the Carlow-Kilkenny area. The provision of services in the Carlow-Kilkenny area is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. It is statutorily obligated to provide such services. The South Eastern Health Board document, Shaping the Future of the Kilkenny Hospital System, proposes wide ranging <Col N="1346" /> improvements to community based and hospital based services. Major developments were envisaged in acute care services for the elderly, mental health services, services for the disabled, community health and child care services. This document provides a blueprint for the development of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, as a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital capable of meeting the challenges of the times in a competent and humane manner. The target date set for rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city into an interactive hospital complex is 2002.</P>
      <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site, including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access to the public with a cost effective service. Considerable progress is being made in the development of these services.</P>
      <P>The new accident and emergency room in the radiology department is now fully operational. All in-patient requests are being cleared on the same day. This is an important development in terms of the timely diagnosis and discharge of patients which helps maximise the utilisation of beds. The staffing of the laboratory services was strengthened in 2000 and the Department has also approved the permanent filling of a consultant physician-endocrinologist post. This will reduce the pressure on medical in-patient beds as more diabetic patients are seen earlier and treated on an out-patient basis.</P>
      <P>The regional palliative care service was further developed in 2000. A four bed medical assessment unit was opened in November 2000 and this unit allows medical patients to be assessed before being admitted to the medical wards. Further developments in 2001 include completion of the CT scanner building, the completion of a 45 bed psychiatric unit, a diabetic day care centre and a special baby care unit. These development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local general hospitals which serve a defined catchment area and which provide general medical and surgical facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues last year and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. A more detailed assessment of need is now being undertaken to inform decisions on a longer term investment strategy for the acute <Col N="1347" /> and non-acute sectors and I expect this phase of the review to be completed in the spring of this year.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined are a further demonstration of my commitment and that of this Government to the continued provision of optimum health services to the people in the Carlow-Kilkenny area and the South Eastern Health Board region generally. I will take on board the commitments the Deputy made in relation to the meeting he attended last evening and will convey those to the board for a prompt reply. I have already been to the Kilkenny hospital and met the management board and the chief executive officer there early last year. Major construction work is under way on the site and there are major development plans. Obviously, we all want to see the present situation improved and that is why there is so much capital investment and revenue investment in the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to waive privilege in respect of the documents being sought by the Irish Haemophilia Society as is required under the terms of reference of the tribunal which were agreed unanimously by the House. Term of reference No. 8 allows the tribunal to investigate the response of the State and State agencies to those who have hepatitis and HIV infections. That response was intended by the IHS during the course of negotiations at all times to include the investigation of the HIV compensation settlement in 1991.</P>
      <P>To facilitate such an investigation, procedural term five is applicable. This term was inserted at the behest of the IHS. It states: &ldquo;All persons employed in the Department of State and State agencies concerned shall give their full co-operation to the tribunal and those Departments of State and agencies shall themselves fully co-operate with the tribunal by providing it with all the documents and information requested of them that are in their possession or power.&rdquo;  The three important words in this clause are &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, &ldquo;providing&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rdquo;. The case submitted by the IHS to Judge Lindsay was not that a resolution of the Oireachtas amended the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts in terms of an entitlement to waive legal professional privilege. The case submitted was to the effect that the Minister for Health and Children, by virtue of signing the document, indicated that &ldquo;all the documents and information requested of them that are in their possession or power&rdquo; shall &ldquo;be provided to the tribunal&rdquo;. In essence, the fact that the Minister had signed a resolution in such mandatory terms precluded him from reneging upon that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, stated at the time that &ldquo;section (v) requires all persons employed by bodies under the aegis of the State who are relevant to the inquiry to co-operate fully with the tribunal, including providing it with all the documents and information it requests, if it is in their power to do so&rdquo;. There was no mention that legal technicalities such as legal professional privilege would be used to prevent the tribunal obtaining all documentation relevant to its investigation when the matter was brought before this House. In essence, the Minister has a right to waive privilege over documentation obtained in the privilege section of his affidavit of discovery.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there is no necessity even to use affidavits of discovery; it is sufficient to provide documentation for the purposes of the tribunal's investigation. The examination of such documentation should take place with a view to establishing if the State was aware of its liabilities when it entered into the HIV settlement with people with haemophilia in 1991. This is of most crucial importance with regard to the late HIV factor IX infections in 1985-86, which is now known to have been caused by BTSB factor IX concentrate.</P>
    <P>It is of fundamental importance to ascertain whether citizens were misled by State or State agencies when those citizens were seriously ill, dying and disadvantaged, thereby losing their entitlement to fair and equitable compensation. Five of the seven people who became infected from BTSB factor IX concentrate are now deceased. One of the persons who was so infected, infected his partner. Some of these people died horrific deaths in circumstances where the compensation afforded by the State was inadequate to provide for their family needs.</P>
    <P>There are other issues pertinent to the remaining people with haemophilia who entered into this settlement that are likely to be contained in the documentation over which the State continues to claim privilege. If the Minister wishes to maintain transparency, openness and honesty on this issue, he should do the decent thing, even though it is ten years late, and allow a comprehensive investigation to be undertaken. If the State has infected its citizens and refuses to admit responsibility, the State, on behalf of its people, has taken advantage of its most vulnerable citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to outline the various strands of this matter which appear to have become intertwined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the claiming of legal privilege over documents by State parties, including my Department, is interfering with the Lindsay tribunal's ability to investigate fully the circumstances of the contamination of blood products manufactured here or imported for use by persons with haemophilia. In relation to this <Col N="1349" /> issue, the House should note that all documents relevant to the Lindsay tribunal's inquiries into the circumstances of the contamination with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia were made available to the tribunal by my Department on foot of a discovery order made by the tribunal. My Department has co-operated fully with the tribunal at all times, a fact acknowledged by Judge Alison Lindsay in the course of her ruling on the matter of discovery on 1 February last.</P>
    <P>The facts in relation to the tribunal's ruling on claims for privilege are as follows. On 30 January 2001, senior counsel for the Irish Haemophilia Society made an application to the Lindsay tribunal of inquiry in relation to the claims of privilege made by parties represented before the tribunal. The application was directed not against the parties themselves but at the tribunal's acceptance of the claims without challenge.</P>
    <P>The primary basis upon which the society challenged the tribunal on this matter was the inclusion in the tribunal's terms of reference of the following paragraph: &ldquo;All persons employed in the Departments of State and State agencies concerned shall give their full co-operation to the tribunal and those Departments of State and agencies shall themselves fully co-operate with the tribunal by providing it with all the documents and information requested of them that are in their possession or power.&rdquo;  The society contended that this paragraph effectively precluded the parties identified therein from raising claims to privilege over any documents in their power or possession.</P>
    <P>Having listened to legal argument from all relevant parties, Judge Lindsay ruled on the society's application on 1 February. She ruled that the right to claim legal privilege is fundamental to our common law system, to practice and procedure in the courts and to the proper running of tribunals. The right is enshrined in statute and is one that cannot, in her view, be taken away.</P>
    <P>Judge Lindsay said, from a normal reading of the said paragraph, it was to be interpreted as resolving that all persons employed by the State or State agencies would co-operate with the tribunal and she stated that, at this stage, all those persons who have been requested to co-operate have done so. She ruled that the argument made by the society, to interpret the said paragraph as impliedly waiving the right to privilege of Departments of State and State agencies, was not viable, legal or proper. The resolution of the Dáil and Seanad, by which the tribunal was established and which sets out the tribunal's terms of reference, could not change the law which confers the right to claim privilege. Furthermore, the right to claim legal privilege is vested in individual persons or bodies and the State does not have the power to waive that right.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in her ruling did Judge Lindsay say or imply that the tribunal's efforts to establish the <Col N="1350" /> full truth as to the circumstances of the contamination of blood supplies given to those with haemophilia had been hindered in any way.</P>
    <P>During the tribunal's hearing of the application, it was suggested by senior counsel for the society that it had been its understanding during the consultations on the tribunal's terms of reference that the State parties would not be claiming privilege over any documents in relation to the tribunal's inquiries. I personally was not involved in any of those consultations but I understand the matter of privilege was not discussed. That is an issue that can be resolved later. I was not there at the time. The paragraph in the terms of reference which was cited by the society as containing an implied waiver of privilege had been included in the terms of reference for the Finlay tribunal of inquiry and was included in the Lindsay inquiry's terms of reference as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>The rules of privilege applied in the case of the Finlay tribunal into the Blood Transfusion Service Board and I do not think there is any question but that the Finlay tribunal was able to ascertain the full facts in relation to its investigations.</P>
    <P>The documents over which my Department has claimed privilege have been categorised and enumerated in the second part of the first schedule of the Department's affidavit of discovery in full compliance with the directions in relation to claiming privilege, a fact which was also acknowledged by Judge Lindsay in her ruling. The documents comprise documents brought into existence for the purpose of seeking legal advice or for the purpose of litigation, both well established bases for claiming privilege.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society has suggested that the documents over which my Department has claimed privilege could throw new light on what the State knew about the contamination of blood products in 1991, when the compensation package between the State and HIV infected haemophiliacs was agreed. The files relating to the 1991 settlement, excluding those documents over which a claim for privilege has been made, have already been disclosed to the Lindsay tribunal. I am currently discussing the question of privilege with my legal advisers. Considerable attention has been given in recent days to the 1991 settlement of £8 million agreed between legal advisers acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society and legal advisers acting for the State. The Government has already agreed that HIV-infected haemophiliacs should receive adequate and equitable compensation and detailed discussions are ongoing between legal advisers acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society and legal advisers for the State. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to these discussions, I intend to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act to allow HIV-infected haemophiliacs to receive compensation on the same basis as those infected with hepatitis C through the administration of blood products, <Col N="1351" /> including women who received infected anti-D. I will keep the Deputy and the House informed of developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 43 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently four vacancies in the Competition Authority. One is for a legal adviser and three are at administrative level. A competition will be held for the legal adviser position and the administrative staff will be assigned to the authority in the normal way by internal transfer within the staffing supplement of my Department, as soon as possible. There have been difficulties in recruiting administrative staff generally for the Civil Service and my Department and other Departments are experiencing some delays in filling such positions.</P>
      <P>Last year between May and October, a review by the consultants, Deloitte and Touche, of the structure, operations, resource requirements, business processes and IT systems in the Competition Authority took place with a view to providing clear recommendations on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>The review was also to provide an indication of necessary staffing levels and the final report contained a central recommendation that the staffing complement of the authority be increased to 44. Prior to the review, the authorised complement was 24 and following an interim report by the consultants, I increased the complement by two senior economists and three legal advisers to 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15 additional posts are recommended over a range of grades and within these it is recom<Col N="1354" /> mended that three gardaí should be appointed to the Competition Authority to assist in its investigatory functions.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering the overall body of recommendations made in the report and I will finalise my position in due course.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance in its Stability and Growth Pact, published on budget day, predicted a further tightening of the labour market in 2001. The Department forecast employment growth of 3.5%, or an additional 60,000 persons at work, average annual growth of 2.25% in the labour force over the next three years and a further fall in the unemployment rate to 3.2%.</P>
      <P>The Government has in place a comprehensive strategy to meet the labour market challenges faced by a growing economy. Key elements in the overall policy mix include fiscal measures aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of taking up a job and remaining in work; active labour market programmes to assist the unemployed and disadvantaged in their transition to employment; placement of job seekers through the preventive strategy under the employment action plan; measures aimed at upgrading the skills of those both at work and unemployed; and enhanced child care facilities. The range and scale of interventions will continue to fully mobilise labour supply from domestic sources and will especially encourage increased participation of females in the labour market.</P>
      <P>This approach is being augmented with a process aimed at attracting immigrants to our growing economy. Net outward migration of the early 1990s has been replaced with net inflows, of the order of 20,000 per annum over the last three years, of whom approximately 80% are from EU member states or returned Irish immigrants. Over 18,000 work permits were issued last year to non-EEA nationals. The implementation, in April 2000, of the new working visa/authorisation system resulted in the granting of 1,387 authorisations up to the end of December 2000. In addition, the Jobs Ireland campaign, operated by FÁS, is seeking to encourage people overseas to take up employment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the Government currently has a comprehensive strategy in place to maximise labour supply consistent with the demands of a growing economy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the NESF report on alleviating labour shortages which is both timely and important. A clear focus of the report is on the implementation of policies aimed at augmenting labour supply as a fundamental element in addressing labour shortages. It has made recommendations in several key policy areas in order to ensure effective opportunities for participation in the labour force. Policy areas of particular focus in the report were those of welfare to work, taxation, bridging efforts to enhance access of women and other groups to the labour market and migration. As such there is a very good conceptual framework for developing the key policy orientations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government already has in place a wide range of strategies to meet the labour market challenges of a growing economy. There are many aspects to the policy mix being pursued. Reducing the tax burden on labour and improving the reward from work is a principal feature of the strategy in place. In addition, measures aimed at both increasing the labour supply and upgrading the skills of the workforce, and assisting those at a far remove from the labour market, are key aspects of the current policy mix, and are outlined in detail in the Employment Action Plan 2000. In the current labour market an unprecedented opportunity exists to improve the employment prospects of a wide cross-section of persons including those who are long-term unemployed or others facing significant labour market disadvantage. Overall, therefore, current Government <Col N="1357" /> policy is in keeping with the policy thrust outlined in the NESF report.</P>
    <P>The Government has arranged for the report to be examined by a number of Departments with responsibility for implementation of the policies which have been the subject of consideration by the NESF. In addition, it has referred the report to the strategy group on employment and unemployment, which is charged with overall policy examination of labour market issues.</P>

      <P>With regard to the plans to intensify the EMU business awareness campaign, a comprehensive programme of activities is in place for this final year of the changeover which will include a major advertising campaign using television, radio, press and Internet advertising, commencing on a phased basis from the week beginning 5 February, new information material will be prepared and distributed to SMEs covering key preparation issues including cash changeover, accounting, software and other aspects as well as specific guidelines for retailers, production of a training pack for all retailers for the purpose of staff training; presentations on the relevant EMU planning issues for business at meetings, conferences and/or seminars of professional, trade and business organisations, particularly those that represent companies in the SME sector, exhibition stands at appropriate conferences, trade and business exhibitions that facilitate dissemination of campaign information, particularly to companies in the SME sector and articles/features in relevant publications, newsletters and journals of trade, business and professional organisations particularly those focused on companies in the SME sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the campaign will continue with its joint information initiative with <i>Running Your Business</i>, the magazine of the Small Firms Association which is circulated to a dedicated list of 30,000 small firms; a LoCall help line will continue to assist businesses with their queries regarding changeover issues; and a national conference on the euro will be held in Loughrea, County Galway, on 19 February, which will highlight the changeover experiences of the SME <Col N="1358" /> firms involved in the Loughrea euro town project as they switched to euro based trading. The Loughrea project, run under the auspices of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, has identified many practical issues for SMEs in preparing for the euro.</P>
    <P>The primary concern for the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign is to ensure that each business is made sufficiently aware of the need to have made the changeover by 31 December 2001 and that each company is encouraged to determine now the likely scale of the changeover for their particular business and prepare its plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is clear that all Irish firms, irrespective of their size, must make the necessary preparations now to ensure that they will be able to operate in euro by year end.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ISME survey referred to by the Deputy and, in considering the extent to which SME firms have prepared for the changeover, it is important to realise that for a considerable number of SMEs, particularly those focused predominately on the domestic market, there is little incentive to switch over to euro-based trading during the transitional period. In fact, it may not be in their commercial best interest to change over any earlier than 1 January 2002. To force such companies to implement systems that can accommodate both Irish pound and euro transactions during this transitional period may be unwarranted, unnecessary and needlessly expensive.</P>
    <P>What is required is for SME firms to make a smooth transition from operating in one currency, the Irish pound, to another currency, the euro, by 1 January 2002. Obviously, to make such a transition efficiently and effectively requires planning and preparation well in advance of that date. Ultimately, however, the responsibility in effecting the changeover rests with each individual firm and the Government can only assist in providing the necessary information that will help them do this, a view that is shared by ISME and highlighted in the release accompanying their survey results.</P>

      <P>E-business requires a clear and consistent regulatory framework that serves the interests of business, individuals, and intellectual property holders and prevents fraud. In addition, because of the transnational nature of the new technologies, the regulatory framework requires extensive co-operation at EU and international level, including through the OECD, the WTO and the UN.</P>
      <P>Our approach is to regulate or to support regulation only where necessary and to keep the regulatory framework as straightforward as possible to avoid creating an overly complex or burdensome system that will hamper the development of the knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>At national level, substantial progress has already been achieved through the enactment of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000, which was brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, in collaboration with our Department, and the enactment of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>At EU level, political agreement was reached in November last on the text of the draft Brussels regulation, which deals with the principles of jurisdiction in the case of cross-border disputes between private parties and aims to speed up further the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Our Department, along with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, played a significant role in bringing the main issues affecting e-commerce, from both the perspective of the trader and the consumer, to the attention of other member states.</P>
      <P>A substantial body of information society related legislation is in preparation in a range of Departments, including our own, covering issues such as electronic commerce, the protection of consumers in respect of distant contracts, data protection, telecommunications issues and digital television. Our Department is working closely with the other Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> Work is ongoing at EU and international levels on further significant initiatives such as the draft directive on distant selling of financial services to consumers, the Rome convention on applicable law, the draft Hague Convention on Jurisdiction on Foreign Judgements and the draft Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Our Department will work with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the Rome, Hague and cybercrime instruments take account of requirements of business in the information society while also taking account of the interests of individuals.</P>
    <P>The pace of change generated by the knowledge economy requires us to look at more flexible methods of regulation, including codes of practice. Our Department is currently involved in the preparation of codes of practice in relation to specific aspects of the knowledge economy, including unsolicited commercial communications and the harmful use of the Internet.</P>

      <P>Many of the recently announced major job losses in overseas owned plants in Ireland are arising from restructuring, with activities at the lower end of the value added chain being phased out as they become uneconomic.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's strategy is to encourage Irish plants of global companies to move up the value added chain into higher skilled and better paid jobs, thus enhancing their international competitiveness and employment. In this context also, a major part of IDA efforts is focused on embedding existing overseas owned companies more firmly in the economy with a view to having strategically independent operations in Ireland within their corporate structures worldwide.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland and other State agencies are intensifying their efforts to attract replacement projects to areas affected by major job losses and to assist the development and expansion of existing industry in those areas. Every effort is being made to assist the workers affected to find alternative employment and to provide retraining, where appropriate, to enhance employment prospects.</P>

      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are currently ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Co. Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. The examinations of Kentford Securities Limited and Celtic Helicopters Limited are at an advanced stage and I expect to receive final reports on these companies in the coming months. The examinations of Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and College Trustees Limited are continuing.</P>
      <P>In its judgment of 28 July 2000, the High Court quashed the section 19 appointments to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. Considerable issues of law have arisen from that decision, and an appeal has been lodged to the Supreme Court and will be heard on 2 July 2001.</P>
      <P>A further six investigations have been completed to date, namely, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, under section 59 of the Insurance Acts, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, Garuda Limited, t/a Streamline Enterprises, Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Faxhill Homes Limited, the latter four under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited, t/a Streamline Enterprises, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.</P>
      <P>Consultations with my legal advisers are ongoing regarding the initiation of summary prosecutions for breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty nine summonses have been issued against Faxhill Homes Limited and its directors in respect of breaches of the Companies Acts. The case is currently being heard in Naas District Court. The defendants have pleaded guilty to <Col N="1362" /> three offences under section 91 of the Companies Act, 1963. The case will resume on 5 March 2001.</P>
    <P>As regards the section 8 High Court inquiry into Ansbacher Cayman Limited, the current inspectors are Mr. Paul Rowan, FCA, Ms Noreen Mackey, BL, Mr. Justice Seán O'Leary and Mr. Michael Cush, SC. The inspectors are operating to the mandate of the High Court and will make reports to the court in due course. I expect that it will be at least six months before this inquiry can be completed.</P>

    <P>I am alert to recent reports, including this one, concerning the treatment of some immigrant workers by a number of unscrupulous Irish employers and employment agencies. In this connection my Department is taking a number of specific initiatives as follows: possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland; a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act of 1971 is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to mod<Col N="1363" /> ern practices in the employment agency business; the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits are being examined so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned; the labour inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed; the labour inspectorate is currently engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel-catering sector staff; relevant employers and employment agencies are being followed in this process with a view to prosecutions and it is intended that as soon as is practicable applications for work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers.

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities, injuries and inspections in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is therefore obtainable directly from the authority. I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 23 construction related fatalities in 2000. The number of accidents resulting in more than three days absence from work reported to date to the Health and Safety Authority for 2000 was 952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and awareness raising coupled with a partnership approach. There is a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed and this legislation is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources, both financial and staffing, which I have secured for the authority, <Col N="1364" /> are being put to good effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities. However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector, a strong partnership approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety must be adopted. This partnership approach was further developed and strengthened in 2000 in the context of the construction safety partnership &ndash; CSP &ndash; which includes representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU.</P>
    <P>The report of the CSP sets out a detailed three year partnership plan to improve occupational safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry, and the parties to the plan have made a number of wide ranging commitments which they have undertaken to implement over that period of time. The recommendations of the partnership plan cover measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training, introduction of safety management systems and increased inspection activity by the Health and Safety Authority. Work will continue throughout this year on implementing the recommendations of the plan and it is proposed to publish a report recording progress over the first year by the end of the first quarter of 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers, whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority Road Accident Facts report for 1999 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies, in the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite. It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a <Col N="1365" /> scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver, on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report it is hoped to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process. It is also intended to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, the most effective way of ensuring that the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition, from authorised insurers in all EU member states, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the market.</P>

      <P>The employment rights information unit of my Department operates an information service to answer enquiries about employment rights legislation and to inform people of the rights and obligations of all employees and employers under that legislation. The number of telephone inquiries received during 2000 amounted to 117,733, representing a 38% increase on the 85,469 calls received in 1999. This substantial increase reflects a growing public awareness, demand for and usage of the services provided.

The <Col N="1367" /> written statement must contain particulars of terms and conditions, as specified in the Act. These include the rate or method of calculation of the employee's remuneration, hours of work, including overtime, and paid leave entitlements.

    <P>As regards enforcement under this Act, an employee may present a complaint to a rights commissioner if it appears that his/her employer has failed to provide a full and accurate written statement of the terms of employment.</P>
    <P>I am alert to the various concerns which have been expressed with regard to the treatment of some immigrant workers by a number of Irish employers and employment agencies and in this connection my Department is taking a number of specific initiatives as follows: possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland, a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business, the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits are being amended to ensure that the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned are protected, the labour inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed, the labour inspectorate is currently engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel/catering sector staff and relevant employers and employment agencies are being followed in this process with a view to prosecutions and future applications for work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages.</P>

      <P>My Department charges an administrative fee to Irish employers for the examination and issue of work permits in respect of non-EEA nationals where such approval is warranted. This is the only fee which is payable in respect of the issue of a work permit in this State.</P>
      <P>In recent times complaints have been made to me that some non-nationals and recruitment agencies have been claiming that they can guarantee a work permit for admission to this country in return for large sums of money. I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that no one can guarantee work permits for non-nationals. Such permits are only be issued by my Department and are granted only where the relevant conditions have been met. I have instructed my Department to examine very carefully any future applications for work permits involving individuals or agencies about whom complaints have been received.</P>

However, I must point out to the Deputy that there is no legal obligation on retailers to pass on VAT reductions to consumers. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Director of Consumer Affairs to enforce any such reductions. However, my colleague the Minister for Finance indicated in his budget speech that he would monitor the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 2000 I brought a memorandum to Government seeking Government's approval for the drafting of a general scheme of a competition and mergers Bill. This arose out of the recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. The Government authorised the drafting of a consolidated Competition and Mergers Bill at their meeting on 24 October 2000. I had asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. The recommendations referred to the review group concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares, and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
      <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC, made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law and the administration of mergers law. Two of the 40 recommendations relate to newspapers and media and arise from the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which reported in June 1996. The review group has recommended legislative changes so as to require the Minister, when considering a merger in the media sector, to consider certain criteria identified by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other recommendation relates to the issue of the acquisition of undertakings by means other than the acquisition of shares. The Competition and Mergers Review Group have recommended that the control test in the EU merger regulation be incorporated into Irish merger law. I have accepted the recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on the news<Col N="1371" /> paper issue and work on the drafting of a consolidated competition and mergers Bill including these and other legislative changes is proceeding in my Department. It is my intention that the Bill will be published later this year.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force on 1 April 2000 and delivered on the Government's commitment in its programme for Government to introduce a national minimum hourly wage. During the passage of the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, through the House, the Minister gave a commitment to establish a tripartite monitoring group. The group was established in June last year and comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC and my Department. The remit of the group is to monitor and assess the implementation of the Act and report its findings and any recommendations to the Minister. The group has met twice since June 2000 and a further meeting is planned for early next month.</P>
      <P>The ESRI has been commissioned to carry out a follow-up survey to the firm survey it carried out in late 1998/early 1999. The results of the 1998-99 firm survey formed part of the ESRI study, published in June 1999, of the likely impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage. The results of the follow-up survey are expected during May and will assist the monitoring group in its work.</P>
      <P>The legislation is enforced by all 17 inspectors attached to the labour inspectorate of my Department. Since the commencement of the Act a total of 3,396 compliance inspections have been carried out by the inspectorate. Infringements have tended to be of a rather minor nature and to be more the result of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the provisions of the Act than of deliberate intention to defraud. They have normally been rectified through the intervention of the visiting inspectors and, with one exception which is under consideration, the need for legal prosecution has not arisen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much aware of the reports in regard to the treatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here which indicate a total disregard for the employment rights of the people concerned by a number of unscrupulous employers and employment agencies. Any abuses of such statutory employment rights and protections that immigrant workers may have been subjected to are to be unreservedly condemned. These abuses typically involve the reneging on the pay terms and other working conditions offered to the immigrant worker before departure from his or her home country. When placed in employment here in Ireland they may then be subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, for example, excessive accommo<Col N="1375" /> dation fees, non-payment of overtime or Sunday or holiday/public holiday pay, etc.</P>
    <P>The labour inspectorate has engaged in a number of investigations over the last few months on foot of the reports already mentioned and further investigative action is contemplated very soon. Meanwhile, material already gathered is being assessed carefully with a view to preparing a submission to the Chief State Solicitor for the commencement of legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Apart from possible breaches of Irish employment rights legislation there are issues of contract law at play in these deliberations, together with problems as to jurisdiction. In this regard there are some indications that recruitment fees are being sought at the point of origin. The Employment Agency Act, 1971, permits employment agencies to charge placement fees to the employers for whom they source foreign workers but it precludes them from charging such fees to the individual workers concerned. Given these latter factors, my Department is taking a number of specific initiatives as follows: possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland, a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business, the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits are being examined so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned, the labour inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed, the labour inspectorate is currently engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel/catering sector staff, relevant employers and employment agencies are being followed in this process with a view to prosecutions, and it is intended that as soon as is practicable applications for work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages.</P>

      <P>In 1999, I considered it was in the public interest to examine our current approach to public safety. Consequently, I established the Interdepartmental-Agency Review Group on Public Safety to examine the State's approach to public safety, the adequacy of the existing approach, to identify any deficiencies and to develop a co-ordinated, cohesive and comprehensive approach. In compiling its report the group consulted with all Departments-Agencies and also received submissions (56) from other interested bodies. These primarily dealt with road safety, licensing of events, the regulation of the electrical industry and building controls. The group also carried out research as to how public safety is addressed in other countries.</P>
      <P>I published the report of the review group on 29 December, 2000 and I will be discussing the implications of the group's proposals with my Government colleagues.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for the appointment of an Ombudsman for the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Government Departments. In November, 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide-memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government in relation to any necessary action. One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard. The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 2000 I decided to undertake a review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>The background to the review is that the Employment Agency Act has been in place for almost thirty years now. The employment market in Ireland has been transformed in recent years, driven by increased employment opportunities. Employment agencies have responded by developing their services to meet the needs of employers and potential employees. Such services are increasingly provided by the Internet and across borders by the same means. Increasingly, the services of employment agencies are being developed by e-business, while the 1971 Act operated on the notion of services being provided from an establishment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the recent publicity relating to the alleged charging of fees by employment agencies to non-EU nationals seeking employment in Ireland has emphasised the need to review the legislation to see if it still adequately meets current labour market requirements.</P>
      <P>I have written to the social partners and other interested parties requesting their views regarding the review. On receipt of these views I will consult with the parties concerned with a view to determining the best way forward. Following this, it may be necessary to consult with the Attorney General on any legal implications involved. I would expect to advance the review considerably by autumn of this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to recent media reports regarding the abuse of non-nationals being placed in employment here, the position is that section 7 of the Employment Agency Act, 1971 provides that an employment agency shall not charge any fees or expenses in respect of services rendered in the course of the business, in excess of a scale approved by the Minister. The agency is also required to prepare and submit a scale of such fees to the Minister for approval.</P>
      <P>Section 7 further provides that a person carrying on the business of an employment agency shall not charge any fee solely for agreeing to seek employment for another person or solely for agreeing to seek persons who will give or accept employment.</P>
      <P>Some employers, when applying for work permits to employ non EEA nationals, use the services of third parties, such as solicitors, accountants, foreign employment agencies etc. in handling the applications and the associated correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand from inquiries made, that it is <Col N="1378" /> the employment agencies abroad who charge employees for their services and that these agencies subsequently contact Irish employment agencies about placement here. The employees in question while still in their own country are offered work in Ireland by these foreign agencies at certain rates of pay, which are subsequently not honoured when they take up employment in this country. A remedy for this malpractice is outside the scope of Irish employee protection legislation and falls to be dealt with under common law. With a view to eliminating abuses my Department is currently reviewing the systems and procedures relating to the authorisation of employees from outside the European Economic Area.</P>
    <P>If Deputies are aware of any cases of malpractice against non-nationals I would urge them to notify my Department so that they can be fully investigated by the Labour Inspectorate of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The package of taxation and company law measures, introduced by us, in 1999 and 2000 to address problems, arising from the use of Irish-registered non-resident companies (IRNRs) for undesirable purposes, provide that all companies have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Registrar of Companies, in compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law.</P>
      <P>The key change is in the taxation area as a result of which all companies registered under the Companies Acts are now regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes, except for companies meeting specific criteria specified in the Finance Act, 1999. The effect of this is that the IRNR structure is no longer generally available. Going forward, therefore, only companies meeting Revenue's criteria can qualify for the IRNR status, under the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the position of companies in existence prior to the coming into operation of the new measures, Revenue have written to approximately 80,000 such companies. These are companies, which are incorporated in the State <Col N="1379" /> but which had not made contact with Revenue for the purposes of registering for tax, as required under the new taxation provisions.</P>
    <P>Approximately 33,000 of these companies have been struck off the Companies Office Register, either voluntarily or on foot of that office's procedures. Close on 1,100 companies have been struck off the register following notification (under the 1999 Finance Act provisions) to the Registrar by Revenue, that the companies had failed to furnish Revenue with the required information. A further list of such companies is being prepared by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Approximately 13,000 companies have registered for tax while 3,000 have given the required information to Revenue, but have indicated that they have not commenced trading. The position of the remaining companies remains under consideration by Revenue. There is no information available in the Companies Office on the number of IRNRs. Essentially, an IRNR is a company which is incorporated in Ireland under Irish company law but which is not deemed to be resident here for tax purposes, because it qualifies for the exceptions provided in the 1999 Finance Act. Consequently, Revenue alone determines which companies incorporated under the Companies Acts, qualify for IRNR status under the 1999 Finance Act. Last year, 41,217 companies in total, were struck off the register in comparison to 37,850 companies struck off in 1999.</P>
    <P>While I have seen newspaper reports in recent weeks in relation to alleged illegal activity by IRNRs, our Department has no direct involvement in any of these cases. It was the potential damage which such activity had that prompted the Government to take the measures that I have already described and which have so far borne the results outlined.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the current legislative measures will continue to be effectively enforced, through the ongoing co-operative efforts on the part of Revenue and the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, when established, to ensure that the IRNR problem is fully eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science for this very comprehensive and constructive report on science and technology. I have no hesitation in <Col N="1380" /> welcoming the report and its recommendations as an important contribution to the continuing development of appropriate policies and implementing mechanisms, in this very important area.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report, envisage a wide range of practical and imaginative measures to be taken mainly by the Department of Education and Science. In addition to the measures being taken by that Department, action will also be required by our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the various agencies responsible to both Departments, aimed at the strengthening of science education in Ireland and the promotion of closer co-operation between the education sector and industry.</P>
      <P>A range of measures have been put in place by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure that the education system retains the capacity to respond effectively to the changing needs of the economy and society in respect of scientific skills. The Minister Deputy Woods has established a task force on the physical sciences which will in the course of its work consider the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee's report.</P>
      <P>The recommendations, in so far as they relate to my responsibilities at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are being given the fullest consideration. Many of the areas identified in the report as requiring action are already being addressed either by both Departments and their agencies, or other bodies such as the Irish Council for Science Technology and Innovation (ICSTI). The report will provide the basis for a renewed impetus in these areas.</P>
      <P>On a more general note, this Government is very conscious of the need to introduce children to science subjects from the earliest possible age and in a manner which stimulates their interest and is appealing to them. If the demands and challenges of the knowledge-driven society are to be met, we need to actively encourage more young people to pursue careers in science and technology.</P>
      <P>The future competitiveness and success of the Irish economy will depend to a considerable extent on our capacity for research excellence and innovation. The scale of investment in research, technological development and innovation (RTDI) right across the educational sector and industry provided for in the national development plan, is clear evidence of this.</P>

      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment acts as a conduit for Irish companies who have made claims for compensation for losses arising from the Gulf War to the United Nations Compensation Commission UNCC. Fifteen companies based in Ireland submitted claims through this Department. Of those, one company subsequently withdrew its claim, and another is now pursuing its claim through its eurozone parent company. The 13 remaining claims were made in three different currencies, Irish pounds, pounds sterling and US dollars. The total values of the claims are as follows: IR£3,265,963; Stg£3,443,764; and US$35,954,038. So far, the UNCC has decided not to grant compensation in relation to six claims. It has granted some compensation in relation to one claim and the remaining six claims are still being processed.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to give information in relation to specific companies which would be private and commercially sensitive for those companies.</P>

The examinations of Kentford Securities Limited and Celtic Helicopters Limited are at an advanced stage and I am more than satisfied that these investigations will conclude fairly rapidly. The examinations of Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Co. Limited and College Trustees Limited are continuing. Arising from the volume and complexity of the documentation, as well as the continuing emergence of substantial quantities of significant documents, the investigations are continuing.

      <P>The report looks at a range of possibilities on future labour market trends in Ireland and the figures quoted are based on a particular growth scenario and on the time scale for the operation of the national development plan. In this connection the report estimates a possible gross immigration figure of 336,000 for the years to 2006 or 48,000 annually, much in line with trends in recent years. Central Statistics Office estimates suggest that annual gross immigration has ranged from 39,000 to 47,000 in the second half of the 1990s. This gross figure does not take into account outward migration which would clearly reduce the gross figure substantially. The report also estimated that perhaps 80% of immigrants would be either returning Irish or citizens of other EU states. The balance, or some 20-25% of the total, would come from third country, non-EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projections are based on a particular view of the relationship of economic growth to employment growth and the relationship which existed in the late 1990s may well change in the <Col N="1383" /> new decade. If employment opportunities are not generated in the economy at the predicted level, immigration will be lower. In light of changing circumstances in the economy and labour market, forecasts regarding immigration must be subject to re-assessment on a regular basis. I intend to have further work done in this area.</P>
    <P>Since the completion of this report, the Immigration Policy Advisory Committee, which includes representatives of the social partners, has been established under the aegis of my Department and held its inaugural meeting.

      <P>There has been a high level of adherence to the industrial peace and stabilisation clause of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Notwithstanding this there have been cases in both the public and private sectors where industrial action has occurred which is in breach of the PPF.</P>
      <P>In the talks which concluded in December on an adjustment to the terms PPF I was pleased to note that both ICTU and IBEC undertook to actively pursue adherence by their respective members to the key terms of the pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adherence has been underpinned by a National Implementation Body representing Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU which will meet quarterly to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of PPF. Where particular difficulties arise or are anticipated, this group can be convened at short notice. The difficulties which arose in relation to the PPF should serve <Col N="1385" /> to underline the benefits of our social partnership model. There is evidence to indicate that our growth rates are slowing down. We need to continue to work in harmony to build on the success to date and to protect what we have already achieved.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the estimate of £500 million per annum as the possible cost to Irish consumers of cartels in Ireland. This number is based on US Department of Justice estimates that cartels result in prices, on average, being 10% higher than would otherwise be the case. The estimate also assumes that one-tenth of all goods and services purchased by consumers in Ireland are affected by cartels. While it is difficult, for obvious reasons, to be precise about the possible scale of damage to consumers and to the economy generally caused by cartel behaviour, estimates such as that referred to in the question are useful in raising public awareness of the possible extent of the problem and of the need for continued vigilance in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the promotion of competition in all areas of the economy and to the removal of restraints on competition. Our competition legislation is already among the most stringent in the European Union and we are working on new legislation to strengthen it further. Tackling cartels is the main priority of <Col N="1386" /> the Competition Authority and I am currently considering proposals to strengthen the authority's enforcement capability by a further increase in staffing resources. These actions should send out the message that any cartel behaviour occurring in our economy will be dealt with vigorously.</P>

      <P>The costs incurred on recent company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to about £4.35 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff who are working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations are being borne by the vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>Of this amount, the cost of the inquiries into National Irish Bank Ltd., and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd., which are being undertaken by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, currently stands at about £2.7 million. None of this has yet been recovered from the two companies. As I have indicated on numerous occasions, I intend it is my intention to request the High Court to seek the full recoupment from the companies concerned of the significant costs of these inquiries on their completion.</P>
      <P>Of the balance of £1.65 million, the principal areas of expenditure have been incurred on the investigations of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., &ndash; £953,000; Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., &ndash; £204,000; Faxhill Homes Limited &ndash; £185,000; IIB Bank Ltd., &ndash; £88,000; and various other section 19 investigations &ndash; £45,000.</P>

      <P>In the context of the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, and the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, consultations will take place with the social partners through the PPF Standing Committee on the Labour Market, on the mainstreaming of essential services currently provided by the CE programme. The initial focus in this regard is on the education and health sectors.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising discussions with the Department of Education and Science aimed at transferring CE funding on schools schemes to that Department. The proposed transfer would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for schools support services over the past year. It would also provide a uniform and equitable system of funding for schools services which, thereafter, would be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. The precise nature of the scheme to be implemented is at an advanced stage of consideration and it is anticipated that discussions with the social partners on the final proposals will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Discussions are also under way with the Department of Health and Children to determine the potential to transfer current CE spending on services to persons with disabilities. These proposals will also be discussed with the social partners at the appropriate stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers, whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority's Road Accident Facts report for 1999, showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors' register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of <Col N="1390" /> insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board.</P>
    <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report it is hoped to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process. It is also intended to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of ensuring that the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It appears the implementation of EU legislation, the opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all EU member states, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The latest provisional trade figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that Ireland's exports to Egypt for the period from January to October 2000 totalled £157.2 million, a 20% increase on the same period in 1999. The major exports in this period were meat and meat preparations, computers and computer parts, miscellaneous food preparations, fish and seafood, essential oils and industrial machinery.</P>
      <P>The provisional figures indicate that Ireland's imports from Egypt for the period from January to October 2000 totalled £8.6 million, an increase of 48% on the same period in 1999. The main imports in this period were clothing, power generating machinery, textiles and metal manufactures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Egypt is one of the world's fastest growing developing markets with good potential for Irish exporters. Enterprise Ireland has identified the environmental technology, food process and packaging, health care and telecommunications <Col N="1391" /> sectors as having the most potential for Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>I hope to lead a trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland to Egypt later this spring at the invitation of Egypt's Minister Nazif, Minister of Communications and Information. The trade mission will include companies in the software and information technology sectors.</P>
    <P>Egypt is a significant oil producer and a rapidly growing gas producer. Egypt is currently placing great emphasis on expanding its existing food processing facilities and on establishing new markets for its products. While development of overseas markets for Egyptian exports is a matter primarily for the Egyptian authorities, the Government, through its various agencies, would be pleased to assist in identifying suitable potential Irish partner companies for Egyptian businesses.</P>

      <P>The Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying is examining workplace bullying in detail and is focusing on identifying the size of the problem and the employment sectors most at risk as well as developing proposals for practical programmes and strategies, both to prevent workplace bullying, and to provide a more appropriate co-ordinated response from the relevant state agencies.</P>
      <P>It was originally envisaged that the task force would report in March of last year. The original deadline proved too short for the work in hand and the chairman of the task force requested an extension of time, to which I agreed, in order to facilitate a proper fulfilment of its remit, in particular the first remit which is to identify the size of the problem in Ireland and the sectors most at risk.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving the report of the task force in the very near future.</P>

    <P>This amounts to a total of 13,271 redundancies for 2000. There were 1,310 notified redundancies for the month of January, 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> Many of the recently announced major job losses in overseas owned plants in Ireland arise from restructuring, with activities at the lower end of the value-added chain being phased out as they become uneconomic.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's strategy is to encourage Irish plants of global companies to move up the value-added chain into higher skilled and better-paid jobs, thus enhancing their international competitiveness and employment. In this context also, a major part of IDA efforts is focused on embedding existing overseas-owned companies more firmly in the economy with a view to having strategically independent operations in Ireland within their corporate structures worldwide.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and other state agencies are intensifying their efforts to attract replacement projects to areas affected by major job losses and to assist the development and expansion of existing industry in those areas. Every effort is being made to assist the workers affected to find alternative employment and to provide retraining, where appropriate, to enhance employment prospects.</P>

      <P>Government enterprise policy, as well as key policy instruments such as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness or PPF, are concerned to keep our economy competitive in a global context which is experiencing continuous, exponential change. In order to do so Irish industry must show willingness to modernise, adapt and to ascend the value chain. The policy focus lays particular emphasis on strengthening our main enterprise sectors, in particular, small businesses; on developing the services sector by encouraging investment in new technologies and in research and development projects with commercial opportunities; and on providing constant skills upgrading, life-long learning and by addressing labour shortages. Recent Irish economic performance, including our standing in world league competitiveness tables, clearly signals that our industry overall is modernising and adapting. We cannot, however, be complacent. There will be casualties who fail to see the signs. We must continue to deploy our policy instruments so as to minimise the casualties and provide support for progressive businesses to prosper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland conducts some trade with virtually every country in the world, even if it is at an extremely low level in some cases. The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, supports the development of Irish exports by working with individual companies to move into markets where they are not already active, even if other Irish companies are already active there; by working with companies to improve their market penetration in markets where they are already active; and by seeking to encourage companies to take advantage of opportunities in markets where Irish industry generally has not had planned, strategic activity previously. For exporters it is important to take a strategic approach to market development, and as a Government it is important for us to take the same kind of strategic approach. While in the past year Enterprise Ireland has worked with many companies individually to develop their market strategies, it has also worked to ensure that the level of activity of Irish companies in some key markets is developed. Examples of such activities during 2000 include the following: European/Mediterranean markets (including Egypt, Greece, Israel and Turkey) &ndash;<Col N="1398" /> A specialist business unit &ndash; Market Development &ndash; Europe was established within EI to assist its clients to develop their business in European-Mediterranean markets, where Enterprise Ireland does not currently have a local office. During 2000, the market development team assisted 18 companies in four markets &ndash; Egypt, Greece, Israel and Turkey &ndash; to establish a presence in these markets, bringing the total number of companies active in these markets to 153.</P>
      <P>Mexico &ndash; Enterprise Ireland in November 2000 hosted a Seminar on Business Opportunities in Mexico. The seminar was organised jointly by Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Mexico Business Association and the Mexican Embassy. The event was designed to inform the business and educational sector of some of the opportunities now opening up in Mexico arising from the opening up of the Mexican economy to the rest of the world through, <i>inter alia</i>, the Mexico-European Union Free Trade Agreement MEFTA, which came into force on the 1 July 2000.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland expects to see growing opportunities in Mexico for Irish companies, across a wide spectrum of industry. However, the openings are currently confined to certain sectors, and would appear to lie in software, processed food and education.</P>
      <P>India &ndash; In September 2000 Enterprise Ireland launched a new guide  &ndash; Business Opportunities in India, A Guide for Irish Software and IT companies. The guide outlines the opportunities available for Irish companies who are targeting the Indian marketplace. Significant potential exists for increasing trade between Ireland and India particularly through software, information technology and e-business partnerships.</P>
      <P>China &ndash; the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in September 2000 led the largest ever trade mission from Ireland to China. In all, 51 companies participated to explore the opportunities to develop new markets as China continues to open up its economy to foreign investment. The visit represented a very important part of the Government's Asia strategy for the long-term development of foreign earnings in Asia. The strategy identifies China and Japan as the key Asian markets with a very strong focus on China in particular. China's economic growth and impending accession to the WTO, together with its drive to reform the state sector, its privatisation programme, and the massive investment being made to develop the western regions of China, create excellent trade opportunities for Irish companies. These opportunities exist in particular Irish businesses in the software and telecommunications, education services and construction services sectors. Bilateral trade between Ireland and China was worth an estimated £608 million in 1999, with a strong balance in China's favour. Irish exports to China were £93 million, an increase of 57% on the previous year. Imports from China were £514 million in 1999, up 2%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> New Opportunities/Existing Markets &ndash; In addition to identifying new opportunities in new, underdeveloped markets, Enterprise Ireland also encourages client companies to exploit new opportunities in existing markets. A recent example was Eur:opp 2003; during 2000, when EI launched a strategy to seriously ramp up the numbers of companies selling in excess of £5 million annually into the eurozone. The new strategy aims to double, from 55 to 110, the numbers of EI client companies selling in excess of £5 million annually into Europe. Continental Europe represents Irish industry's largest potential market. Europe has 290 million customers, yet only 29% of Irish company exports are sold into this market. Eur:opp 2003 is taking a series of actions designed to speed up the rate of entry by Irish owned firms into the eurozone and to provide them with the skills necessary to transact business in Europe. These actions include: the establishment of incubator units in seven locations across Europe; an initiative to increase the number of European buyers coming to Ireland; selling skills workshops; language and culture training; the provision of targeted market intelligence; and a range of actions which will strengthen the competitiveness of Irish companies.</P>
    <P>During 2000 Enterprise Ireland intensified its drive to focus client companies on aggressive long-term export marketing strategies. As part of the process almost 500 companies participated in 30 trade missions to overseas markets and 2,500 international buyers were brought to Ireland to develop supply partnerships with Irish companies. In addition 300 companies participated in 35 international trade fairs. Exports to the British and North American markets continued to grow strongly and the establishment of a permanent presence overseas by individual firms is critical to the development of new market opportunities. There was a very positive response to the establishment by EI of incubator units in the US where demand now exceeds supply. These units provide technology companies entering the US market for the first time with a base from which to operate until they acquire their own facilities.</P>

      <P>The Government endeavours to ensure that industrial expansion takes place in a way that achieves a reasonable spread and availability of employment opportunities. This process is undertaken in a way <Col N="1400" /> which seeks to avail of and develop the resources and potential of each region, including its skills base. The maximum grant aid rates payable by the industrial development agencies in respect of new industrial investment are becoming increasingly differentiated on a regional basis, under the regional aid rates approved by the EU Commission for the period 2000 to 2006. Under this regime, the maximum aid rate for firms in the Border, Midland and West regions is 40% for large firms with an additional 15% for SMEs. The maximum aid rate in Dublin is 17.5% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs. The rest of the country is currently in transition from rates which were close to the BMW rates in 2000 to rates which will be around 20% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs by 2004. The IDA has intensified its efforts to achieve a better distribution of overseas investment into the regions. Overall, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new greenfield investment projects have been secured for the Objective One regions, which is ahead of expectations in the three year target set out by IDA at the beginning of the year. The jobs will come on stream over the next few years. This is a strong and very encouraging result in that it came from intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the IDA working in close partnership with the local authorities and the third level colleges and universities in the regions. The initiatives that are being taken in relation to skill shortages are similarly availing of the potential of the third level colleges and universities across the country.</P>
      <P>Work is also ongoing across a number of Departments to formulate a national spatial strategy. This will facilitate the further development of regional strategies that will contribute in a meaningful way to sustained national development and improved quality of life.</P>

      <P>No formal mechanism is in place to monitor the overseas investments of the agencies clients or Irish firms generally. However, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development would, of course, usually become aware of such investments by their client companies and would often have a supportive role to play in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past ten years or so have seen globalisation and international investment gather increasing momentum. Our industrial policy has successfully capitalised on this trend and the benefits to our economy of foreign direct investment are well <Col N="1401" /> known. At the same time we have been placing a special emphasis on helping to build competitive, world class indigenous enterprises that can successfully compete in demanding world markets. Both economic growth and the ability to enhance the sustainable competitive advantage of indigenous enterprise are based on strengthening our linkages with the world economy through expanding international trade and investment.</P>
    <P>Building indigenous firms with the scale and capacity to successfully compete internationally requires investments in markets abroad. Enterprises make these investments for sound strategic reasons and we have numerous examples of world class Irish multinationals that have become visibly successful by investing abroad to better serve their customers and win international market share. Outward direct investment is beneficial to our economy across a range of indicators, including export performance and diversification, employment and pay levels at parent companies, company profitability and growth, access to international capital markets and the development of globally minded management teams.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development play an important role in providing advice and other forms of non grant support to indigenous firms that have a strategic objective to internationalise their activities. This advice is often provided both formally and informally through EI's network of overseas offices and indeed sometimes through our embassies abroad. The assistance includes expert advice and networking services and assistance with overseas trade and investment missions.</P>

      <P>The Government supports the development of the indigenous sector by providing a wide range of financial supports to help companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to profitable sales, exports and employment. These supports, which are administered by Enterprise Ireland, include employment, marketing, technology research and development, fixed asset, business and training grants and the provision of equity finance. All supports provided by the agency must comply with State aids rules.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland's approach to the development of the indigenous sector focuses on identifying the business needs and challenges facing its client companies in the competitive global market. It provides a streamlined and flexible response to those needs and challenges by offering support and advice on a basis which relates directly to the key strategic business functions of firms, that is, strategy assessment and formulation; research, development and design; production and operations; marketing; human resources and finance.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I launched a new Enterprise Ireland initiative to support regional development by indigenous firms. That initiative will aim to assist indigenous firms in regional locations to develop and grow through exports and by increasing their competitiveness. It will aim to increase the number of high potential start-ups in regional locations and it targets increasing the number of firms from Dublin who will locate their expansions in the regions. The agency now has a target to get 30 expansions by Dublin-based firms into the regions in the period 2001-03. That figure compares with five such expansions into the regions in the previous three years.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland's approach involves a stepped approach to company development which includes a detailed analysis of a company's requirements against specific goals, determining the level and need for state support, and targeting funds towards providing solutions to the real needs of client companies rather than the administration of many and diverse programmes. As Enterprise Ireland's approach is focused on meeting the needs of companies as identified by them I have no plans to introduce a new scheme to facilitate relocations.</P>

      <P>The industrial development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are continuing to achieve their targets for attracting additional employment and inward investment to this country. Preliminary results for the year 2000 show a record number of jobs being created by the industrial development agencies with 23,300 jobs being created in IDA Ireland &ndash; supported companies, 16,500 jobs created in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies while Shannon Development-supported companies created 2,200 jobs. These results speak for themselves. However, with a rapidly changing global economy, which impacts strongly on Ireland, continuous review of policy and of the environment for the development of existing and new companies is essential. Going forward, the agencies will be required to sustain enterprise development in an environment characterised by high levels of employment, the need for new economic infrastructure, the increasing importance of skill formation and technological development and growing international competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agencies have recognised these changes and have formulated strategies to enable them to continue supporting the development of the enterprise sector. A major agency objective is to enhance the competitiveness of agency client-companies, the better to enable them to withstand the increasingly competitive pressures arising from the global economy. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, this is achieved by assisting indigenous client companies to move up the value chain, while IDA Ireland does this by striving to raise the quality of both new and existing overseas companies and by strengthening their sustainability and strategic value in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland, which also has responsibility for the food and natural resources industry, is actively marketing Ireland as a location for leading edge food products. In the midwest region, Shannon Development is also focused on promoting higher quality, sustainable employment. A further consideration, in the evolving policies of the agencies, is the Government commitment, contained in the national development plan, to refocus industrial development away from the Dublin and eastern region towards a more equitable spread nationally. A commitment in IDA Ireland's current strategy is that at least 50% of all new greenfield jobs will be in Objective One regions, a commitment which was delivered on by IDA Ireland during the year 2000. Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards are also committed to <Col N="1404" /> developing indigenous industry and to regional dispersal. Enterprise Ireland has deployed over 100 staff in its regional network and works closely with all development organizations in the regions, as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro-actively facilitate an integrated approach to regional development. The effectiveness of the agencies in addressing all of these issues into the future will be kept under review and I am confident that the agencies will continue to play a pivotal role in the development of our economy over the coming years.</P>

It is not possible, therefore, to consider his boat for licensing under the special scheme. Licensing of the vessel will, therefore, have to be addressed in accordance with the normal conditions and requirements of licensing policy, including the removal of capacity from the Sea Fishing Boat Register. A for a further scheme for unregistered small fishing vessels if demonstrably warranted would require EU approval. My Department is examining the objective necessity for pursuing the case for a further scheme with the European Commission, in the context of the overall circumstances of the inshore fisheries sector, as well as the implications for overall fleet management policy.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 241 of 3 October 2000 in which I explained that there is no formal approval process which allows for my Department to endorse the submerged vessel locator buoy which has been designed by Mr. Kelly. Consequently, there is no mechanism by which my Department can test this device. However, I welcome the initiative shown by Mr. Kelly in developing this product and I am anxious <Col N="1406" /> that its potential usefulness as a safety device should receive the fullest consideration. In this regard, I have directed that his concept be brought to the attention of the Fishing Vessel Safety Implementation Group and the Fishing Vessel Safety Liaison Group, which were established by my Department to assess progress and to identify priority areas for action with regard to implementing the recommendations of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group which published its report in 1996. Both groups comprise representatives of the relevant divisions within my Department, the Health and Safety Authority, BIM and in the case of the liaison group, representatives of the main fishing organisations. I have asked the members of these groups to examine Mr. Kelly's proposal and to advise me if the carriage of such a locator buoy would merit consideration as a statutory requirement.</P>
      <P>I will ensure that the Deputy is informed of the outcome of this consultation in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 December 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a comprehensive peace agreement in Algiers bringing an end to their border war. The agreement was the result of intensive negotiations that had taken place under the auspices of the Organisation for African Unity, the United States and the <Col N="1407" /> European Union. Under its terms, Ethiopia and Eritrea accept the appointment of an arbitration commission to deal with border demarcation and delimitation and a second commission to deal with compensation issues. Both sides also agree to repatriate all prisoners of war and to investigate the causes of the conflict.</P>
      <P>The international community strongly supports the agreement and is very active in monitoring its implementation. The United Nations has authorised the deployment of a 4,200 strong force &ndash; UNMEE &ndash; to monitor the ceasefire and to assist in ensuring the observance of the security commitments agreed by the parties &ndash; Security Council Resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000. It is expected that the full deployment of troops will shortly be completed.</P>
      <P>The Government warmly welcomes these positive developments and the progress that has been made since December in implementing some elements of the Algiers Agreement. However, we are concerned that difficulties that have arisen in establishing a temporary security zone &ndash; TSZ &ndash; between the two countries could potentially delay UNMEE from fully carrying out its mandate. The Secretary General's special representative, Joseph Legwaila, has presented compromise proposals to both countries on the limits of the TSZ and it is hoped that they will shortly be agreed. It is essential that the parties rapidly resolve this matter and proceed to take other steps envisioned in the Algiers Agreement, including the complete redeployment of troops, the establishment of a direct air corridor between Addis Ababa and Asmara and the conclusion of status of forces agreements.</P>
      <P>The agreement offers the real prospect of a lasting peace to the war weary peoples of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Lasting peace and stability will enable both governments to devote their full attention to addressing the enormous development needs facing their societies. I urge all political leaders to continue to show the courage necessary to ensure that the opportunities created by the agreement are built upon.</P>
      <P>Ireland recently contributed $75,000 to the OAU liaison mission to the United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has bilateral aid programmes in six priority countries in Africa. Ethiopia is one such country; Eritrea is not. The country programme budget allocated for Ethiopia in 2001 is £20 million. As has been the case in previous years both countries stand to benefit from Irish emergency and humanitarian assistance, if deemed necessary, and for funding under the NGO cofinancing scheme. As the NGO cofinancing scheme committee has met just once in 2001 only a small number of grant applications have been approved &ndash; three from Ethiopia, £106,656 in total, and one from Eritrea, £73,084. We will remain fully supportive of the peace process and will continue to assist wherever practicable.</P>

      <P>Organic farmers participating in the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; can avail of substantial additional payments under one of the supplementary measures in the scheme. The purpose of this supplementary measure is to encourage producers in REPS to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. The payments available are as follows: holdings greater than three hectares and up to 40 hectares &ndash; in conversion, 181 per hectare; full organic status, 91 per hectare; holdings less than three hectares &ndash; in conversion, 242 per hectare; full organic status, 121 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, an organic farmer can receive up to £5,702 a year, on top of his or her basic REPS payment of up to £4,757, while a holding is in conversion to full organic status, and up to £2,867 extra in full organic status. Some £17 million has been paid to organic farmers under a similar supplementary measure of the previous REP scheme and I am hopeful that payments under the new scheme, which commenced on 27 November last, will considerably surpass that level as increasing numbers of farmers become aware of the opportunities offered by the expansion of the market for organic produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national development plan, £6 million has been allocated for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. This funding will be used towards the development of the organic sector by providing grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities <Col N="1411" /> for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. I expect that details of grants available under the regional operational programmes will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 Committee recommended that an organic development committee be established to draw up a coherent strategy for the development of the organic sector. I accepted that recommendation and I gave the committee the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To recommend a coherent development strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets; and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity.</P>

Interested parties who are not represented on the committee have been invited to make submissions to it, so to ensure that its deliberations can have regard to as wide a range of views as possible.

      <P>In the period to 2006, Leader activity will be delivered through two mechanisms, being the EU Leader+ programme and the national rural development programme. In line with EU Commission guidelines, my Department submitted the draft Leader+ oper<Col N="1413" /> ational programme to the Commission in November. The programme is currently being examined and the Commission has a period of five months for consideration before issuing a conclusion. Negotiations are currently in progress with my Department with a view to obtaining approval for the programme at the earliest date possible to clear the way for commencement of Leader activity. The Commission will also give final approval for the national rural development programme.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the process for selection of rural development groups to deliver the programmes is under way. An independent consultant is examining the 89 business plan applications with a view to making recommendations to my Department.

Having regard to resources currently allocated to Leader, every effort will be made to ensure that rural areas having real need will be covered by the Leader programmes.</P>
      <P>As with programmes generally, Leader activity in the period to 2006 will be in the context of the determination of the operation of local development programmes as a whole and account will have to be taken of the conclusions in the report of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems. This requires that overlap in delivery by local programmes is avoided in order to minimise duplication and maximise the allocated resources.</P>

      <P>Meitheal Forbatha na Gaeltachta Teoranta, MFG, is one of the 34 Leader local action groups appointed to deliver the Leader II operational programme in local areas. The group provides service to the Gaeltacht areas including the Donegal Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Leader group appointed was allocated an operating budget by my Department. Over the period of the programme to 1999, the amount allocated to MFG was £3.113 million, of which MFG applied £1.038 million to its Tír Chonnaill group. This amount was allocated as follows: £198,333.33 for administration purposes; £130,666.67 for animation and £708,666.67 for projects. The latter amount was allocated to fund 162 projects. Just 15 projects were not funded. A <Col N="1414" /> list of the projects has been forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Funding not utilised is reallocated. Under the Leader II programme, Leader groups have to date utilised 98% of available funding. No EU funding allocated has been returned to the EU Commission to date. To the extent that this might occur in course of finalisation of the Leader II programme financial aspects any such sum is likely to be small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Member states can retain the zero rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, but cannot introduce any new ones. Therefore, it is not possible for me to zero rate the supply or installation of biocycle units.</P>
      <P>In addition, under EU VAT law there are certain options for applying a reduced rate to certain goods and services, however, there is no mechanism under EU VAT law for Ireland which would allow me to apply a reduced rate of VAT on biocycle units. The sale of these units is chargeable in Ireland at the standard rate of VAT which in my recent budget I reduced by 1% to 20% which should help reduce the cost of them.</P>
      <P>However, the supply and installation of biocycle units by a contractor would be taxable at 12.5% if the cost excluding VAT to the contractor in carrying out the work exceeds two thirds of the total cost to the contractor, exclusive of VAT. There is no rate of VAT of 12% in effect in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the overall budget tax measures will substantially improve the net income position of taxpayers. The major tax improvements of general application are: the increase in the personal allowances of £800 single-£1,600 married to £5,500 single-£11,000 married; the widening of the standard band to £20,000 single, £29,000 married one earner and £40,000 married two earners; and the 2% reductions in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of other tax-free allowances available in respect of people with disabilities. These are the incapacitated child's allowance, the dependant relative allowance, and the allowance for employment of carer for an incapacitated person. In addition, there are a number of further tax measures from which disabled persons can benefit.</P>
      <P>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of various defined health expenses. The disabled drivers scheme, details of which are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, (SI No 353 of 1994) provide valuable benefits to those severely and permanently disabled persons who qualify under its term. Under the scheme, a new car may be purchased every two years free of VAT and vehicle registration tax, subject to certain monetary limits. In addition, the annual road tax is not charged and the qualifying person is eligible for the provision per annum of 2,728 litres of road fuel free of excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VAT Act, 1972, as amended, provides for the application of a zero rate of VAT on a range of medical equipment and appliances for example, hearing aids. Certain disabled persons may be entitled to a refund of VAT for certain <Col N="1419" /> equipment which is not zero rated under the VAT (Refund of Tax) Order (No. 15) 1981 (SI No 428 of 1981). Further information on operation of this order is available from Revenue Commissioners VAT Repayments (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
    <P>Income arising from the investment of compensation payments made by the courts to those who are totally and permanently incapacitated is free from income tax. There is a special exemption from income tax in respect of income derived from leases for incapacitated farmers.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new reliefs or the extension of existing ones. Tax reliefs by their very nature reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system much more difficult. Government policy in recent years has been to reduce the burden of taxation to reward effort and to improve the incentive to take up employment. This has benefited all taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Charges can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
      <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, and regulations made under the Act set out the statutory requirements in relation to the placement and care of children in services operated by the health boards themselves and by other service providers acting on behalf of health boards.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the 1991 Act requires each health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Section 3 also requires health boards to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration and to have regard to the wishes of the child.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Act, health boards have a duty to take a child into care on a voluntary basis if the child requires care and protection, and is unlikely to receive it unless taken into care, provided the parents or persons acting in loco parentis consent to this arrangement.</P>
      <P>Separate arrangements apply where the parents or persons acting in loco parentis do not voluntarily agree to a child being taken into care under section 4. These can be summarised as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Act provides for the making of emergency care orders; Part IV provides for the making of interim care orders, care orders and supervision orders; and Part IV &ndash; section 16 &ndash; also places a duty on a health board to initiate proceedings where a child is considered to require care or protection. Section 24 restates, in respect of proceedings regarding the care and protection of children, that the welfare of the child shall be regarded as the first and paramount consideration and that regard shall be had to the wishes of the child. Against this broad statutory framework, health boards act in the best interests <Col N="1422" /> of the child concerned and deal with each individual case on its merits.</P>
    <P>Where a health board takes a child into care in accordance with the provisions of the 1991 Act, it has two main options in regard to the placement of the child &ndash; either foster care or residential care. Both types of care are regulated by Part VI of the Act and associated regulations.</P>
    <P>In regard to residential care, a health board can either place a child in a residential home which it operates itself or it can place the child in a children's residential centre, that is, a registered centre which is not operated by a health board. Residential homes are subject to inspection by the social services inspectorate under section 69 of the Act and children's residential centres are subject to inspection by the health board in whose functional area they are located in accordance with Article 18 of the Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996, these regulations also incorporate a Guide to Good Practice in Children's Residential Centres.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the area boards in the eastern region have been placing children in houses run by the child care division, as distinct from the separate security division, of the organisation referred to by the Deputy. At present eight children are being cared for under this arrangement. This service is availed of as an interim measure as the boards are currently developing a wide range of new and alternative services for children and young people in the region. All staff employed in the child care division of the organisation concerned have obtained Garda clearance and about 50% have a recognised qualification in child care. Other staff have relevant qualifications for working with young people.</P>
    <P>Regular reviews are held in the case of children placed with this organisation, a teacher has been appointed to provide daily tuition and prepare the young people for mainstream education. A staff consultant/trainer has also been engaged by the organisation concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority. Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board in order for the grant to be approved. Accordingly, the Deputy's questions have been referred to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that, at 11 January 2001, some 14 occupational therapists were employed by the South Eastern Health Board. I am aware that there are staff shortages in the therapy grades in the health service. In order to address these shortages, my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including occupational therapists. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals made recommendations in relation to an enhanced career structure for occupational therapists. This has resulted in a large number of occupational therapists being upgraded. It has also led to the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy grades. The creation of this grade will allow for career progression for those who do not want to move into management. It will also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the professions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 November last I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service and addressing shortages in specialist areas. As part of the initiative, I made funding available for nursing courses in specified specialised areas of clinical practice in order to address the critical shortage of nurses in those areas.</P>
      <P>In particular, I provided funding for the establishment of new courses in hospitals outside Dublin, including the Cork hospitals, Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. This is being done to arrest the drift of specialist nurses from the acute Dublin hospitals. The availability of new programmes in hospitals around the country will free up places in the Dublin hospitals which can be allocated to Dublin based nurses.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative, nurses or midwives undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. They will also be entitled to have their fees paid in full in return for a commitment on their part to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for 12 months following completion of the course. These arrangements are effective from the current academic year and will apply to post-registration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency; critical care, including intensive care, coronary care and burns; and peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the initiative does not cover all specialist courses and that nurses or midwives undertaking courses not included in this initiative often do so at their own expense. However, the areas included in the initiative have been identified as those where the shortage of specialist <Col N="1426" /> nurses is most acute. It is for this reason that I decided to concentrate resources available to me in the current year on those areas. Consequently, I am not in a position to provide funding for specialist courses in the area referred to by the Deputy. However, I have asked my Department to monitor the situation closely in the context of service needs.</P>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment/retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses at an annual cost of some £9 million: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for back-to-practice courses; and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the £8.5 million which was allocated to the health agencies for continuing nurse education between 1994 and 1999. Individual nurses and midwives who are not eligible for funding under the schemes announced by me may apply to their employers for funding from the separate continuing nurse education budget available to their employers.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are set out in the following tabular statement. These figures have been extracted from the annual financial statements of the health boards.

However, it is unlikely that these figures will change significantly on audit.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> The grade category of management-administrative also includes staff who are of direct service to patients, such as consultants' secretaries, community welfare officers, out-patient department personnel, ward clerks, medical records personnel and telephonists who are engaged in front line duties.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the purpose of many of the staff classified as management/ administrative is to support front line professionals in carrying out their duties more <Col N="1428" /> efficiently. Health professionals, especially consultants and nurse managers, require clerical support and request such appointments on an ongoing basis. The strengthening of the accountability of health boards in the context of the accountability legislation of 1996 has led to the strengthening of finance departments also. In addition, improvements in risk management, human resource management and health and safety practices have contributed to a growth in the management/administrative area. The growth in the numbers at management/administrative level must be viewed in this context.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility &ndash; category 1, that is, medical card holders &ndash; or limited eligibility &ndash; category 2 &ndash; for health services. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is two fold &ndash; first, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes and, second, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a <Col N="1430" /> subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations, 1993.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. The Deputy will be aware of the shortcomings in the operation of the scheme highlighted in the Ombudsman's recently published report and a number of measures have already been taken to deal with some of these problems. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever further measures may be necessary arising from the findings of this review and the report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <Quest>the steps the South Eastern Health Board is taking to determine the number of applicants who were incorrectly assessed for nursing home subventions within its area; if the South Eastern Health Board has been instructed by his Department to carry out such an assessment and to reimburse those involved; if funds were allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for this purpose in the past; and if so, the number of applicants who were reimbursed.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the assessment of family circumstances of subvention applicants, as well as the assessment of their means which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing these means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid.</P>
      <P>An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in the 1998 letters of determination to six of the eight health boards, where the regulations relating to the income disregard were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The sum allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for this purpose was £610,000.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of the income disregard arrears. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result of the easing of family circumstances regulations in 1996. The funding was intended to address both problems and to meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting with the Office of the Ombudsman in December 1999, the Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears. The Department took the matter up with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue the matter. As far as the South Eastern Health Board is concerned, I have been advised by the board that it has made retrospective payments in respect of 144 cases to persons currently resident in nursing homes and arrangements are being made to pay arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible and I have instructed my Department to pursue this with the health boards concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that arrangements are being made to make appropriate payments in respect of nursing home patients and their families who may have been affected by the family circumstances regulations prior to their amendment in 1999. This amendment removed the provision which allowed health boards assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. A group representing the Department and the health boards/ERHA has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis. I should add that the legal advice available to me is that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nevertheless, in the interests of <Col N="1435" /> fairness to the people concerned, the Minister and I have decided on this course of action. As this will be a complex exercise involving difficult issues of traceability, it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines &ndash; ex manufacture &ndash; in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in <Col N="1436" /> line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
      <P>Considerable discrepancies can exist between the prices of individual products between Ireland and the UK, particularly if the comparison is made on the basis of generic equivalents. There is a vibrant generic market in the UK where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition that affects prices charged for generic medicines.</P>
      <P>Under the GMS scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price, that is, the ingredient cost of the drug dispensed by them plus an appropriate dispensing fee. In the case of private prescriptions of medicines reimbursed under the drug payment scheme, the cost reimbursed by the State to pharmacists covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost &ndash; normally 50% of the trade price &ndash; and a standard dispensing fee. My Department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing, which has been established by custom and practice over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála is a statutory independent body established under section 3 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, with responsibility for the determination of appeals, references and certain other matters, including appeals in relation to licences under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990. Section 11(5) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, provides that the board shall, subject to compliance with planning legislation, regulate its own procedure and business. However, the 1983 Act provides that the Minister may require the board to keep him informed of the arrangements it makes for the regulation of its procedure and business. The Minister is statutorily prohibited from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the board is or may be concerned. Like other semi-State bodies, the board is required to submit its accounts, having first been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and an annual report to the appropriate Minister, in this case the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. These are then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The board's 1999 annual report and accounts were recently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the chairman of An Bord Pleanála has, on occasion, appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The board was established to give independent consideration of planning authorities' decisions on planning applications. In considering an appeal, the board considers all submissions on the file together with the inspector's report and recommendation and determines the case as if the application had been made to it in the first place. Under sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, the board may seek further information or documentation from any party to an appeal or any person who made submissions or observations on an appeal and may determine the appeal having regard to any such information or documentation submitted. In cases where additional information is received and the board considers it necessary in the interest of natural justice, any such documentation received is made available to all the parties to the appeal.</P>
      <P>Any issue of liability arising from a decision of the board is a matter for the courts. However, planning permission on its own is not necessarily enough for a development to proceed. Any forms of development likely to give rise to significant environmental pollution will also require an appropriate licence from the relevant pollution control authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged over 66 years. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare-type payments. It provides free travel on all public transport services with certain restrictions on travel at peak hours in main cities. In contrast, the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme provides only half-rate fares for its senior citizens using a limited number of transport companies.</P>
      <P>The cross-Border free travel scheme was introduced between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 1995. It provides free travel on cross-Border routes for pass holders of both jurisdictions. This scheme applies only to cross-Border journeys and not travel exclusively within each jurisdiction. Since the scheme's inception, approximately 1.5 million cross-Border trips have been undertaken at a cost of over £11 million. In 2000 the cost of the scheme is estimated to be £2.3 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy proposes that pensioners living in Armagh should be allowed to commence their journeys in Dundalk instead of in Northern Ireland. It would not be feasible to define specific towns for this purpose nor would it be possible to confine such an extension only to pensioners resident in Armagh. Therefore, any expansion of this nature would, in effect, involve the extension of the free travel scheme to all Northern Ireland pensioners on a unilateral basis. This would have significant cost and administrative implications.</P>
      <P>In this regard, it should be noted that my Department is responsible for 100% of the cost of the journey in the Republic for both free travel pass holders and Northern Ireland concession card holders, the balance, that is 50%, of the cost of cross-Border journeys in Northern Ireland for Northern Ireland concession card holders and 100% of the cost of cross-Border journeys on trains for both northern and southern pass holders.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is a residence-based scheme, similar to all social welfare services. The cross-Border free travel scheme was introduced as there are common road and rail networks, and a much smaller population than our own. Any extension of the scheme would have significant administrative and cost implications that could only be examined on a joint basis between the two jurisdictions and in the context of budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>The fuel allowance is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 a week, £8 in smokeless zones, is made to eligible households during the period from mid-October to late-April.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension at the reduced weekly rate of £85.20. One of the conditions for receipt of a fuel allowance is that the household must not have a combined income of more than £30 per week above the appropriate maximum weekly rate of contributory pension, in this case £89.10. The person concerned is also in receipt of a British widow's pension which, when combined with her widow's contributory pension, brings her above the income limit to qualify for the fuel allowance. She does not qualify for the allowance and has been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned has special heating needs and is unable to provide for those needs, she may qualify for a heating payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare-type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience <Col N="1442" /> programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Restrictions apply at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. In this regard, CIE has expressed grave reservations about any relaxation in time restrictions, as many of its services are already operating at full capacity, even in off-peak hours. There are no peak time travel restrictions on the DART or suburban rail services and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published in April last year, by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin, noted that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has brought this recommendation to the attention of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>With regard to free travel companion passes, these have been available since 1990 to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to other people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone. In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
    <P>Given the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a free travel companion pass should be issued to all people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone. This would standardise the qualifying conditions for a companion pass for both invalidity pension and disability allowance. The review's proposal in this regard, which has expenditure implications, will be considered in context of future budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The recent budget provided for the extension of maternity and adoptive leave by four weeks to 18 weeks from early April. The Government subsequently decided to bring forward this measure. Entitlement to maternity benefit is linked to entitlement to maternity leave. To qualify for maternity benefit an employed woman must be entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, must have her expected date of confinement certified by her doctor and must satisfy certain PRSI conditions. A self-employed woman must satisfy certain PRSI conditions and provide certification from her doctor.</P>
      <P>Extending the duration of maternity and adoptive leave requires amendment of both the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, by way of regulations. However these regulations, which are to be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, require a positive motion of approval to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the amendments can take effect. I understand it is hoped that a resolution approving the draft will be passed by Dáil Éireann later today and in the Seanad on Thursday next.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of both the Maternity Protection Act and the Adoptive Leave Act the extended duration of maternity and adoptive leave will only apply to people who give their employers the required four weeks' notice of their intention to take the extended leave following the approval of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Provision for the extension of maternity benefit to 18 weeks is included in the Social Welfare Bill which will be before the House shortly. These provisions will become effective from the date on which the extended leave becomes effective. In addition to the extension of paid maternity leave, the budget also provides for an increase of four weeks' additional unpaid maternity leave and an extension of all employment rights, including the award of credited contributions for any additional maternity leave taken. Regulations governing the award of these credited contributions will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Further improvements announced in the budget include an increase of £8 in the minimum rates of payment for maternity and adoptive benefit from £90.70 to £98.70 a week and a £10.20 increase in the maximum rates from £172.80 to £183. These increases will come into effect from 2 April 2001.</P>

The person concerned was not in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment prior to participation in a third level course of study and is not, therefore, eligible for the allowance.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 32 of 31 May 2000, my view was that it would be highly desirable to undertake an environmental appraisal of the likely impacts of any reinstatement works on the environment at the site location to ensure no significant adverse effect would result from such works. At the High Court in July 2000, the legal team acting on my behalf requested time for the preparation of an environmental impact appraisal, but Mr. Justice Flood was not prepared to countenance a delay while an appraisal was undertaken. He indicated very clearly that the intended to make an order for reinstatement on that day. I have no option, but to comply with the valid and clear instructions of the High Court. It is not open to me, therefore, to delay reinstatement pending an environmental assessment.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental review group, chaired by an official from my Department, is examining the reliefs available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. The scheme provides reliefs from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and from excise duty on fuel for drivers and passengers who are severely and permanently physically disabled.</P>
      <P>While a sizeable number of submissions had been made to the group prior to May 2000, the review group placed advertisements in the national newspapers in early May 2000 seeking written submissions from members of the public in order that it would benefit from as full a consultation process as possible. Arising out of the advertisements, 250 submissions were received, reflecting over 60 different disabilities. The review group also held 22 individual hearings between May and September 2000 with representatives of various organisations and with a number of persons who had indicated a desire to make oral submissions to it.</P>
      <P>The insights gained from an analysis of the oral and written submissions, when added to the knowledge already gained from the submissions which it received from members of the public and public representatives, will inform the work of the group. The group is examining practice in other countries and certain technical aspects of the scheme.</P>

    <P>Extensive consultations have taken place. Due to the complex nature of the issues raised it was important to ensure all people with disabilities and interested parties had an opportunity to contribute to the review.

    <P>It is intended that the review group will report to the Minister for Finance on its work in the coming months. It is intended that the final report of the group will be published as soon as the deliberative process in regard to it has been completed.</P>

      <P>The provision of civil legal aid for the community is arranged by my Department by way of a grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board which is responsible for the 30 law centres around the country. My Department also provides a small grant-in-aid to free legal advice centres, FLAC. My Department does not provide funding for community law centres.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board has agreed to liaise with the group proposing the establishment of a community law centre in Ballymun. The board will also support the work of the community law centre within the scope and terms of the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, by taking appropriate cases referred to it by the community law centre.</P>

I am further informed that the extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. When not open, PACB, Green Man and call diversion sys<Col N="1452" /> tems are in operation and linked to the district headquarters at Naas Garda station. A message is then relayed to the patrol car at Maynooth, which is manned on a 24 hour basis. Resources are augmented from within the district as required.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the allocation of personnel to areas is constantly under review and when personnel next becomes available the needs of Maynooth will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of other areas throughout the country.</P>

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 1106 of 30 January 2001, the reason 966 applications under the 2000 sports capital programme were not successful; the number in each category; the places in relation to the 51 swimming pools mentioned; when each application was received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3232/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 1,645 applications were received by my Department under the 2000 sports capital programme. Of these 679 projects were allocated funding to the value of £36 million while 966 applications were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>Each individual application was assessed according to a detailed set of criteria. These criteria are outlined in section 5 of the guidelines, terms and conditions of the 2001 sports capital programme, a copy of which is attached for the Deputy's information. A scoring system has been developed, under which individual applications are scored between nought and five under each heading depending on the extent to which they met the assessment criteria. Different &lsquo;weights' &ndash; one to four &ndash; are attached to the various criteria depending on their importance. The highest weighting is given to the disadvantaged criteria given that special priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas. At the end of this process each application receives a score which decides its order of priority within its own county.</P>
      <P>The success or failure of each individual application was as a result of its score which decided its order of priority within its own county and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution. Each unsuccessful applicant was issued with a copy of the assessment of their application, which listed the scores achieved under the different criteria and any other comments of my officials in relation to the assessment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the swimming pool programme, the following table sets out the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Extract from Guidelines, Terms and Conditions of the 2001 Sports Capital Programme</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.1All applications will be treated on their merits and highest priority will be afforded <Col N="1478" /> to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. High priority projects will include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, for example, pitch development, floodlighting, dressing rooms-showers. Priority for funding under the programme will not be afforded to works which are not essential or integral to sports participation or performance, for example, landscaping of grounds, boundary fences, equipment stores, car parks.</P>
    <P>5.2 Applicants should note that for the purpose of the programme, disadvantaged areas have been defined as those areas which have been designated by Government under the operational programme for local, urban and rural development.</P>
    <P>5.3Assessment criteria have been developed to help assess applications so that those offering the greatest community benefit are supported. The criteria will focus on:</P>
    <P>the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport, recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, i.e. does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities, possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project, i.e. in addition to lottery funding, has the club/organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe. Previous track record in fund raising is also taken into account; the level of local funding available. Higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able <Col N="1479" /> to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their pro<Col N="1480" /> posals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232, 243, 251, 259 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses (where they reside 3 miles from the centre) and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 people participate annually on the vocational training opportunities scheme at an overall annual cost to the State of £32 million. The vocational training opportunities scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The £15,000 referred to in the questions represents the amount of grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees in respect of each group of 20 students. It covers expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses.</P>
      <P>The VTOS non-pay element of funding of £15,000 per core group of 20 students has remained unchanged since 1989. I am aware that costs generally have increased since then. Because of limitations on resources, it has not so far been found possible to correspondingly increase the grant. However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. An adult educational guidance service has been initiated on a pilot basis, and a new management structure has been developed for the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the Back to Education Initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development <Col N="1484" /> plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

It is not possible to put a time scale on this project until after the stage 2 submission is received. It is intended that the senior school building will be retained for educational purposes, and my officials will submit proposals to me in that regard in due course. In the meantime the building unit has commissioned a report on the works necessary to allow for the effective functioning of the other school building until the amalgamation takes place.

      <P>The centre in question provides adult literacy and basic education programmes, and community employment schemes. Under the vocational training opportunities scheme, my Department provides free tuition and a training allowance in lieu of welfare entitlements to long-term unemployed adults over 21 who are attending full time programmes. VTOS participants who are long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme receive an additional bonus of £25 per week. A limited scheme also operates under which vocational education committees may provide basic education in disadvantaged areas either free or at nominal cost.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Community and Family Affairs also operates a discretionary part-time option scheme under which unemployed people may attend a part-time education course without it affecting their unemployment payment. In all cases, a training allowance paid in the education sector is in lieu of a welfare payment.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, the key priority is to expand access, particularly for those with less than upper secondary education, and to develop a comprehensive range of supporting services. Given the scale of the task, with upwards of 1.1 million adults with less than upper second level education, my priority is to extend free tuition for part-time courses to those who are medical card holders, in receipt of means tested welfare payments or family income supplement and their dependants. It is not envisaged that funds would be available for an additional payment for participants.</P>

      <P>Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.

      <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team.

      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year.

These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

      <P>I understand the student to whom the Deputy refers is attending a part-time undergraduate course at Griffith College which is a private, third level college. Under the higher education grants scheme, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
      <P>An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions. In this regard, Griffith College is not an approved institution for purposes of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges. Any extension to the scope of the main<Col N="1489" /> tenance grants scheme, to include students attending private colleges, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
    <P>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State, including Griffith College, in respect of approved part-time third level courses. The relief applies to part-time undergraduate courses of a minimum duration of two years, both in publicly funded third level institutions and in private colleges. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of September 2000, 29 additional psychologists have been appointed to the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS. They are now being allocated lists of schools. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to assign one of these psychologists to north Kildare. However, a further 21 psychologists are due to be appointed in the next few months from the current panel and it is intended to hold a further competition for recruitment to NEPS later in the year.</P>
      <P>The overall allocation of psychologists to the regions is largely based on the projected student numbers in each school. Each cohort of newly recruited psychologists is being shared among all regions on a pro rata basis, until each region has reached its staffing quota. The management team of NEPS is currently preparing a detailed plan up to the end of 2003, so that schools will know when they are likely to be included in the service.</P>

      <P>Most of my Department's grants to schools are based on the number of pupils enrolled in each school. Because details of enrolments for the current school year are not available for some months after the commencement of the school year, many of the grants tend to be based on enrolments for the previous school year. However, my Department recognises that this is not possible in the case of newly established schools. Therefore, arrangements are made to pay such grants on the basis of their current enrolments. Consequently new schools benefit from such schemes, and grants appropriate to their level of enrolments are paid to each school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service subject to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer. These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further increased in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department. One of the effects of a transfer of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department would be to remove the anomalies that exist at the moment in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from my Department whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants that are issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the discussions that are taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to my Department which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is at present engaged in drawing up detailed proposals for a compensation scheme for survivors of abuse in childhood with a view to submitting detailed proposals to the Government in the near future. I place a very high priority on bringing forward these proposals, which will address all the key issues, including legal representation for claimants.</P>
      <P>The approach of my Department and the Department of Health and Children to the provision of support to survivor support groups is to provide serviced offices rather than direct grants to the groups. A range of services have been in place for some time which provide support for survivors of abuse in the first instance and for groups representing survivors. These include a serviced office in Cork and another in Dublin. Both of these offices offer information in relation to the various Government initiatives for survivors of abuse and public services generally. They also provide, or arrange, for counselling and education services for survivors. Both of the offices provide services for all survivors without reference to their membership of any group.</P>
      <P>In addition to these offices, my Department has been involved with a number of support groups for survivors in establishing a second office in Dublin. While playing a similar role to the other already established offices as far as survivors are concerned, this office will have a more national focus, compared to the more regional focus of the existing offices. This office will be operational within the next week and all survivors and support groups will be eligible to use it.</P>

      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy have been included in the rural dimension of the new programme launched by me last month to address educational disadvantage at primary level. Schools in areas with populations less than 1,500 people were categorised as rural. The census of population for 1996 published by the Central Statistics Office was used for this categorisation.</P>
      <P>The schools in question will receive supplementary grant aid which, in common with other schools being included in the new programme, is based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the extensive survey conducted last year by Educational Research Centre.</P>
      <P>Schools identified by the Educational Research Centre as having the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils will be allocated the services of a co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. The schools referred to by the Deputy have been selected for inclusion in such clusters.</P>
      <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>
      <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be further considered.</P>

      <P>Schools participating in the new pro<Col N="1496" /> gramme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension of the major new programme launched by me last month to address educational disadvantage. It already benefits from inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £3,867 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. In relation to staffing, the school in question has sufficient teaching staff already to implement the maximum class size guidelines of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes set under the new programme in respect of the current school year. The staffing allocation for the 2001-02 school year will be based on the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2000 and will be examined in the context of any changes to the staffing schedule for national schools.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider abolishing fees for post graduate students and increasing their maintenance grants to reflect the level of work carried out by them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the state meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges. There are no plans at present to extend the free fees initiative to postgraduate students.</P>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £887, respectively. A postgraduate grant holder is also eligible to have his or her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
      <P>Last October, I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000-01.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase, annually, third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and to increase the reckon<Col N="1497" /> able income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the state. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
    <P>Postgraduate students are an intrinsic part of the research infrastructure in Ireland. Increasing the number of people with higher degrees is an important national strategic objective. Apart from the general strategic objective of ensuring a vibrant pool of high quality postgraduates, the success of the substantial investment in our research capability is dependant on an adequate supply of high quality graduates.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Government of Ireland Research Scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-01. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will be putting in place, within these fields of study, similar post-graduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes can include the awarding by the colleges of post-graduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The <i>per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to institution and field of study. Some 49 postgraduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the postgraduate research and development skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>

      <P>When I became Minister for Education and Science, I set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. The Deputy will be aware that last month I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and all schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received from the individual school referred to by the Deputy. Naturally, in the absence of a completed survey form relating to the school in question, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage in relation to this school.</P>
      <P>Where an individual school did not participate in the survey, it may make a submission to my Department outlining its circumstances in relation to educational disadvantage. Such submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of the school will then be further considered.</P>

      <P>An application to construct a PE hall at the CBS Secondary School, James Street, Kilkenny, is being reviewed by the staff in the building unit of my Department as the site presents inherent difficulties. Officials from my Department have examined the site and determined that the standard template physical education hall is inappropriate in this case due to the confined nature of the site. There are also aesthetic constraints affecting the building as proposed as it would abut directly onto an old stone wall forming part of historic Kilkenny City. The planning, historical, and archaeological factors affecting the site are being investigated.</P>
      <P>Owing to the uniqueness of the site and the associated constraints, identifying a timeframe for the commencement of construction cannot, at present, be estimated. My Department is, however, making every effort to address the need for a PE hall at the school.</P>
