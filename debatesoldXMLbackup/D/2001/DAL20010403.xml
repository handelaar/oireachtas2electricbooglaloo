      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Steady progress has been made with regard to the objectives for modernisation of the Civil Service, as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The overall aim of the strategic management initiative, the modernisation programme which refers to the Civil Service, is to bring about continuous improvements in service delivery, resource management and organisational responsiveness.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to have copies of the recent progress report of the implementation group of Secretaries General on the SMI laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. In this, its third report to Government, the implementation group outlines the progress made to date, particularly in the context of the agreement in the PPF on a modernisation programme linked to pay increases for the civil and wider public service. The report also signposts the priority actions in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key Civil Service sectoral objectives for the next phase, as set out in the PPF, include deepening the implementation and further refinement of the performance management and development system; further development of the financial management programme; further improvements in customer service standards, including more extensive consultation with and feedback from the users of services; roll-out and implementation of a range of human resource management initiatives; implementation of a programme of regulatory reform; and continued development of information and communication technology systems to support more flexible service delivery and to give effect to electronic government in advanc<Col N="1270" /> ing and supporting information society developments. I am satisfied all these key areas are being progressed effectively and are on schedule to be brought forward over the period of the PPF.</P>
    <P>The implementation group of Secretaries General has developed a template for sectoral performance indicators based on the objectives in respect of the Civil Service, as a sector in its own right. These have been circulated to Departments and offices, which are in the process of developing their own specific performance indicators.</P>
    <P>Payment of the final 4% of the pay increase due under the PPF in October 2002 will depend on specific performance indicators having been developed by Departments and offices and agreed through the partnership process by April 2001 and achieved by April 2002. In accordance with a commitment in the PPF, a quality assurance group has recently been established for the Civil Service to approve the indicators proposed by Departments and offices and to assess the achievement of these performance indicators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is what could be described as a crisis in the Civil Service in that unprecedented numbers of people are leaving the public service, those who are on panels for appointment are not interested when they are finally called to interview and there are many gaps in the Civil Service because posts remain unfilled as a result of the overall improvement in the economy and the failure to modernise many of the management structures on the ground? Does the Taoiseach intend, if he accepts there is a crisis, that the Civil Service Commission and Government Departments will have to change the way in which they recruit people and how they are managed once they enter the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the strategic management initiative, an enormous number of issues have been covered in recent years. It could be argued that it would have been better if much of this activity had taken place over the past 20 years, but it did not. However, the SMI and the quality customer service, regulatory reform, training and modernisation programmes have been up and running since 1994.</P>
      <P>There are clearly difficulties with staffing. The system and old practices used by the Civil Service Commission were slow but they were grand at the time because there were not many vacancies. The former secretary to the Government, Mr. Frank Murray, reformed the commission and enunciated enormous change in it. He was very familiar with the commission because he had been directly involved in it for two decades. Many of the changes are up and running and there is no doubt that the commission is advertising vacancies well in advance and forming panels on an annual basis. These were straightforward, simple changes but they had not been introduced. They are now in place and that is having an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The Deputy is correct that people leaving senior grades in the Civil Service was unheard of for 50 years. Clerical staff left but now more higher ranked staff are leaving and that is creating more vacancies and a greater turn around of staff. The salaries these people can earn in the private sector or even in some sections of the public sector are quite different. One will find more vacancies in every Department. The Civil Service Commission is dealing with this and is ahead of the posse as far as its advertisements and recruitment campaigns are concerned. It does not wait. Instead, it establishes panels. Under the old system the panels were not available; there were only bi-annual runs at the panels. Much of that has been changed, however, so I believe the system will improve.</P>
    <P>From the training perspective, as is clear from my reply and the third report which I have lodged in the Oireachtas Library, people who are recruited to the Civil Service are given more training and have more interest in their jobs. That will benefit the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the PPF not only promises to modernise the Civil Service but contains a commitment to modernise local government. Arising from that and the report published by Kerry County Council yesterday that there was widespread involvement by staff in the preparation of planning applications and in view of the fact that 30 other local authorities are conducting similar investigations, does the Taoiseach agree that modernisation of local government should involve codes of practice&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle: Deputy Noonan, this is well outside the scope of the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is on the modernisation of the Civil Service and my question is on the modernisation of local authorities. They are in the same section of the PPF. Does the Taoiseach believe that the modernisation process should include issuing codes of practice to ensure all local authorities know where they and their officials stand on the issue of part-time work for private citizens where there might be conflicts of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not briefed in this regard and am not familiar with the issue, aside from what I read in the newspapers this morning and heard previously. In general, I agree there should be codes of practice. There are clear guidelines in the Civil Service. There have been for many years and, if I recollect correctly, they were updated when I was Minister for Finance or around that time. They outline what staff can do outside the Civil Service and how they can use their positions. They should apply everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Mini<Col N="1272" /> ster for the Environment and Local Government to ensure that such guidelines are issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the co-ordination of Government policy across the Civil Service and in Departments, what mechanisms has the Taoiseach put in place to achieve that? The Government has asked all public authorities not to meet during the foot and mouth disease crisis, yet the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources refused to move the final date for the receipt of submissions for important foreshore licence applications in Wexford harbour. Is that type of co-ordination part of the remit of this section of the programme for Government and will the Taoiseach ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Government policy that is reflected in practical decisions such as this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas being dealt with include the publication of statements of strategy by every Department and agency and ensuring that people are involved in drafting these statements. The statements have been produced over the past six or seven years. The other areas are the development of business plans within Departments, publication of quality customer service plans, including standards of service delivery, the technology aspect, freedom of information and publishing Departments' annual reports.</P>
      <P>Staff are involved in a more meaningful way than was previously the case in drawing up the objectives of their employment and how they achieve them. It is part of the modernisation of the Civil Service and the strategic management initiative that staff should have more interest in their work. The steps that have been developed over the past seven years have made enormous changes. There are always problems but there have been enormous changes in the value of the job for civil servants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other issue raised by the Deputy, further statements are expected either today or tomorrow from the expert group. Some Departments and agencies are still rigidly following the statement of 1 March even though it has been updated since then by several other statements from the expert group. I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has emphasised this and is in the process of writing to everyone to ask them to go along the lines of what the expert group has said and not just fall back to the statement of 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is anybody co-ordinating this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. All secretaries general are to be written to today. The letters will emphasise that they should be working on the expert group report, not the 1 March guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that any modernisation of the Civil Service should <Col N="1273" /> provide for family-friendly working conditions? To ensure adequate staffing levels are maintained across the Civil Service, does he agree that more attention should be paid by the Government to issues such as flexitime, job sharing and, in particular, adequate crèche facilities for the many couples working in the Civil Service who find it difficult to secure affordable child care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Flexitime and other time-sharing schemes are in place and working well. I thank the Civil Service unions for working with management to develop them. There are child care facilities in some Government agencies, but, clearly, not enough. The budget proposals will be of assistance, in particular the £1 billion increase in investment in these services in the next few years. These provisions which have only been introduced in the Finance Bill are designed to assist those who are working to share family duties and working time in order that they can remain in employment. That is what most of them want. The recent changes in maternity leave will also help significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures to which the Taoiseach referred are not Civil Service-specific. Does he have any specific proposals to ensure civil servants have access to adequate child care facilities in or near their places of work? The Taoiseach, probably, appreciates that this is the one significant issue causing difficulties in Departments maintaining a full complement of professional and competent civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The schemes and enormous resources allocated to this area in the budget are not specific to the Civil Service because that would be unfair. It is far better to allocate resources all over. The improvements in child care facilities in the private sector mean that that sector is now targeting the Civil Service directly; the grant aid and facilities can be used to establish pilot projects with funding from different schemes. It is not perfect, but grants from the equality section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have helped, as have changes in recent Finance Bills which have made it far more attractive to the private sector to allocate capital expenditure to this area as well as other changes which make it easier to avail of accommodation in the sector. It would be nice if, like Revenue, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and other sectors, we could have more in-house facilities, but that is only possible in some Departments. Unfortunately, it is not possible in all Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the strategic management initiative in modernising the Civil Service. Does he agree that it is extraordinary that the committee of the House charged with overseeing the initiative has not been able to meet for the last three to four years because it does not have civil servants available to <Col N="1274" /> it? Does he agree that the process of Civil Service reform should commence in Leinster House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now three or four months since that body moved from being an <i>ad hoc </i>committee on 31 January to being a committee of the House. It also received resources for staff, but it is not for me to discuss the reasons it has not used them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell raises a valid question about why staff have not been hired despite the allocation of resources but it is not for me to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Some 16,000 public servants work in different Government offices all within a mile of the House. They must commute to work, many of them by car and take up office space. Given that electronic commerce can be transacted across the globe, does the Taoiseach consider there may be merit in allowing some public servants to work from home by feeding into central computer systems in their office headquarters? Such a system would be efficient and family compatible. Does the Taoiseach also accept that within the Civil Service and the semi-State sector people tend to be paid for hours worked rather than work done and does he agree that an evaluation of the practicality of my suggestion is warranted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some elements of the private sector have implemented systems similar to that suggested by the Deputy. Some very successful private sector companies only require their employees to attend head offices for meetings. I am not sure how it would work in the public sector. It has not yet been raised as an issue. At present public servants, especially younger ones, would prefer to work nearer home through decentralisation. That is on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than the marginal changes happening in the Civil Service Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Frank Murray, will the Taoiseach indicate if it is the case that the Government does not intend to take any initiatives to fill the widespread and unprecedented staff vacancies, not only in the Oireachtas but across Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is with the SMI process in the Civil Service. In the local authorities and health areas, which are the responsibility of other Ministers, all kinds of schemes are in place, including the FÁS programme for staff recruitment from many countries. I understand FÁS is currently in Russia for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to have Russian civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the Civil Service but in different parts of the public service. All Civil Service staff are recruited and employed by the Civil Service Commission. It is the only vehicle through which the system can be changed. The <Col N="1275" /> modernisation of the Civil Service, the SMI and all other activities are designed to change the old regulations to ensure that panels are created at greater speed and that staff are better trained. This will help to ensure a better allocation of staff to posts. Most of the ideas taken from the private sector are being applied. In this regard Mr. Michael Quinn, managing director of ICC Bank, is chairing the quality assurance group, which includes many individuals from outside the Civil Service. It is considering any other improvements and where identified they have been implemented. It will continue to make a significant difference.</P>

      <P>The perception is that the programme of decentralisation has been shelved. Will the Taoiseach indicate what is meant by it being on the agenda?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Government's decision of May 2000, Departments submitted preliminary strategy statements for the electronic delivery of public services for which they are responsible. Following consideration of these, my Department has embarked on the next phase which involves using external facilitators to work with Departments in refining and prioritising their departmental strategies. The objective is to produce a composite strategy by the summer for the delivery, in the next 12 to 18 months, of public services electronically. At the same time, the Reach Agency is looking at how delivery of these services can be integrated. On completion of the composite strategy it is my intention to have it published as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any information on provision for the electronic processing of planning applications? Does he accept that, because of a combination of substantial increases in the volume of applications in the past number of years and a crisis in staffing levels, the public is being poorly served by the current system, particularly those who want to see what is actually being proposed, and that one way to modern<Col N="1276" /> ise the system would be to conduct the entire planning application process electronically?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it does not form part of the remit of my Department, that is one of the issues being considered. Two more phases of the Revenue on-line process will be initiated this year encompassing the motor tax and planning applications areas. Those three areas are being looked at. I would be misleading the Deputy if I said that it was being done everywhere, but it is, certainly, being done in a number of local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure and public-private partnerships has met 13 times since January 2000. It will continue to meet monthly throughout 2001.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure and PPPs is an integral part of Government and, as with any Cabinet committee, its meetings are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>A great deal of work is being done on all aspects of the infrastructure agenda. Questions on particular aspects should be tabled to the relevant Minister.</P>

For example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has lost £40 million, of which some £20 million was for housing and £15 million for water and sewerage provision. The schools and hospital buildings budget has lost £45 million, as a consequence of which it will, certainly, run behind schedule.

      <P>The Government remains fully committed to the delivery of the NDP infrastructural programme within the timescale of the programme, which is 2007. Expenditure on the infrastructural programme this year will represent an increase of almost 30% over the out-turn for last <Col N="1279" /> year. Deputy McDowell's point is that expenditure in the first year of the programme was about 95% of the target set.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's point is that the post-budget revisions on the public capital programme will have a marginal impact on overall NDP capital spending on the infrastructural programme, which covers the issues the Deputy raised, namely, roads, public transport, health, housing and child care. It amounts to 3.5% of the total expenditure allocation. Last year expenditure was about 95% of the target set. In terms of that 3.5%, there were capacity issues involved, but they will not create a difficulty in 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan was published in 1999 and I presume the costs of infrastrutural works are in 1999 prices. Given that inflation in construction projects is running at approximately 15%, has the plan been revised? How has the capacity of the construction industry to deliver the national development plan and planning, environmental impact statements etc. impacted on the progress of the plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said here previously, the Government has been concerned with the level of capacity in the construction industry. The level of tender price inflation is a little lower than what the Deputy said. It is 12.5%. It is not sustainable at that level, as it would eat into the programme. The Deputy is correct in that analysis.</P>
      <P>We established a high level group under the Department of the Environment and Local Government and an action plan will be published shortly by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to deal specifically with these issues. In the meantime a number of actions have taken place, one of which included actively encouraging foreign contractors to tender for projects under the NDP. We discussed these a number of times last year, but what has been happening since the beginning of the year is encouraging. Quite a number of competitive tenders from foreign companies have come in. A large number of contractors have registered their interest in bidding for large road and rail projects under the NDP. There are a number of large ones in terms of PPPs for the next period. There is the PPP aspect to the Limerick by-pass, the Kilcock-Kinnegad road and Waterford bridge and road. In all of those there is significant interest by the contractors. The Kildare by-pass is due to start one of these days, if it has not already started, and there is also the south-eastern motorway and the port tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these have significant contractors or sub-contractors from abroad. The second point is the recruitment of key building professionals and town planners from abroad. The FÁS jobs <Col N="1280" /> Ireland campaign has proved very effective in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question about the remit of the committee following the Taoiseach's reply where he listed a number of largescale road projects. Is it correct to assume the committee will follow European standards in relation to infrastructure works? I have raised this issue with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to the National Roads Authority. Will the committee insist that EN1317, a European standard, is applied to the national development plan so that crash barriers are installed on the roads on which people drive at speed? Should that standard be applied rather than the National Roads Authority standard which is an old 1960's British standard? Will the Taoiseach ensure the committee brings its remit and authority to bear on that matter so that money is not misspent and European funding jeopardised by the fact that the standard applied is not the highest European standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the remarks made by the Taoiseach on the capacity problem shortly after the setting up of the Cabinet sub-committee, is he satisfied the average length of the national road construction projects is a mere seven kilometres and does he feel that is sufficient? That clearly does not attract the large construction firms from abroad with their resources, equipment and labour to release Irish capacity. They come as financial partners but they do not bring the extra resources we need. There is a need to release&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that. The <Col N="1281" /> national roads programme is progressing well but we are worried by what is eaten away by inflation. The Deputy mentioned the average length of road projects and is correct in saying they do not attract contractors, but following the changes in planning legislation the situation will be more attractive for all major roads. The Waterford road will now involve just two contracts and will be tendered as such. The same will hopefully go for the five routes so they will create interest among foreign contractors. It is the intention of the National Roads Authority that the length and distance on the five major road structures will be of a significant length to attract the interest of the international market. They now have the power under the Planning and Development Act to cross county and local authority boundaries so they will be able to seek tenders for substantive stretches of road.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that a key component of the national development plan is regional development, a fundamental pillar of which is the choice of growth centres to act as engines for economic growth in the regions outside Dublin. A grave deficiency on the part of the committee, on the part of the Taoiseach and on the part of the Government has been the refusal by the Government to choose appropriate growth centres in the regions. When will the sub-committee consider this matter, or will it ever do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would find it useful to table a question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as he could provide the information. The group within the Department of the Environment and Local Government working on this hopes to have its work completed by the end of the year. It has the work well advanced and it has also discussed it with many other organisations and agencies as part of the spatial report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from some of the magazines in the professional world of architects, engineers and surveyors that they have already worked out some of the areas, so it is not a secret as to where some of these centres will be. The group is trying to adopt a holistic approach to regional development. The process, which has continued for a year or two, is very detailed and it is hoped the work <Col N="1282" /> will be fully completed this year. Much of the interim work has already been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act ensures the planners and the NRA do not have to stick to the previous rigidities under which they could plan and design schemes only within local authority and county boundaries. They can now work on equal stretches on the five major roads &ndash; Dublin-Waterford, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Belfast and Dublin-Galway. This has allowed them to bring in one project team, one planning team and to assemble the CPO structures and all necessary arrangements in one sequence. This will quicken the process from design, to planning, to CPO and, hopefully, to construction. This is how the Act has improved things.</P>

        <b>:</b> Given that some of the key elements in the plan, for example, the Luas project and the port tunnel, are way over budget and time, and given that commentators reckon that between 55% and 60% of the national development plan will be achieved within the timescale set out, is the Taoiseach satisfied the Cabinet committee and the various sub-committees have the necessary capacity to manage the infrastructural section of the plan? Does he agree that what is needed is a more dynamic new institution working directly to his Department and which would work within a specific timescale and strictly within budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to work within budget and within the NDP and the Community Support Framework. A discussion document will shortly be issued on co-operation and co-ordination among the eastern regional groups, namely, the local authorities in Dublin and surrounding areas. The national roads programme is well ahead of schedule; the QBC network and additional buses are in place and nine of the 11 bus corridors will be in place by the end of the month; Luas is on schedule for two years' time and work on the design for the metro is under way, though it will take a long time.</P>
      <P>The legal reforms provided for in the Planning and Development Act are being or, as Deputy Gilmore said, will be implemented shortly. The proposals for a radical reform of public transport structures have been published while good progress is being made on the PPP programme in respect of which monitoring arrangements have been established for detailed project tracking. There is also development of the communications strategy under the NDP. The committee, which I chair, is doing very good work. The civil servants, the NRA and other groups help to make it one of the most effective of all the Cabinet committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider putting some mechanisms in place in order that the Dáil will be regularly informed when allocations to Departments for capital spending are not being spent? For example, for the past two years, a very big allocation has been given to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the provision of child care facilities. While they were announced with great élanand publicity, they have not been spent. Last year, out of a total of £60 million, about £120,000 was spent. I have asked the Taoiseach if he will put a procedure in place in order that the Dáil will be regularly informed when Departments are not doing the job the Government has asked them to do, that is, to spend capital moneys in a way the public requires. Certainly, there is no more pressing issue facing young people than the issue of child care.</P>

He may not be as impressed if he had to travel by rail. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a trend which witnesses a quicker roll-out of road projects due to the efficiency of the National Roads Authority and the fact that engineers are likely to be snapped up for road projects that can be contracted out more easily? Does he agree that there is a difficulty in acquiring engineering expertise and staff for the rail infrastructural aspects of the national development plan? Will he ensure there will be more balance at committee level given that there is no body equivalent to the NRA for railway infrastructure on which more emphasis needs to be placed if the gridlock and bottlenecks are to be relieved?</P>

      <P>On the question of incentives for foreign workers, if the contracts are big enough they are definitely interested, although they must also comply with trade union regulations. They will not be interested in small projects, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out. When the value goes over a certain figure such as £60 million to £70 million they will be interested, whereas a smaller contract valued at perhaps £30 million to £40 million would not have the same attraction.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies might expect, any attempt to predict the impact of foot and mouth disease on the economic and budgetary outlook is highly conjectural. This is because the future development of the disease is itself unpredictable. If there was a significant outbreak, the main effects would be losses due to the culling of animals, losses due to restrictions on sales in export markets and losses to the tourism sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main sectors at risk are primary agriculture and the agri-business and tourism sectors. Obviously, if the outbreak remains relatively limited in extent and duration then the economic and <Col N="1285" /> budgetary impact would not be very significant. However, if foot and mouth disease were to spread to reach the level currently experienced in the United Kingdom, it would have significant economic and budgetary implications. Commentators have estimated that, in the event of a serious outbreak, economic growth could fall by up to 1.5% this year. I would not disagree with these estimates as reasonable orders of magnitude. If the impact was of this order the budgetary outlook would also be affected.</P>
    <P>This Government is making every effort to minimise the risk of the disease spreading. I take this opportunity to thank the public for their co-operation in this national effort and to ask them for their continued patience in our campaign to keep foot and mouth disease from spreading any further.</P>

      <P>It is not our practice to review the estimates for growth except in the mid-year review. This was the tradition long before I became Minister for Finance and it is one to which I could adhere. There is an economic review published in July each year which takes into account factors such as foot and mouth disease. When the budget arrives I issue the new forecast for the coming year. The next time the situation will be reviewed is in the economic review and outlook. I am taking on board what outside commentators have said in this regard and I do not necessarily disagree with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been good enough to indicate that he does not disagree with other commentators. He will be aware that the Central Bank calculated last year that in the event of a recession in the United States we could expect a reduction in growth in the region of 2%-3% this year. By adding the two factors of foot and mouth disease and recession in the US together, would it be unreasonable to speculate that growth this year will end up between 3% and 5% less than that projected on budget day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions relate to the impact of the foot and mouth disease on the economic forecasts for this year and it is on that subject that I am replying. In the mid-year review all factors will be taken into account such as the condition of the world economy. It has been good practice that the Government of the day does not re-jig forecasts every month. However, the views of outside commentators including the Central Bank and independent commentators are taken on board. Therefore, there is a fair idea of the likely impact of these factors. The question here relates to the impact of the foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>Every month the figures are published for expenditure and for tax returns. Each quarter the quarterly figures are released. The impact of foot and mouth disease should be quite limited for the first quarter but there has undoubtedly been a decline in economic activity in some corners of the country over the past five to six weeks. If the outbreak of foot and mouth disease was to be severe some commentators have estimated a worst case scenario of a drop of 1%-1.5% in GNP.</P>

Long before I became Minister for Finance the officials of the Department of Finance have given the exchequer returns at 4.30 p.m. on a day soon after the end of the financial quarter. I do not have a role in this except to issue a press release containing a brief comment on the figures. Questions can be asked at the press conference.

      <P>The Minister should agree that the major impact of foot and mouth disease, aside from on the agricultural sector, is likely to be on the tourism sector.

Is the Minister considering measures of this kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Private Members' time tonight will deal with the impact of foot and mouth disease on the tourism industry. Tourism represents about 5% of GDP and about 9% of employment or 150,000 persons. The impact of the tourism sector on the general economy is that of a major employer and a major catalyst for recent economic growth. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is well in control of the matter.</P>

      <P>I want to join in protest with Deputy McDowell. The Minister will not answer questions in this House which will be answered by civil servants outside. I do not believe the markets will be rocked if the Minister tells the House there is a slight downturn in economic growth, or in receipts. It is not good enough for the Minister to do what he is doing and it should not be allowed by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to estimate what impact it will have on the retail sector but there are a number of sectors which are affected, and I referred to them in my reply. It depends on the duration of a severe outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Some independent commentators have speculated that a severe outbreak would have an effect on GNP of up to 1%. Others have given higher figures. That depends on the extent and duration of a severe outbreak and we have not had a severe outbreak yet. What we have is an outbreak contained in one part of the country and I hope that will remain the situation. We have taken severe precautions in past weeks and these have paid off. There would be an impact on GNP if a serious outbreak occurred. The Deputy's questions relate to the foot and mouth outbreak. The Exchequer returns are published at this time every quarter and these questions have no bearing on the Exchequer returns which will be published at 4.30 this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal functions of the National Pensions Fund Commission is to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. The commission is independent of the Government in the exercise of this and its other functions. My main aim in making appointments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission was to select persons of the necessary stature and calibre to manage the fund and who would be seen to be independent of Government in the performance of their functions.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act requires that as far as practicable, the Minister for Finance shall ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the commission. However, in appointing the commission I also had to have regard to the provisions of the Act which require commissioners to have acquired substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in areas such as accountancy, finance or economics, law or any of the other areas set out in section 7(4) of the Act. In choosing the commissioners I have tried to take account of both these objectives.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, section 7(4) of the Act sets out areas from which commissioners may be chosen. Trade union representation is one of these areas. The purpose of the subsection is to ensure only persons who have certain expertise and experience may be appointed to the fund. However, the commission is an expert rather than a representative body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McDowell: Is the Minister aware that in a recent survey it was shown that his Department is second only to the Department of Defence in the paucity of women it appoints to State boards? A figure of 20% applies, rather than the Government target of 40%. Does he wish to confirm, repeat or deny the comments attributed to him in the press last month that he found it difficult to find women who did this sort of complicated work? Is he seriously suggesting that it was only possible to find one woman who met the criteria he has just described?</P>

      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage I set out, in section 7(4), the areas from which members of the commission should be appointed. The Act is the only one I am aware of which includes a subsection setting out the required expertise of appointees to a commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell refers to the fact that no trade union representative was appointed.  It was never the intention that people would be appointed to the commission as representatives of a particular sector. Appointees were required to have substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in a number of areas which are specified in section 7(4). These include trade union representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>When making appointments to a board I do not begin by wondering where I will find a number of men and a number of women. I try to appoint the best people. If the best people for a seven person board were all women I would appoint them. The same would apply if the best people were all men. That is what I tried to do in this case. In preparing the Bill and during its passage through the Oireachtas, I made it clear that I intended to appoint people to the board who were of considerable stature and who would be recognised as people of substance and experience in their fields. That is what I have endeavoured to do. The choice was mine and it was then approved by the Government.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McDowell: What the Minister has said is not in keeping with Government policy. The programme for Government clearly identifies a target of 40% women appointees to State boards. The Minister has just made a nonsense of that target and has made it clear he does not support it.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was some discussion about trade union representation. It was my understanding and the expectation of the trade union movement that the Minister would consider the appointment of a trade unionist to the commission. Did the Minister consider that and if so, why did he reject it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered it and did something about it. One of the appointees, Ms Brid Horan, is a former senior official with what is now called the MSF and was chairperson of the ICTU women's committee. She was senior delegate to ICTU conferences on a regular basis. She is consulted by numerous unions and the ICTU on pension matters and has tutored on training courses <Col N="1290" /> for pension trustees. Deputy McDowell should know that Ms Horan has considerable expertise in trade union affairs.</P>
      <P>The answer to Deputy McDowell's question is, yes. I gave due consideration to the matter. Ms Horan would probably have been appointed in any event. She has considerable experience as an actuary and has a role in relation to the ESB pension fund. She has considerable experience of trade union affairs. If the Deputy does not know her, he certainly knows her husband, whose name is not Horan.</P>

    <P>The estimated public service pay expenditure for the year 2001 is £7,964 million which represents an increase of 17.2% over year 2000. The estimated consumer price index figure for 2001 is 4.5%</P>
    <P>The comparison of the increase in the pay and pensions bill with the rate of increase in the CPI is, however, misleading. The pay and pensions bill increases because of a number of factors, not just pay rate increases. For example, developments in services which include any increase in the numbers employed will have an impact. The pay bill as a percentage of net current non-capital supply spending has remained between 49% and 51% in <Col N="1291" /> the period. As a percentage of GDP it has declined from 10.3% in 1996 to 7.9% in 2000.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the question of pay is fundamental to the continuation of economic growth? Does he accept that in his time as Minister average growth has been almost 10% per annum? He will be also aware of the pressure for further pay increases, not just among teacher. What is his policy on pay now and what further growth in pay is expected in the next year or two?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept most of the points made by the Deputy. I accept it is an important issue in moving forward. The increase in net current spending in recent years is primarily as a result of the increased pay bill. For the sake of fairness to everybody, it is not just pay &ndash; it is a combination of increased pay and numbers. Therefore, the average increase in pay must be about 10% for the years I have been in charge but the numbers have increased considerably. The partnership agreements set out pay increases. The numbers employed in a number of areas have been increased. For example, in the major departments, the health sector accounts for 37% of the total pay bill and has shown the greatest increase in the period, the education sector accounts for about 30%, the security sector accounts for about 14% and the Civil Service accounts for about 15%. Therefore, health and education account for 67% of the total pay and pensions bill. When we increase money for the health area, in particular, it is not just an increase in pay there is also an increase in the number of persons. I can get the figures for the extra numbers employed in the health service since 1997. They are considerable. Therefore, the pay and pensions bill increases as a result of increased numbers and pay. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, in going forward we have agreed to the benchmarking process and will report by June 2002. Already we have agreed in the renegotiated PPF that 25% of any increase granted will be backdated to 1 December 2001. The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that it is a major burden on current expenditure. However, this is the result of a growing economy and increased numbers and increased pay which is negotiated freely by the Government and the other partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into office I established that there was a clear need for additional space to address the unsatisfactory office accommodation within the Leinster House complex.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study showed that it was possible to develop a building of approximately 8,500 square metres on this site for a budget of £25 million.</P>
      <P>The brief, which evolved following further in depth and lengthy assessment of the requirements of Members and staff, determined that the Office of Public Works should develop a building that would be highly flexible in nature to maximise its use now and in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering committee was established to oversee the development, chaired by me and comprising of members of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, Oireachtas management, Office of Public Works officials and officials of the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach. The committee held its inaugural meeting on 23 <Col N="1293" /> November 1997 and further meetings were held on 2 April 1998, 17 June 1998, 8 October 1998, 29 April 1999 and 2 February 2000. At each of these meetings the members were apprised of all issues in relation to this development, that is planning, design, lay outs and building progress. Numerous meetings at a working level involving members of the steering committee and Office of Public Works officials took place at all phases of the development. There were also numerous meetings with the party Whips and party administrators and staff representatives on room allocations, office layouts and other matters. Full and wide-ranging consultative discussions took place throughout the entire development with all users of these offices.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall consultative process a sample prototype office was constructed on site and shown to members of the steering committee. The office was also widely viewed by other Oireachtas Members and staff and any observations made, for example, suggestions on furniture configuration, storage facilities, lighting, decoration, etc., were taken on board in refining the design for the final office layout.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the building works, the Office of Public Works has continued to provide a help line and personalised service to Members and staff in relation to the new offices and has dealt with the many additional items that Members and staff have requested, that is additional furniture, shelving, notice boards, and individual customising of offices. Information notices advising Members and staff on any outstanding issues and the time frames for dealing with these issues were issued by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>A customer satisfaction survey on the overall facilities in Leinster House is currently being conducted. This is evidence of my commitment to consultation with Members and staff in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>It should also be recognised that all existing office accommodation in the '32 Annex, five storey building and engineering block was fully upgraded for Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to a comparable standard to the new annex building during the summer recess 2000. This accommodation was fully refurbished with new heating systems, redecoration, furniture etc. The speed with which this work was undertaken and the quality of workmanship in the refurbishment has attracted much praise. This work and the construction of the new annex building were achieved with minimal disruption to the working arrangements of the Oireachtas, and to those of Members and their staff. The Office of Public Works is to be particularly commended in this regard.</P>
    <P>It was originally intended that staff of the Oireachtas would also be accommodated in the new Leinster House annex building, which comprises 8,500 square metres of office space <Col N="1294" /> approximately. However, it was decided that all this space would be allocated to Oireachtas Members and staff to maximise the facilities available to them. The staff of the Oireachtas will now be accommodated in Kildare House, as will the Oireachtas crèche and fitness room. Refurbishment work on Kildare House is in planning and will be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>This major project was completed within the budget of £25 million. I am satisfied that, notwithstanding certain industrial relations difficulties experienced by the main contractor which were outside the control of the Office of Public Works, the new building was delivered at the earliest possible date. I am satisfied there was an appropriate level of consultation by the Office of Public Works conducted with Members and their staff at all stages of the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in the committee rooms there are no ancillary rooms, no waiting rooms for those appearing before a committee? Two inquiries are due to take place shortly. There are no rooms where people can meet with their expert advisers. Is he aware that the shape and size of rooms used by Members are unsatisfactory in many cases? Many people are experiencing difficulty in operating in the rooms. The air conditioning in Members' rooms is not working properly or is inadequate and if one opens the windows things blow all over the place. The matter needs to be sorted out. It comes back to the fact that consultation with Members ceased when the building was coming near completion. I understand that more than 12 months elapsed before the completion of the building when there were no committee meetings to discuss the nitty gritty of the offices, the actual layout and so on. That should have been the crucial period when Members' input would have been important. Is it not because of the lack of consultation with Members that the difficulties arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee rooms operating in Leinster House are probably the most modern that exist in any parliament in Europe. The only comparable committee rooms in existence are probably in the new Reichstag in Berlin. That has been said not by me but by others who observed the building. What Members do not realise is that the committee rooms are specifically designed as almost modern television studios, which is what emanated from many Members in the context of what the future will hold for the broadcast of committees. The design is incredibly technical. The facilities and all the digital equipment is there, something which is not available in many other parliaments. The circulation space for committee rooms in the ground area was designed, as in other parliaments, as holding areas for people to circulate before going into committee rooms. There are attaching to all the committee rooms small interview rooms which were not designed to be large meeting rooms. That is not their purpose. <Col N="1295" /> They were designed for a Minister or a member of a committee to meet a person on a one to one basis. The circulation area is a fabulous area which has access to all the committee rooms.</P>
      <P>I reject what the Deputy has said with regard to the consultation process. I spent days, nights and weekends consulting Members. The difficulty is that all 166 members of the Dáil and all 60 members of the Seanad became architects and everybody wanted something different. I had to make an assessment in conjunction with all the Members and I think we have got it right. I assure the House that the design and size of the offices in the new building are ahead of even the new parliamentary designs in Westminster and in the Reichstag in Germany. As in any new building a certain amount of teething problems have to be eliminated. That building is the same size as Hawkins House. It was a remarkable architectural and engineering achievement to put into that space such a modern facility.  That is the view of the majority of Members who wrote to me on the issue.</P>

      <P>There is one small meeting room adjacent to the committee rooms which is unsuitable if witnesses from different backgrounds are being called who may be hostile to each other. I have seen the offices in Westminster and they are superior to facilities here. The room allocated to Fine Gael is underground and there is no natural light. The room is unsuitable for a large party such as Fine Gael where meetings can go on for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the introduction of a new programme of decentralisation in the next couple of months. It is unfortunate that I have not been able to progress the issue as quickly as I would have liked, but the reality is that I have been heavily involved in a range of very important activities in recent months, most recently with the Finance Bill which was only enacted in recent days and the revised Estimates which were published only last week. I now intend to pursue, with some vigour, my plans for a new programme of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of preparatory work has been done in my Department in the past year or so in developing proposals which I intend to finalise for submission to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation and thereafter the Government. In finalising my proposals I will have regard to all the submissions received by my Department. I will also take into account a number of other factors and views, including those of Civil Service management and the civil and public service unions. I have also in recent months been having informal discussions with my Government colleagues with regard to a new programme.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to sound evasive about a final date for a decision, I cannot say definitively when a final Government decision will be taken. The scale of the proposed programme and the range of issues and views which need to be taken into account are such that a reasonable period of consideration is appropriate. It is my firm intention, however, to progress my proposals expeditiously and I assure the House of my determination and that of the Government to decide on a substantial programme of decentralisation in the next couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister joking or serious when he says that he intends to make a announcement on the issue in a couple of months? On 26 October 2000 he said that it was his intention to make a decision on a new programme of decentralisation by the end of the year, but nothing has happened. What is the reason for the delay? Is it because of the traditional Fianna Fáil habit of surfacing when an election is in sight or because politics and not the national interest will be the criterion? Bandon Chamber of Commerce and I made an outstanding case for the town. What are we to say to the people concerned? Is it like &ldquo;Waiting for <Col N="1297" /> Godot&rdquo;? Is there a genuine intention to proceed with the programme and, if so, when? Why has this not happened already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been great interest in decentralisation with over 120 submissions received from various towns. We have been discussing such weighty matters as the impact of foot and mouth disease, but more Deputies are in the House for this reply. This indicates that the issue of considerable importance to them. I would have liked to proceed with the issue more speedily, but there are many competing interests. The submissions have to be evaluated. No area is excluded or included. The Civil Service unions wished to be consulted. We initiated such a process which had limited success, but negotiations broke off. Civil Service management also had to be consulted which involved a high level committee of senior civil servants. All this work has been ongoing. I have received representations from Members on all sides and the easiest option would be to do nothing. There is a high level of interest among individual civil servants who wish to be decentralised, but this fact is not always reflected by their trade unions. All these issues will be taken into account. I hope to bring the matter to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the nature of the group evaluating the submissions? Is it comprised entirely of officials from the Department? If so, who are they and what criteria are they using? Will the Minister confirm that the reason no decision has been made is the unfavourable political response to his initial decision to scatter decentralisation among clusters of towns among which a Department would be divided? The Minister was afraid of the fallout from this response. An excellent case has been made for Mullingar which has never benefited from decentralisation. Is the Minister prepared to give such towns priority in any future programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The group in my Department has evaluated all submissions. My officials and I also held negotiations with secretaries general and Ministers from other Departments. I held meetings with all my ministerial colleagues. No one set of criteria is being used and no town is included or excluded because it benefited from decentralisation in the past. The idea of clusters has been around for some time, but that is not the reason for my not making a decision. I will take into account towns which never benefited from decentralisation, but there are as many opinions on the issue as there are Deputies. Over 100 towns have made representations, all of which cannot be accommodated. I accept that there are political difficulties. I am not suggesting that Wexford is not a suitable location, but Deputies Yates and Howlin were Ministers when sections of their Departments were decentralised to Wexford. I will not approach the issue on that basis. I would abandon the process entirely if I <Col N="1298" /> thought that was how it would be handled. The Cabinet sub-committee comprises the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Environment and Local Government and me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is, at least in theory, working on a national spatial plan. However, the decentralisation programme and the national spatial plan are rarely mentioned together. I do not wish to be glib, but do the two relate and is there the necessary level of co-ordination between them? I understood the decision had been taken to decentralise the Land Registry to Waterford.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that there was not an announcement as to any location for any office. I understand from reading the local newspapers that there were announcements in that county but they were not made by my colleague, the Minister of State. The national spatial strategy is being prepared by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and that is one of the reasons for having him on the subcommittee. If we are to have an announcement on decentralisation, we will have it before the national spatial strategy is published, otherwise we will be waiting for a longer period of time. I hope to get this matter out of the way in the coming months, notwithstanding the obvious political difficulties. However, to give people like Deputy McDowell adequate time to prepare for the next election, we would like to have it out of the way as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the positive response from the Minister and urge him to expedite this matter. The Minister will be well aware of the case we, in Kilrush, have made and of the unique initiative that has been taken by Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush in forming a joint approach with a view to getting perhaps some public service offices between the three towns. This is a very enthusiastic response from the three towns and, as the Minister is well aware, it also covers three constituencies &ndash; West Limerick, North Kerry and Clare. It is a compact arrangement and one <Col N="1299" /> which I am sure the Minister will look at very carefully before he makes a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy looking for extra seats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe to recover some seats. I am aware of the submission made by the three areas &ndash; Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel. As Deputy Daly is already aware, during a visit to the Kilrush area in the past year, the people of Kilrush availed of the opportunity to present me with a very fine presentation on video. They made a very good case for their location but so have many other communities, groups and chambers of commerce and political representatives. The difficulty is that everybody thinks their location is the favourite one.</P>
      <P>The management group in the Civil Service, the higher civil servants, make the point that we have to have effective management post-decentralisation and that must be taken into account as well. I am not as given to some of the cases made by people in that regard because with developments in technology in recent years, one can do a very effective job in places with which one could never have dealt before, supervise and have an efficient organisation as good as one ever had.</P>
      <P>The best co-operation in this round has been from Departments that have experienced decentralisation and do not fear it. It is interesting to note that they are the most progressive Departments because they have done it before and have seen that the world does not end and they are not afraid of it, whereas Departments which have not been over this course keep putting up obstacles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to look up the definition of &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; before I came in because Leitrim is the only county in which there has not been any decentralisation. I was at a meeting of the finance committee last May attended by the Minister and we discussed this issue. He suggested that the Government would implement a decentralisation plan very shortly after that and that there would be ten locations throughout the country. Will there still be ten locations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to disagree with the Minister but at the finance committee meeting last May, he said there would be ten locations throughout the country, that he would support the idea of clustering Departments in regions and that he found the greatest difficulty at that stage to be getting the civil servants to move to the regions. Does he still believe there will be ten locations and in clustering Departments in regions? Are there still difficulties trying to get civil servants to move to these areas? Will the Minister give favourable consideration to Carrick-on-Shannon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have not made decisions as to the locations of the bodies moving, the latter part of the question relating to civil servants does not arise. From meeting civil servants and from the individual representations they make to politicians, it appears that a considerable number want to move to other parts of the country about which I think their managers in the Departments and maybe the trade union representatives would be surprised.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have misled Deputy Reynolds. I would have said to the finance committee that the possibility of clustering was an approach to decentralisation which gives efficiency. Clustering does not have to mean that Departments would have to locate five miles apart. Going 25 miles in Leitrim is like going four miles in Dublin or in the towns near Dublin. I will give consideration to County Leitrim, although it has not done too badly because the rural renewal scheme covers all of Country Leitrim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the criteria and to come back to what Deputy McDowell said on the spatial plan versus decentralisation, will towns targeted in the spatial plan get decentralisation? That will urbanise parts of the country rather than fulfil the objective of decentralisation. Will the Minister elaborate on that? On the CPSU and difficulties in regard to discussions with civil servants, thousands of civil servants have requested to transfer out of Dublin into the regions. Has the Minister considered using information technology to allow civil servants to work from home or from rural areas as of now until the decentralisation is in place? When will we see the decentralisation to Roscommon town of the General Register Office which was announced in the early 1990s and has yet to be completed? Does he agree that Roscommon would be an ideal town for clustering in that a couple of thousand civil servants have already requested transfers to towns surrounding County Roscommon? When does the Minister hope to see this decentralisation happen? He said the announcement would be in a couple of months, but when will we see movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This will not be judged on one criterion. A call will have to be made about the locations to which decentralisation will take place. That will set off a round of indignation if places that made representations do not get it. If we are serious about doing it, we have to make a call some time or another and get on with it. As I said in reply to an earlier question, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is on the Cabinet sub-committee. If we are to have decentralisation this year, it will not coincide with <Col N="1301" /> the national spatial strategy because that will take considerably more time.</P>
      <P>Some ideas are being considered by my Department as regards more attractive work methods for civil servants. I assume they are considering ways of trying to encourage people to work from home. They are always looking at new ideas. I was aware that the General Register Office was to be moved to Roscommon many years ago and was of the belief that part of it had moved.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the cluster idea because we have the model with Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh. I fully support what Deputy Daly said earlier in regard to Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel. It would mean a great deal to the economies of the three towns to get decentralisation. As the Minister is probably aware, if one is outside the BMW area in which there are enhanced incentives, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract industries to locations such as Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel. I would like such factors to be taken into consideration because it would mean a great deal to those three constituencies which are outside the BMW area.</P>

      <Quest>the progress which has been made by the Revenue Commissioners' investigation into the tax affairs of 120 individuals linked to the Ansbacher deposits; when it is expected that the investigation will be completed; the total amount in payments secured as a result of the investigation; the average amount paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this question was dealt with on 20 February 2001. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the position is largely unchanged. The work of the special team established to investigate the tax affairs of those named in the report of the authorised officer on the examination of the books and documents of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited is ongoing. As I indicated previously, the Revenue has informed me that this work entails examining the tax affairs not only of the individuals but of associated entities, including companies and trusts going as far back as the 1970s. Conse<Col N="1302" /> quently, the work is complex, time consuming and detailed. It is expected that the investigations will continue for some time and I understand it is impossible to indicate at this stage when the operation will be completed.</P>
      <P>The Revenue has secured information from some of the named persons and has successfully obtained court orders against financial institutions to supply information in addition to the report of the authorised officer. To date, almost 65,000 documents have been received from various parties involved. This documentation is being controlled and interrogated using computer software. Available Revenue powers will continue to be used as appropriate to secure further information. To date, payments averaging £217,000 per case have been received from 29 cases on the list while a further seven cases with offshore investment or deposits have paid an average of £185,000 per case. Thus, the total amount collected to date is £7.6 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are similar to those the Minister gave me on 20 February. Since then there have been press reports that Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited or a bank associated with it in the Cayman Islands is willing to co-operate with the Revenue. I presume the Minister has read these reports. I understand this is being challenged by some Irish individuals or trusts in the courts in the Cayman Islands. Will the Minister indicate whether the Revenue is pursuing that matter and whether it intends to be represented in the Cayman Islands if such matters go to court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Revenue is not involved in the approach of the court in the Cayman Islands. That is not a Revenue matter and any such approach would be a matter for the High Court inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate this is a matter for the courts but, as I understood it from the press reports, the Cayman Islands' bank indicated it was willing to make available information which would be of interest to the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the information that has come to light in this regard has arisen from various reports and is of considerable interest to the Revenue but the approach of the court in the Cayman Islands is a matter for the inspectorate, not the Revenue. The Revenue has good reason for that because tax evasion is not a criminal activity in many of these jurisdictions. I am not sure what is the position in the Cayman Islands and, therefore, if the Revenue was involved that might lessen the chances of a successful outcome to the approach in the Cayman Islands. I do not have a brief but I assume that is part of the reasoning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to transfer the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories and the State laboratory from Abbotstown to Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare. The estimated cost of the new facilities at Backweston is £157 million, including site works, construction costs, design team fees, VAT, inflation, etc.. This level of investment is necessary in order that the State can provide modern state of the art laboratory facilities comparable to the best international standards. Irrespective of the location of the laboratories I further emphasise the investment is essential to ensure the State can guarantee the highest level of food safety and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute laboratories are being moved to Galway in addition to transferring the State laboratory to Backweston. While a comprehensive estimate of the cost of moving the institute laboratories must await the acquisition of a site and establishment of a detailed brief of requirements, the estimated construction costs of the facilities at Galway is £31 million, which includes inflation, fees, VAT etc.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The process has been ongoing and we have not finalised the detail of the information that has been received. We have received some information. All the assessments are being examined in the Department. I am confident the figure I have outlined will be adhered to. I emphasise that irrespective of where the facilities are relocated the costs would be the same and it is important to consider that. The major advantage of moving is that state of the art facilities will be constructed on a green field site. It is also cost-effective for the State because by putting the laboratories together a campus of excellence will be created and facilities such as libraries and conference centres can be put in place which will be available to all the laboratories instead of replicating everything for each laboratory. The facilities will measure up to US and European standards and modern requirements. This is evidenced by the foot and mouth disease problem, which has brought the urgency of this proposal to the fore. The project is proceeding within the time frame I outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that almost four years ago the main plank of his election campaign was a proposed regime of zero tolerance inspired by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Is he aware of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published last week which states that half of all fineable motoring offences, including those liable for on-the-spot fines and others such as drink driving and dangerous driving, went unpunished either by fines or other penalties? In view of the carnage on our roads, how does this record of the <Col N="1307" /> Government square with the policy of zero tolerance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report published last week which I am sure will be examined to ascertain if it is the case that so many on-the-spot fines are not being collected. I have no difficulty with a committee of the House looking into the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding crime generally, we said four years ago that we would cut the crime figures. We have done so. The last figures were 21% down. The provisional figure this year is 26% down. We said that we would increase prison capacity which is up 50%. We also said that we would increase Garda numbers. The force now stands at 11,600. The traffic management strategy launched in 1998 by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, has progressed also. Last week we debated a Bill introducing a points system and other related matters. So far we have done an excellent job in relation to crime and still have 15 months in which to do more.</P>

      <P>Since the Comptroller and Auditor General bases his assessment on information supplied by Departments and others, in this case the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, why has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not done something about the matter when, clearly, he was aware of the situation for over 12 months?</P>

      <P>Where are we in relation to reform <Col N="1308" /> of the legislation governing the conduct of elections, including their funding? On 2 June last the Taoiseach wrote to me advising that it was his intention to have legislation enacted by the end of 2000. On 4 December 2000 he published an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> setting out six areas in which he intended to introduce legislation, some of which had passed Second Stage in this House, including the whistleblower's Bill. On 14 December 2000 the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, perhaps the weakest link in the Administration, published proposals to increase election expenditure by 50%. Since January the Taoiseach has been blocking attempts, both outside and inside the House, through the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government, to discuss Committee Stage of the Labour Party's Bill on political donations. As recently as 21 March that committee, on the instructions of Fianna Fáil, voted against discussing this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral Bill is before the House. Amendments on the level of funding and other issues will shortly be introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The standards in public office Bill is also before the House. Amendments to the anti-corruption Bill are almost finalised. We have accepted Deputy Rabbitte's whistleblowers Bill and will amend it on Committee Stage. I hope most of these Bills will be enacted in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>Acceptance by Deputy Quinn of my outstanding invitation would enable him to influence the Electoral Bill. If he wishes, I would be glad to meet him before the amendments are finalised. If not, we will introduce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also appreciate the correspondence from Deputy Noonan. I wish to enact an Electoral Bill that will stand the test of time and will withstand legal challenge. I do not want to introduce a Bill that becomes a joke as it tries to make definitions that will not work. I also want to introduce spending limits. To impose limits that are too high would be wrong. I have a difficulty with the argument over the distinction between corporate and personal donations. What one may interpret as a corporate donation, another may interpret as a <Col N="1309" /> personal donation. There is no need for me to recite the difficulties involved.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to meet me I am prepared to share the information at my disposal. We do not need to have a row about this. I presume we want to improve matters. There are many other issues to argue over. I am willing to discuss with members of the Opposition ways and means of getting things right in this area. However, if they do not wish to meet I have an obligation to proceed, and I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the long established precedent that Private Members' legislation accepted at Second Stage is amended on Committee Stage? He referred to Deputy Rabbitte's Bill in that regard. A Bill dealing with the funding of political parties and elections has passed Second Stage and is ready for Committee Stage where the Government should introduce its amendments. I fail to understand why the Government members of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government have refused to discuss this matter when the Opposition parties are willing to do so.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has written advice to the effect that corporate donations are unconstitutional he should let us see it. We do not believe they are. I have outlined the litany of promises from the Taoiseach going back to 2 June 2000. One can only conclude that he is committed to the maintenance of corporate donations, that he is in a minority in the House on holding such views and that he is deliberately dragging his heels on the issue to get Fianna Fáil to the far side of the next general election date without reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral Bill is before the Seanad. The Government had not finalised its whistleblowers Bill so we were prepared to accept the Labour Party Bill. The anti-corruption Bill has also been finalised. Apart from the aspects on which we would differ, the Electoral Bill is excellent legislation. We wish to discuss it further.</P>
      <P>From my correspondence with him I am aware Deputy Quinn contends I do not wish to take any further action in this area. I do not wish to argue with him but I assure him he is incorrect. I want to proceed but I do not want to engage in spurious arguments about what is meant by corporate donations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn believes I am delaying on this because I and my party have been collecting enormous amounts of money. If anybody wishes to ascertain what we have collected I am prepared to make the information available to prove that is not the case.</P>

      <P>My concern is to implement a system that will work. There are a number of important issues for the future of politics. It should be relatively easy to obtain all party agreement on a number of areas. From my conversations with Members on all sides of the House, it is evident that people want new rules, regulations and definitions. They also want to ensure that smaller sums of money are involved. However, they do not want a situation to arise where it becomes practically impossible to administer politics. I am not only referring to the next five or ten years but the long-term future. All Members, especially the younger ones, have an interest in this. We should try to proceed together. For the umpteenth time, I am offering to proceed on that basis so we can conclude these matters.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is an honour for me to move the second reading of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, which was published on 29 March. The purpose of the Bill is to seek the agreement of the people to the constitutional changes necessary to allow the State to ratify the Treaty of Nice, which was signed by the 15 Foreign Ministers of the European Union on 26 February. The content of the Bill reflects the detailed legal advice provided to the Government on the nature of the changes which were required for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The decision to have a referendum is based on the clear legal advice that ratification of the Treaty by the State requires constitutional change. This primarily reflects the fact that having carefully identified in the Amsterdam amendment those options or discretions which may be exercised by the State, subject to Oireachtas approval, it is now necessary to make specific provision to permit the exercise of the options or discretions included in the Treaty of Nice. This involves the up-dating and consolidation of the rules governing enhanced co-operation, and the introduction on a limited basis of enhanced co-operation in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In addition, it was also necessary to take account of the extension of the scope of qualified majority voting. Overall, it was clearly desirable that any risk of legal uncertainty on matters of such importance to the State as the treaties establishing the Community and the Union should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to add two additional subsections to Article 29.4 of the Constitution as well as <Col N="1315" /> some consequential renumbering of other sections. First, it provides for a new subsection 7º, which provides that the State may ratify the Treaty of Nice. This is similar to the current references in the Constitution to ratifying earlier EU treaties, including the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Amsterdam. It also provides in the new subsection 8º that the State may exercise certain identified options or discretions included in the Treaty of Nice, all of which relate to various aspects of enhanced co-operation. The approach followed in this regard, in particular the explicit citing of the articles under which the options or discretions arise, is identical to that followed in the case of the analogous provision, subsection 6, included in the Constitution following the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam. In addition and, again, in line with the cross-party agreement reached in respect of the Amsterdam referendum, it is also provided that the exercise of any such options or discretions shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill, as drafted, therefore, is entirely consistent with the approach taken at Amsterdam and follows the pattern of the current wording of Article 29. The provision for parliamentary scrutiny retains an important safeguard agreed in the context of the Amsterdam referendum and one which was a significant element in the all-party consensus achieved at the time.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Treaty of Nice was to bring to a conclusion the process of institutional reform that began with the Treaty of Amsterdam and which was intended to prepare the Union for the admission of a significant number of new member states. The European Council in Cologne in June 1999 decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to settle the issues left unresolved at Amsterdam. These included the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of qualified majority voting and changes in other EU institutions necessitated by enlargement. The European Council in June 2000 subsequently added enhanced co-operation to the agenda.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference began in February 2000 and concluded at the Nice European Council last December. The outcome is a package of measures that will equip the Union to function effectively with a significant increase in membership and at the same time provide the required protection for our essential interests. The treaty will only come into effect if ratified by all 15 member states. Current indications are that this will be done by means of parliamentary approval in the other member states: Ireland is likely to be the only country where a referendum is required to complete the process of ratification. It is, perhaps, interesting to note in this regard that Denmark which, like us, has frequently had recourse to referendums is not doing so on this occasion because the treaty does not involve any <Col N="1316" /> transfer of competence from the member states to the Union.</P>
    <P>The treaty is intended to prepare the way for a significant enlargement of the Union. With the negotiations in the intergovernmental conference now successfully concluded and subject to the ratification of the treaty by each member state, the Union will be in a position to welcome the new member states that are ready as and from the end of 2002. From that point onwards, the pace of accession will be determined solely by the ability of the candidate countries to demonstrate that they are in a position to assume the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to say that the issues at stake are of historic importance. The divisions on the continent of Europe in the past century had led to global conflict on two occasions bringing in its wake slaughter and mass suffering of unimaginable proportions. This was followed by ideological confrontation and massive denial of human rights and fundamental freedom for close to half of our fellow Europeans. Against that background, the success of the European Union in reconciling former enemies and providing in the last four decades a basis for co-operation among a growing number of western European countries has been a phenomenal achievement.</P>
    <P>With the end of the Cold War and the historic changes in central and eastern Europe it is hardly coincidental that so many countries in the region having newly regained their individual voice in international affairs have made plain their determination to move forward within the framework of an enlarged European Union. They recognise, with perhaps greater clarity than some inside the Union, that broadening the Union to embrace the applicant states can serve to consolidate newly won democratic freedoms and lay the basis for a new era of stability and prosperity for the Continent as a whole.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that Ireland, no less than our partners, has a vital interest in these developments. A peaceful and stable Europe is, clearly, in Ireland's interest. Small countries, in particular, benefit from a settled international order. However, for an open economy like ours it is, in addition, a vital underpinning of our domestic economic well-being.</P>
    <P>We, in Ireland, are in an excellent position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by enlargement. Irish business currently has access to a market of 370 million. With the completion of the current enlargement process this would expand to some 550 million. Irish exporters are already well placed in these markets. Irish exports to the central and eastern European applicant countries rose by 337% to £586 million in the five years to 1999. These countries also provide excellent investment opportunities for Irish companies. For example, in Poland Irish investment is already in excess of US$1 billion.</P>
    <P>Given that some critics of the treaty have suggested that they are reflecting the concerns of the applicant countries, it should be noted that reac<Col N="1317" /> tion to it has been very positive in the candidate states. For example, the Polish Foreign Minister said, &ldquo;The Treaty of Nice is a sound and good starting point for European states on the threshold of the Third Millennium&rdquo;. The Romanian Foreign Minister described the outcome as &ldquo;very encouraging&rdquo; while his Cypriot counterpart said that he was &ldquo;very satisfied with the outcome of Nice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given the importance these countries attach to gaining entry to the Union, their reaction is scarcely surprising. Moreover, many of them have already made considerable progress in effecting the changes necessary for membership. I am confident that the Irish people, for whom the memory of the challenges we faced in making a similar transition some 30 years ago is not so distant, wish these countries well and are ready to extend the hand of friendship, co-operation and solidarity, just as we were helped at the equivalent stage in our development.</P>
    <P>That is the background from which the new treaty has emerged and against which it should be judged. The ultimate responsibility in this regard will fall on the people when they cast their votes in the referendum. Can anyone seriously suggest that it is in Ireland's interests to vote down the treaty since it constitutes the vehicle for accession of the new democracies in Europe? Apart from the inherent benefits attaching to enlargement, Ireland has a strategy for increasing direct representation in these countries. Were we to vote down the Treaty of Nice, how could it be argued that was in the interests of our bilateral relations? On the contrary, a negative vote could be construed as giving succour to reactionary forces eager to exploit any difficulties to the detriment of democratic forces aiming to restructure the economies of emerging countries. Is there a serious body of political opinion in Ireland which would promote a policy so injurious to the interests of our trading partners? In view of the importance with which all Europeans view the enlargement project, I am confident the Irish people will adopt an outward-looking approach and enable those in the new Europe to have a chance to gain their full potential by joining the European Union.</P>
    <P>From a political and historical perspective, it is vital that Ireland seizes the opportunity to affirm support for the European project. It is equally important that a young nation should confirm the people's overwhelming support for the prospect of Poles, Hungarians and Czechs among others &ndash; parents and children &ndash; making a reality of the hopes we had when we voted in such large numbers for accession in 1972. If the public approves the treaty, this will greatly enhance Ireland's standing internationally. By reason of our constitutional position, it falls uniquely to the people of Ireland &ndash; as distinct from Parliaments in other member states &ndash; to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the emerging democracies, to vote on behalf of the people in these new democracies as well as on our own behalf for enlargement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> To assist in maximising public awareness, the Government has published a White Paper to outline and explain the changes that will be made by the treaty. The White Paper provides a factual, comprehensive and readable account of what the treaty contains and is available free of charge on request from my Department. Because of the importance of encouraging citizens to familiarise themselves with the treaty provisions, a summary of the White Paper has also been prepared and, in a new development, will be distributed to every household in the State. Provision has also been made to make copies of the summary available in Braille and on audio tape for persons with a sight disability. It is hoped these arrangements, which are more comprehensive than in any recent EU referendum, will facilitate the kind of informed debate issues of this importance clearly merit.</P>
    <P>I am confident that those who fairly consider the issues will conclude that the treaty is right for Europe and right for Ireland in Europe. It is, clearly, in Ireland's interest that an enlarged Union can continue to function properly and take decisions for which the treaty provides while maintaining in place necessary safeguards in sensitive areas and the fundamental balances that are the hallmark of the Union. That is borne out by a closer examination of what was decided under the various headings. It was agreed, for example, that qualified majority voting should be extended to some 30 additional areas. This reflects the fact that it, simply, does not make sense in a Union of 27 to allow a single member state to block a proposal on which a significant majority of states might otherwise be agreed. A case in point is the decision to extend QMV to international agreements in the field of services and intellectual property subject to certain safeguards. As a trading nation, it is very much in our interest that the Community should be in a position to negotiate effectively in world trade fora. Switching to QMV makes this more likely and thereby contributes to employment and prosperity at home. While ready to facilitate QMV in many additional areas, we insisted on the retention of unanimity for all aspects of taxation. We emphasised that this was an area vital to our economic transformation and must remain subject to agreement by all member states. The conclusion reached was entirely satisfactory and fully protects our position.</P>
    <P>The outcome on the composition of the Commission by now is well known. It was agreed that from 2005, the date of appointment of the next Commission, the five large states will forego their right to nominate a second member of the Commission. From that date the Commission will comprise one nominee from each member state. That arrangement, obviously, has the effect &ndash; ignored by critics of the treaty &ndash; of reducing by 50% large state representation on the Commission. That will continue to apply until the Union reaches 27 member states, an outcome which is, clearly, some years away. At that point the Commission will decide, by unanimity, on a size for the Commission less than 27. A key <Col N="1319" /> element of the agreement reached at Nice was that the rotation of seats on the Commission will take place on the basis of strict equality between member states, irrespective of size or population.</P>
    <P>The practical result is that for the next decade each member state, including the newly admitted members, will be entitled to nominate a member of the Commission. When eventually the Union reaches 27, a decision on size will be taken by unanimity, with the full participation of the new members. Any arrangement must be on the basis of the strict equality of member states. I believed at Nice, as I do now, that with the other small and medium sized states, both members and applicants, that this represents a good deal, and constitutes a reasonable basis for agreement as part of a satisfactory overall package.</P>
    <P>As regards the weighting of votes, it was, of course, recognised at Amsterdam that the large states would be compensated for giving up their second Commissioner by an increase in their weighted vote. The outcome at Nice is consistent with that understanding. However, it also contains important safeguards for smaller countries. In Ireland's case we will have 2.03% of the total vote, compared to 2.2% on a simple extrapolation of the existing weights in an enlarged Union. Put another way, with 0.8% of the population in a Union of 27, we will have a voting weight more than two and half times our population equivalent. We will also have the same voting weight as Finland and Denmark, two countries with populations larger than ours.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that decision-making will be made difficult by the requirement that decisions have the support of at least 62% of the Union's population. While this represents a small increase on the rate which currently applies, claims of a radical transformation in the balance of power are unconvincing when it is recalled that, until 1995, the equivalent rate was 63%, and was over 70% at earlier stages of the Union's development. In addition, as a further safeguard, it was agreed at Nice, in response to a proposal from the smaller countries, that for the first time an explicit provision be made in the Treaty that no decision can be taken without the support of at least a majority of member states.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from these inevitably complex statistical provisions, we should not lose sight of the fact that in reality influence in the Council is based on forging alliances with like-minded states, and that issues rarely divide on the basis of size. Ireland, under successive Governments, has shown itself adept at protecting its interests. There is no reason to doubt that we will be any less effective in an enlarged Union. The outcome at Nice with regard to the other European institutions can also be regarded as satisfactory. In the case of the European Parliament, we will continue to have representation more than double that to which we would be entitled on a population basis. In fact, with the exception of Luxem<Col N="1320" /> bourg which is a special case, we will have the best seat to population ratio of any member state.</P>
    <P>Among those areas of the Treaty to which perhaps insufficient attention has been paid is the significant set of reforms agreed with regard to the Court of Justice. This will equip the court to deal with an already growing case load, a situation which will inevitably accelerate further with enlargement. Among the reforms is an expanded role for the Court of First Instance. This will relieve the Court of Justice of some of the burden which it now carries and allow it to deal only with important cases. The treaties will also stipulate, for the first time, that the Court of Justice is to comprise one judge from each member state. There is a similar strengthening of the entitlement of each member state to representation on the Court of Auditors. It was also possible to ensure that Ireland's representation on the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions will remain unchanged after enlargement.</P>
    <P>The treaty also provides for some adjustments in the rules on enhanced co-operation, including ending the right of a single member state to veto the establishment of a group, except in the second pillar area where the veto will continue to apply. I want immediately to rebut suggestions that this will lead to the creation of an inner core, from which we will be excluded, or to the emergence of a two-speed Europe. I have on previous occasions outlined the various safeguards which will ensure that this does not happen; the fact that it will not apply to any aspect of the Single Market which consists of more than 80% of the activities of the Union; the fact that under CFSP it will be limited to implementation of decisions taken under normal procedures, and is specifically excluded from the security and defence area; the guarantee that every new group will be open to participation by any member state; and the increased role for the Commission in monitoring its operation to ensure the overall coherence of the Union.</P>
    <P>Far from constituting a single inner core, the composition of each group will vary from issue to issue, with members free to join those groups in which they wish to participate. In reality, the tightly drawn rules for enhanced co-operation are likely to limit the scope for its application, and it will continue, as the Treaty explicitly provides, to be used as a mechanism of last resort. However, having secured the necessary safeguards, I put it to the House that to have kept in place an arrangement which allowed a single member state in a Union of 27 to block a proposal on which other member states were agreed would have been contrary to the interests of the Union. Here, as elsewhere, the decisions taken at Nice put in place sensible arrangements, properly ring-fenced, to ensure that an enlarged Union can continue to function and to take the decisions it needs. This is what enhanced co-operation is about, no more and no less.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the historic process of enlargement in which the EU is engaged, the <Col N="1321" /> European Union is continuing to seek ways of playing a greater role for peace, stability and security in Europe. Ireland has a strong interest in maintaining a stable, inclusive security environment. I believe it is essential for Ireland to be centrally involved in shaping future changes in the direction that we would wish to see them take. Ireland pursues this objective not only through the common foreign policy of the European Union but also through the primary role of the United Nations, and other international organisations.</P>
    <P>The development of the common foreign and security policy, under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, has led to an enhancement of the capacity of the EU to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks, known as the Petersberg tasks. Existing security arrangements and procedures have been adapted to carry out these tasks and Ireland is actively and constructively participating in improving European responses to challenges which can arise. Important steps have been taken in developing an EU capability to undertake crisis management tasks. Decisions to this effect, elaborating the European security and defence policy, have been taken by the European Council at successive meetings at Cologne, Helsinki, Feira and, most recently, at Nice.</P>
    <P>Any participation by Ireland in a Petersberg task would be a sovereign decision by the Government and approached on a case by case basis. Also, in line with the Government's policy of military neutrality, the Government has made clear that Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations, in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval. The existing treaty provisions were intended to make the common foreign and security policy of the EU more coherent, more visible and more effective. The Treaty of Nice has made only limited changes in this area. References to the Western European Union have been deleted. Also, a treaty basis is provided for the political and security committee, which meets in Brussels. I will briefly outline the background to these limited changes.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Amsterdam Treaty, it was envisaged that the Western European Union would play a key role, acting on behalf of the EU, in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention. However, given the development of the Union's capabilities in this area, the role of the Western European Union has diminished. The deletion of the clauses concerning the Western European Union can therefore be seen in the light of the evolution of the European security and defence policy and of a desire to update the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice also provides for the replacement of the existing political committee, which comprised representatives from capitals, by a political and security committee, based in Brussels, operating on instructions from the respective Governments. The new committee will assume functions relating to the conduct of the common <Col N="1322" /> foreign and security policy. As part of its responsibilities, the political and security committee may exercise, under the authority of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is concerned with preparing for enlargement, but it is, of course, also about the continuing development of the Union, of which we have been a full and committed member for almost three decades. During that period the Irish people have enjoyed substantial economic benefits, reflected in unprecedented levels of employment, growth and prosperity. Our network of roads and services have benefited substantially from Structural Funds assistance, averaging more than 2% of GNP during the 1990s. Similarly, our education and training programmes have benefited greatly under the European Social Fund down through the years. We have gained from and contributed to important advances in areas like the environment, social programmes, equal rights for men and women and consumer protection, all matters of direct concern to every citizen in the country. Nobody seriously believes that these advances would have been achieved to anything like the same extent if we were outside the Union.</P>
    <P>However, support for our full participation in the Union is not based on economic calculation alone. Being at the heart of Europe has given Ireland the opportunity to bring its distinctive voice to a wider audience. In return we have opened ourselves to new currents and influences which have both broadened our experience and enriched our national life. Nobody realises this more than our present generation of young people. They know, many of them through practical experience, that whether in Paris, Prague, Dublin or Warsaw, we are part of a common enterprise, facing the same issues of worthwhile jobs, strengthening our communities and building a decent society in which all can participate. These are the real challenges facing the Union in the years ahead. That is why I am confident the Irish people will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to enlargement and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a mature, confident and internationally responsible Ireland remaining at the forefront of the European Union.</P>

      <P>What is at stake in this debate is the enlargement of the EU and the institutional changes necessary to accommodate the additional members. I make it clear that Fine Gael has always strongly advocated and supported enlargement of the EU. However, that process is at risk as passage of the referendum approving the Nice Treaty which will give effect to the institutional changes cannot be taken for granted. The process is being put at risk by the Government, particularly because the date proposed for the referendum displays a total disregard for the foot and mouth crisis. Traditionally, farmers have been great supporters of the EU, but they have so many problems now I do not think their minds <Col N="1323" /> are focused on enlargement. It makes no sense whatever for the referendum to proceed on 31 May as proposed by the Government. Even in the UK, where not much notice has been taken of the foot and mouth crisis, the Prime Minister has decided not to hold elections in May.</P>
      <P>It is not only the foot and mouth crisis that makes me call for a postponement of the referendum. The Government is displaying a complete disregard for the democratic process by allowing only eight weeks between publication of the White Paper on 29 March and the proposed referendum on 31 May. This is a further compelling reason for the postponement of the referendum until autumn. We must bear in mind that the requirement is to have ratification procedures completed by the end of next year, and from that point of view it is wrong for the Government to approach the issue with the unseemly haste evident from the current preparations. Apart from the legislative process in the Dáil and Seanad, the Referendum Commission will have to arrange for the preparation of two reports on the treaty, one in favour and one against, and arrange for the circulation of them throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes it is hugely important that we have a reasoned debate on the treaty. The more reasoned the debate the better prospect the referendum will be passed. The more people are aware that the treaty is designed to provide a framework for an EU of perhaps 30 members in the next 15 years the more they can be convinced of the merits of enlargement. However, a reasoned debate requires adequate time for full discussion of all aspects of the treaty.</P>
      <P>The issue of time for debating serious issues and referendums was discussed by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Its draft report on the referendum process examined this issue and looked at referendums in an historical context. There is agreement in the draft report that a referendum places people in a position analogous to that of a judge hearing a case. An issue of such major importance as the Nice Treaty requires adequate preparation and presentation so the people can exercise considered judgment. The quality of the judgment will of course depend on the clarity with which the facts underpinning the proposal are placed before the people and the cogency of the arguments made by both sides. All of this takes time, and the all-party committee's draft report suggested three months should elapse from the initiation of a Bill to amend the Constitution and its passing by the Oireachtas. The draft report stated that in an emergency time could be abridged. This gives an indication of the seriousness with which the all-party committee viewed the need for reasoned debate and time so as to ensure constitutional Bills are not rushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The all-party committee also examined the bringing home to people of arguments for and against an amendment to the Constitution. It fully recognised the need for indepth debate and recommended that legislation should require that <Col N="1324" /> all proposals to amend the Constitution be examined and debated by the all-party committee and that there should subsequently be a further period of 90 days following passage by the Dáil before the referendum takes place. I accept these are only draft proposals in a draft report, but they give an indication of the trend of thinking of members of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty is one of the most important issues with which the people will be faced and it is hugely important that people are given every opportunity to have a reasoned debate on it. The biggest danger is that if adequate time is not allowed for the debate and if arrangements are not put in place for it, a substantial number of people may be prepared to vote no on the basis of not understanding it. A survey carried out following the last EU referendum found that a major proportion of the people who voted against the referendum did so because they did not understand it. They felt they were being asked to buy a pig in a poke. The onus is on all of us, but especially the Government, to make the case and to bring clarity where there is confusion. In that situation, time will be needed to discharge that onus. I suggest to the Government that it forgets the date of 31 May. The foot and mouth disease crisis is limiting public meetings at the moment but irrespective of that, there would still not be sufficient time for reasoned debate.</P>
    <P>My second point which relates to the referendum is that I believe the Treaty of Nice merits a referendum on its own. Four referenda on disparate matters on the same day displays a level of contempt for the Constitution. Despite the importance of the other issues proposed, they will not affect the daily lives and future of our citizens in the way that a re-ordering of the structures underpinning the Union will. The Constitution has been amended on 19 separate occasions over the past 60 years. Governments should not tinker with the Constitution. This Government should ensure that a crucial amendment such as that relating to the Treaty of Nice is crystal clear and not clouded by other matters. The Treaty of Nice is too important for the future of Ireland and Europe and so it is imperative that the public be fully informed and totally focused when they vote on referendum day. I have in the past been critical of the Government's negotiating strategy and stance leading to the conclusion of the Treaty of Nice. The Government will compound the problem if it foists a referendum on the country in unseemly haste without allowing ample opportunity for informed debate. It is imperative that there be a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>The other referenda proposed for 31 May include the referendum on the death penalty, the international criminal court and the proposed judicial council. They could all be taken together on a separate date and the referendum on the Treaty of Nice could be held separately on another day.</P>
    <P>The Government should not take chances on this. The record of voting in relation to European <Col N="1325" /> matters has shown a decline in support since 1972. The usual suspects will come out with the usual popular rhetoric against this treaty. We should also be aware that this popular rhetoric has garnered more support with each referendum. My concern is that the referendum could be lost if that happens and it would be a disaster for Ireland and for Europe. We are the only country in the European Union to have a referendum on the treaty. Every country must ratify the treaty. Unless there is a positive result in the referendum, Ireland cannot ratify the treaty and therefore there will not be ratification by the European Union.</P>
    <P>When we are looking for a reasoned debate on the future of Europe, we must bear in mind recent hot-headed and intemperate megaphone diplomacy by Ministers of this Government. There were interventions from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. I wonder did the Ministers concerned bear in mind at the time that this country was in the process of major, serious negotiations with other member states which ultimately led to the Treaty of Nice and which is now required to be approved by the people. The same Ministers who made those intemperate remarks will now have to be prepared to go before the people to convince them of the need to vote for the Treaty of Nice and so allow enlargement of the European Union. The Ministers concerned will be required to give an explanation to the people of the unseemly row with the European Commission, the euro-sceptical articles written, particularly one in <i>The Financial </i>Times, the declared preference for Boston over Berlin or Brussels.</P>
    <P>If there are problems with this referendum, the Government will have many questions to answer. I now put down a marker &ndash; these problems are there. There has been a development of euro-scepticism and it has not been caused by the consequences of the old popular rhetoric against the European Union. It has been encouraged and supported by the very rhetoric of this Government. It is an issue which must be confronted and the Government must be prepared to accept its responsibilities in the matter. The Government cannot have it both ways, it cannot cock a snook at Europe while at the same time encourage people to vote in favour of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is an indication of work in progress in the European Union. The construction of post-war Europe, and now the post-Cold War Europe, was not ever going to be achieved by one treaty or agreement. This treaty represents the stepping-stone to the historical imperative of European union for the entire Continent, to include the Baltic States, the Balkans, and the islands of Cyprus and Malta. Twelve candidate countries are to be admitted over the next ten years. The Union will grind to a halt if the structures and institutions created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and left largely intact since <Col N="1326" /> then, are not replaced by a modern and efficient set of institutions.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice represents a decisive step in fashioning a new Europe. When we hear the popular rhetoric about the treaty, we should remember that this treaty neither sets up a European army, nor does it introduce any common scale of moral values to the European Union. Its sole aim is to reform the institutions and structures of the Union and make them flexible and adaptable in a Union comprised of 25 or 30 member states. Ireland's success in recent years is due in no small part to our membership of the club and with it access to the European markets. Many of the applicant states are as poor if not poorer than Ireland was in 1972. Many have only won freedom within the last decade. Their membership of the Union is essential for their own secure development. The representatives of those countries make it quite clear that their first priority in foreign policy is to secure membership of the European Union. While our days as net beneficiaries of EU funding are ending, the benefits of EU membership are not to be gauged merely in financial flows. As an exporting country, the prospect of a European Union with a population of more than 500 million must be considered attractive.</P>
    <P>The question is how best to convince the people of the merits of this treaty. This aspect was not helped by the negotiating stance of the Government. The Taoiseach repeatedly stated up to December 2000, that retaining a member of the European Commission was an article of faith. The outcome is that Ireland will lose its automatic right to nominate a Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The people should have been brought more into the confidence of this Government on the negotiating position. I accept that the larger member states will lose their second Commissioner. I also accept that the larger member states will share in the rotating commissionerships with Ireland and the other smaller member states when the number of members exceeds 27 and reductions have to be made. However, to not inform the public about that possibility before the treaty was concluded was the wrong negotiating strategy. To say it was an article of faith on the part of the Taoiseach and the Irish negotiating team that under no circumstances would we lose a Commissioner was misinforming the public.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I felt the Government took its eye off the ball in the fuss it created over retaining a veto on tax matters. It was never an issue.</P>

      <P>Indeed. My concern is that the Government took its eye off the ball and focused on what were not serious negotiating issues, and did not achieve what could have been achieved. Where criticism is merited it should be given. I will not say to the public that the Nice Treaty is perfect. I would prefer if the article of faith, as enunciated by the Taoiseach before Nice, was retained. I would also prefer if there was not the transfer of power in the Council of Ministers to the larger member states. I accept the larger states gave up their second Commissioner and that there had to be a certain <i>quid pro quo.</i> However, as one who has attended the Council of Ministers over a period of five years, and has seen its huge relevance to the decision-making process, I would have preferred a better deal there.</P>
      <P>I see these as legitimate criticisms but at the same time it is necessary to see the wood for the trees. We must accept that the fundamental thrust of the treaty was to reach agreement. That agreement could have been better from an Irish point of view but it cannot now be re-negotiated just because we disagree with some aspects. In the overall interests of both Ireland and Europe it is necessary to back the treaty. It is necessary to put the treaty to the people, ask for their support and encourage them to support it.</P>
      <P>The House can be assured of the full support of Fine Gael in seeking a positive outcome when the matter goes before the people, but I strongly put the view to the Government that the referendum should not take place on 31 May 2001 and should be dealt with as a single issue on a separate day.</P>
      <P>Endorsement of the Nice Treaty by Fine Gael does not mean my party endorses Government policy on Europe and its institutions. We look forward to the next intergovernmental conference, which will get under way soon, and which may culminate at a time when Ireland will next hold the EU Presidency in 2004. It is important that we have more debate, in this House and outside, on what Ireland should seek at that conference. Effectively, this Government adopted a defensive mode of negotiation on the last treaty and gave the impression that Ireland had not much of significance to offer. I feel Ministers and Prime Ministers of other Governments have already given an indication of the kind of Europe they want shaped. We need that kind of debate in Ireland. We need to indicate the vision that we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more immediate job is to deal with the Nice Treaty. Fine Gael strongly endorses the enlargement of the European Union. We have had reservations on the Government's approach during and since the treaty negotiations but we believe, in the overall interests of the country and Europe, that the Nice Treaty should be ratified. On that basis we will support the treaty and will actively campaign for the approval of the treaty by the people. I hope the proposals I have made on postponing the vote until the autumn and on <Col N="1328" /> putting the treaty before the people as a single issue will be adopted by this Government.</P>

      <P>The sight of NATO bombers over Yugoslavia over two years ago excited strong emotions among many Irish people. The rights and wrongs of the NATO action split families and divided political parties on all sides of the House. It is not surprising that people in Ireland felt so strongly about the NATO campaign. It is fair to say that Ireland was spared a great deal in Europe's century of genocide that began with the First World War, but many of our citizens have immediate and personal reasons for recalling the slaughter that both world wars let loose. Many of us, particularly on this side of the Border, have taken for granted the last 50 years of relative peace. Others know how important it has been. I say &ldquo;relative peace&rdquo; because that is what it has been. The establishment of the Iron Curtain at the end of the Second World War as the Red army won the race to Berlin was perhaps inevitable. But for the people of eastern Europe it had horrible and disastrous consequences, even if the death of Stalin spared them the horrors meted out to the Soviet people themselves in the previous decade. The people who suffered enormously at the hands of barbaric Nazism were to be subject to Soviet backed authoritarianism for a further 50 years. Their emergence into relative daylight after the collapse of the Soviet Union, thankfully peacefully due to the efforts of Mikhail Gorbachev, has not been without tension and difficulties. The disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, ironically one of the most independent states of the Soviet Union, has been particularly painful.</P>
      <P>This is the historical background to the Treaty of Nice. Those countries fortunate enough to escape the Red army set about, through the nascent institutions of the European Union, rebuilding their continent. By any standards they have been spectacularly successful. Western Europe, despite the ravages of war, has enjoyed its longest period of peace time prosperity in living memory. Centuries of political tensions between states such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany have given way to benign and tolerant co-operation. That is not to say that everything has been perfect, but it cannot be denied that, as an experiment in peace building and its maintenance between former bitter enemies, the European Union has been successful.</P>
      <P>Ireland was a late entry to the Union, partly because of the veto exercised by General de Gaulle until the late 1960s. We joined, with Denmark and the United Kingdom, in 1973. In that period our society and economy have been transformed. We have become a more open and outward looking society and, with the direct assistance in part of our European colleagues, transformed our economy. On a number of fronts, membership of the European Union has been good for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question facing the people when the refer<Col N="1329" /> endum on the Nice Treaty is held is whether we are prepared to extend the benefits of our experience to countries such as Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. There is, simply, no way that we could refuse. In essence, that is what the Treaty of Nice is about and, for that reason, my party will be supporting it. That is not to say that, because we are supporting the treaty, my party cannot and will not be critical of the Government's policy in Europe and on Europe. I make no apologies for being so critical because the Government's approach to Europe has been hamfisted and short sighted. In so doing it has given comfort to those who seek to oppose the treaty. From day one, when the Taoiseach sought and failed to appoint the Minister for Defence as a kind of Minister for European Affairs, the Government's approach to European issues has not developed in line with our changing position within Europe.</P>
    <P>As part of our approach to the Nice Treaty and to prepare for the important intergovernmental conference in 2004, the Labour Party will be proposing the establishment of a forum on Europe to provide a proper basis on which the precise nature of Ireland's evolving relationship with our European partners and the shape Europe should take in coming decades can be debated by all sides. I argued for a number of years that it was time to decommission the begging bowl and adopt a more mature and forceful position within the European Union, but the impression that we only look to the Union to see what we can get out of it has strengthened rather than diminished under the Government. Recent statements from the Tánaiste and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in conjunction with the Minister for Finance's phoney and ridiculous war with his European colleagues have all helped to bolster this impression.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Party has been critical of the Government's policy towards Europe, it has been from a pro-European rather than an anti-European perspective. We want Ireland to play a greater role in Europe, to work constructively to influence European Union thinking in line with Irish positions and aspirations. For example, in the foreign affairs field, we have always thought that the values that led to the foundation of the European Union are far more appropriate to the problems of conflict resolution and security than those of either of the Cold War adversaries. Despite the fears generated by those opposed to an EU foreign policy, Irish participation has not given rise to the doomsday scenarios predicted by some and nothing in the Nice Treaty will change this.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party wants to see Ireland become more European. We see little point in our country enjoying the massive levels of economic growth we have recently enjoyed unless we can achieve the degree of social supports and quality of life commonly experienced by our European counterparts. Labour is not a Euro-sceptic party <Col N="1330" /> and on this point we are united. Unfortunately, the Irish people have not been encouraged to think on these lines. We have been encouraged by the same Irish Ministers who have criticised President Bush this week for his dangerous environmental policies to aspire to his socio-economic system. All this despite the fact that it is precisely his economic philosophy and its disregard for the importance of environmental and social regulations that have led to his rejection of the Kyoto accord. The danger for the Government in how it has approached this issue is that it has encouraged people to think of the European issue in that limited self-interested fashion. That is the basis on which the campaign against the treaty will be based. Its opponents will argue that Ireland is losing out.</P>
    <P>I, for one, was not pleased that the principle of one Commissioner per country was not enshrined in the conclusions at Nice. The Commission acts as guarantor for small nations that their voice will be heard. There have been umpteen occasions when the existence of an Irish Commissioner has been instrumental in assisting Irish delegations at difficult moments. There have been worrying signs in recent years of a creeping intergovernmentalism within the European Union. It, certainly, seems to be an approach favoured in London and one to which, ironically, this Nationalist Government has been in thrall. It is a mistaken approach. I have argued in recent years that, as a small country, we should have been cementing alliances and building relationships with the aspirant countries which would naturally look to Ireland as an example of how a small country could do well in the Union. My entreaties have been ignored by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government is now in its fourth year with unprecedented wealth. Yet, we still do not have resident embassies in all the applicant countries. We do not have embassies in Cyprus, Estonia or Slovenia, countries which are likely to be in the first run of applicant countries. We could have been developing programmes of bilateral solidarity and promoting tangible alliances with those countries, but we have not been doing so. The Minister and the Taoiseach may argue that he is the first Taoiseach, systematically, to visit most of these countries. That is true. However, a flying visit, no matter how welcome, is merely a door opening exercise and must be followed up by consolidated programmes of action. I encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose influence within the Cabinet is well understood, to look again at speeding up the programme of diplomatic representation in the applicant countries on the basis of those likely to be among the first to join the European Union.</P>
    <P>I was annoyed, too, by the duplicitous nature of Government spinning over the weekend of the Treaty negotiations. The public is tired of posturing by politicians and the news feed over the weekend of the Nice Treaty that the Taoiseach was holding out bravely against attacks on our tax regime was too much to stomach. Our tax regime, <Col N="1331" /> no more than that of the British, the Austrians or the Swedes, was under attack that weekend. Attacks were articulated and the French, in particular, were very strident in their criticism, but it was obvious that Ireland, with Austria, Luxembourg, Sweden and Britain, was clear in its opposition to changes in relation to taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the French argument that there should be tax harmonisation, for two reasons. First, with the advent of the euro we will have a common currency shared among a number of sovereign states, but we do not know how the currency will perform over the full business cycle and we do not have a clear picture of how this brave experiment will work in difficult times. For that reason, having given away two instruments of macro-economic management, the exchange rate and interest rates, it is essential that member states retain a key degree of sovereignty in relation to taxation, for the time being. In the future there may be compelling arguments for tax harmonisation, but we have a long way to go before we begin to harmonise rates of tax. We could, for example, harmonise the basis on which corporation tax is applied. If the exemptions and concessions granted by Holland or Germany to many of their companies were removed, their effective corporate tax rates would be much lower than their nominal rates. In other countries there is the phenomenon of designer taxes whereby individual companies can negotiate separate tax deals for themselves, something which would be unthinkable in this country.</P>
    <P>The other reason I think the whole issue of tax harmonisation is a phoney argument, and one that could have been made in the context of the debate in Nice and, perhaps, it was, is that the United States, which is a much more integrated federal union than the European Union might ever become, does not have tax harmonisation. Tax competition is a positive instrument of policy and economic development between states in the Union. One has only to think of tax competition across the River Hudson between New York state and New Jersey in respect of how the various states of the union use tax independence and tax sovereignty to promote their own economic interests for the needs of the union. For those reasons the Government was right to argue for retaining the whole question of independence and sovereignty in relation to tax. I never believed, notwithstanding what was shouted out loud, it was under serious threat. The Irish Government was in a position where all its armaments of defence were drawn into fighting that battle and the question of the principle of one Commissioner was lost in the process. Those negotiations were not easy. A deal had to be done after four days and it is now history.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the accession of the eastern European countries to the Union will open up more opportunities for Irish business, a matter to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred. <Col N="1332" /> If the last decade has taught us anything it should be that as an open trading nation we are among the best. Free trade, such as that within the European Union, should not threaten us as long as we continue to concentrate sufficiently on improving domestic productivity and competitiveness, but these will not be points made by the Treaty's opponents. Those who argued that Maastricht would herald doom and gloom were wrong. They were wrong about Amsterdam also and any such predictions on a similar basis about Nice will be inaccurate.</P>
    <P>I note that some opponents of the Treaty have sought to make use of my comments in the Dáil upon the negotiation of the Treaty. They seek to portray me as an anti-European of some kind. I fail to see, however, how people like Mr. Coughlan, an anti-European, can take any comfort from the frustrations of a passionate pro-European that the Nice Treaty is not as good as it might be. If I have stood against one thing consistently in all my time in politics, it is against the narrow-minded definitions of national self interest espoused by him and others. It is people like him who have argued in favour of a purer form of intergovernmentalism than that contemplated at Nice and I said in my pre-Christmas statement the most dramatic monument to European intergovernmentalism is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Europeans have had three centuries of so-called intergovernmentalism which has led us into numerous wars and conflicts and the oppression of small nations by large nations. The European Union is the alternative to intergovernmentalism.</P>
    <P>There are elements of the Nice Treaty that could be better. It is true that there are some issues that could be revisited. It is also true that this treaty must be accepted for better or for worse as it is. It cannot be renegotiated. We cannot opt out of the core decision-making process of the Union. It is not a situation comparable to the one in which the Danes found themselves after Maastricht. In that light it would be a travesty for Ireland as a post colonial country to deny the benefits of European Union membership to other post colonial countries in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Last Friday, following an exchange between myself and the Taoiseach on the Order of Business, I wrote to him asking him to think again about the timing of this referendum. I wish to repeat that call here today. I do not believe it is possible to have the debate we need and to get the resounding result that it merits if we proceed to have the referendum on 31 May. It may well be that the realities of the foot and mouth disease throughout the country will make such a date inoperable. Even if there was not the problem of foot and mouth disease we should not have the referendum now. Deputy O'Keeffe has cited the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and its recommendation that amendments to the Constitution should, in future, be preceded by a substantial period before being put to the people.</P>
    <P>Debate about this treaty, and the realities <Col N="1333" /> Ireland would face, were practically non-existent before the negotiations began. I recall one high profile speech by the Taoiseach at the Institute of European Affairs and before the negotiations commenced in Nice a major speech at the Irish Council for the European Union Movement. Other than that and a few questions across the floor and some dialogue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs there was little or no debate. It is a mistake to think that this issue is exclusively one for the Department of Foreign Affairs or for the Minister and for the relevant spokespersons of the two parties. European issues are central to virtually every Government Department as is reflected in the composition and size of the permanent representation in Brussels, whether it is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or any other Department of substance to which the Minister may refer. Much of what they do is defined by what is happening in Europe. No disrespect to the Department or the Minister for Foreign Affairs but to assume it is a debate over there rather than here is a mistake. We did not have the debate over here. There was a class of debate but it was not adequate.</P>
    <P>I believe the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has decided that there should be a 90 day gap between the publishing of a Bill to amend the Constitution and the holding of a referendum. I see no reason that all-party recommendation cannot be applied in this instance. It may be forced upon the Government by necessity but, if so, that space should be properly filled. No doubt the committee has picked up upon the clear message sent by the public to this House at the time of the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality. It does not wish to be asked to determine on issues it does not understand fully. In the case of the Nice Treaty, public debate, as opposed to debate within the confines of these walls, is only beginning. It will be circumscribed, probably, by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some years now, and evident in support for further European integration in referenda in this State, that the citizens of Europe feel increasingly remote from the European Union and its decision-making structures. Opponents of the European process who to date have remained a minority in this country have long argued that there is a conspiracy at play between political establishments at home and in Europe to deny the people proper control of the process.</P>
    <P>If this referendum proceeds on 31 May, it is an argument that I believe will be used again, possibly to powerful effect. That the Treaty will receive support, albeit critical, from the main parties in this House, will encourage those who will seek to present this Treaty as an opportunity to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at the political establishment. The treaty does not have to be ratified until the end of next year, December 2002. Why not allow the debate to be a reasonably long one? Why not <Col N="1334" /> allow the European Parliament, made up of the democratically elected representatives of the Irish people and the other peoples of the European Union, to conclude its adjudication on the treaty? Why should not the public be given the time to inform itself fully about the issues surrounding the decision it will take? Those of us who support this treaty have nothing to fear from a prolonged and informed debate. Why should those who seek to oppose the treaty not be forced to make substantive arguments in favour of their largely isolationist positions and to win the argument on merit rather than charging the majority in this House that we are afraid to debate this issue openly? We should not allow those who oppose this treaty to use general cynicism about the political process at home as part of their argument.</P>
    <P>It would be a sad irony that parties in this House who argue in favour of the rights of small nations and in favour of localised decision-making would reject a process, however flawed, that would grant to other small nations member status of the EU that could well be critical to their functioning as democracies, let alone as prospering economies.</P>
    <P>This treaty is not perfect. This treaty is flawed but behind it there is an underlying historical logic. Peace and stability on this Continent which has brought war to all four corners of the globe is in all our interest, long-term and short-term. Regardless of whatever reservations we have about this treaty, we should vote for it. We have done well out of the Union and I would argue unashamedly that now is the time to give a little back.</P>
    <P>If the Nice Treaty is endorsed by the Irish people &ndash; as I hope it will &ndash; it will not be the end of the process. We will still be faced with important issues and questions that have yet to be resolved and which were not resolved at Nice. The next intergovernmental conference is likely to be in 2004 and will, in all probability, coincide with the next Irish Presidency which will run from January to June of that year. We must ensure we do not repeat the mistakes made in the run-up to the Nice summit, largely due to the disastrous handling of the negotiations by the French. There must be adequate consultation and discussion in advance.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Labour Party's suggestion for an Irish forum on the future of Europe and hope whatever Government is in power in the next few years will adopt this idea. The concept is borrowed from the success of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation established by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. That forum was established against many people's thinking, but Deputy Reynolds saw it as being necessary. Those of us who participated in the forum will acknowledge that it was critical to the integration of Sinn Féin into the political process. That integration was long overdue, but has still to be completed.</P>
    <P>The forum we propose would comprise Members of the Oireachtas and have an indepen<Col N="1335" /> dent secretariat and chairperson. It would also comprise representatives of civic society and be able to receive submissions from groups concerned about this issue. The forum could discuss Ireland's interests in Europe, but also the shape Europe should take. It would hear the views of prospective and existing member states in an ongoing debate and help to shape the kind of Europe we require.</P>
    <P>The one country-one Commissioner proposal will be triggered when the Union membership exceeds 27 member states. However, what is unclear in every European capital and political family is the constitutional nature and shape of a Europe of 33 or 34 countries. I hope countries such as Serbia and Croatia will, in time, be part of such a Union.</P>
    <P>The eastern boundaries of the Union are fairly well defined by the Ukraine, Moldova and Russia. The Union will ultimately have 33 or 34 member states if one includes Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. We need to begin to shape the constitutional debate and open many of the procedures which are clouded in secrecy. Members will recall the nonsense of not opening Council meetings to the media which would result in a more honest reflection of what takes place at such meetings than the spinning by Ministers from different countries who rush out to their own media to put their spin on a particular story. Much of the suspicion at grassroots level is because the operations of the Commission and the Council seem remote and are clouded in a mysticism and jargon which alienate ordinary people.</P>
    <P>In voting for the Nice treaty we should prepare for the next intergovernmental conference. That conference should have a positive input from the Irish people, not just Irish political parties. Neither should it be remote as we have, sadly, seen in the conduct of negotiations for the last intergovernmental conference. The way to approach the issue is to structure and resource the debate and take our time.</P>
    <P>The new Europe will last for many decades. Ireland has a contribution to make to that process, not just because of our recent economic success which is what most applicant countries come here to see. We were impoverished and endured economic crises for a long time after 1973. We only began to get the economy right from the mid-1980s. That process was painful and difficult and membership of the European Union was no guarantee of economic success.</P>
    <P>There are other components to success such as our education system, our civic society and the rule of law. While from time to time we have had difficulties which required the establishment of tribunals to identify and eradicate problems, all these components are as critical to success as mere economic performance. However, economic success is essential to provide the resources to implement many other measures.</P>
    <P>We have an historic obligation and an oppor<Col N="1336" /> tunity to help construct the kind of Europe which is required post-Nice. It is time for the Irish body politic and Irish civic society to stop being takers, in every sense of the word, from the European Union and to start to be pro-active in promoting ideas. I am not just talking about taking resources in the form of Structural Funds, but taking policy positions and reacting to them. We should not wait to see what others do, the standard position of successive Governments, some of which I have been a member. We kept our heads down and were quiet, except where our own interests were directly affected. We would, therefore, be seen to be good Europeans and to maximise our draw down of whatever was on the table. That day is over. I have said to the socialist group in the European Parliament that Ireland will be a net contributor to the European budget within a number of years. I look forward to that day because the day we are a net contributor is the day this country will have achieved a level of economic prosperity, measured albeit inadequately on a <i>per capita</i> income base, which seemed a remote possibility ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>We should mentally change gear and start to think with the sort of constitutional genius which helped evolve the Good Friday Agreement. We should use the kind of skill for political negotiation and counter-balancing which characterised so many different kinds of Irish activities. We should use a forum like the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the New Ireland Forum to engage not just a small group of political people who are interested in the subject, but to invite the Irish Sovereignty Movement and other groups opposed to further integration to articulate alternatives and explain how they would function. We should engage people in that way with the resources we have witnessed in Dublin Castle and then send whatever Government is in office to the negotiations which will conclude in 2004 armed with a view which is not just reflective of the corridors of Iveagh House or Leinster House, but which has been informed by public participation at a level without parallel in civic society in the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>If those of us who wish to see this treaty substantially endorsed by the people are honest with ourselves, we will recognise that the Government made a major concession with regard to the Commissioner. This issue has not been adequately explained. Most do not realise that the intergovernmental conference of 2004 will replace the phrase &ldquo;an ever closer Union&rdquo; in the Treaty of Rome with the final destination for the nations of Europe. We have to contribute to that debate in a constructive and positive way. I urge the Minister to consider the Labour Party's proposal and ascertain if he can obtain Government support for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak in support of the Bill. I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign <Col N="1337" /> Affairs on the manner in which they negotiated the treaty. They returned from the summit with many important provisions. This is the case with regard to taxation about which many were concerned.</P>
      <P>There are questions regarding the Commission, but the proposals are fair considering the future size of the Union. It is quite an achievement that the make-up of the Commission will be on the basis of equality and rotation. Maybe we did not get exactly what everybody might have wanted, but I think we got a fair deal. In any negotiations into which people go, we have to negotiate not only something that is in our best interests in the long-term but something that is fair for the Union at large.</P>
      <P>Another area that was well negotiated was the voting weight. Ireland's voting weight is only marginally affected and remains the same as that of Finland and Denmark. It is important to note that most decisions of the Union are taken by consensus and, in practice, issues rarely divide on a big state-small state basis.</P>
      <P>The issue most people will discuss and debate is enlargement. As a small nation, we have much to give and to gain from the enlargement of the European Union. There is a great opportunity there for this country in negotiating and trading with small nations. If one looks at the amount of money Irish companies are putting into countries like Poland, and other small former eastern bloc states, one will see that our trade and the friendship that is there will help this country. There is hardly a country in Europe better positioned to take full advantage of enlargement than this one.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn said, people from many countries are coming here to look at what we have done and to see how we have developed our economy and this country over the years. We have the know-how on how to turn a small economy into a modern successful economic entity because many aspects of our economy were underdeveloped. We should remember that and that many countries are interested in us. It was brought home very clearly to me when I was asked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go to the Organisation of American States when we were canvassing for the seat on the Security Council. I met people from approximately 14 countries when I was there. Once we had asked them for their vote and discussed it with them, the people from every country, without exception, wanted to know how we developed our economy. Everyone of them wanted to come to Ireland to see how it was done. It is an enormous compliment to us that people view us as a small nation that has developed its economy in a very positive way. That is one of the reasons we were elected to the Security Council and why many countries which I hope will be members of an expanded European Union will see us as a positive ally in supporting them, whether at European Union level or in developing their economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of the Nice Treaty, and the further strengthening of relations with our European <Col N="1338" /> neighbours, which the treaty entails, I would like to make a few brief comments on some of the achievements and benefits which have accrued to Ireland as a direct result of our membership of the EU through the provision of EU funding to the tourism and local development sectors.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that EU Structural and Cohesion Funds have been one of the contributing factors to Ireland's economic growth in recent years and the financial support provided by the funds has contributed enormously to tourism growth, particularly through the operational programme for tourism, and to local development and the empowerment of disadvantaged communities through the operational programme for local, urban and rural development.</P>
    <P>The substantial commitment of the EU Commission to tourism development through various programmes in the period 1989-93 alone has supported investment of £450 million to tourist facilities, training and marketing in Ireland. The bulk of this investment, amounting to £380 million, has been supported through the operational programme for tourism where strategic emphasis was placed on developing new and improved product base, including weather independent facilities and expanded and more focused marketing and training. Notwithstanding the success of that operational programme, there are still many product gaps which needed to be filled and further investment required in these and other areas if tourism was to continue to develop successfully. Consequently, the principal objective of the tourism strategy in later years was to maximise Ireland's tourism potential by increasing tourism revenue and creating much needed employment.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 involved a total investment of £720 million of which £373 million came from the EU across a number of subprogrammes, including product development, marketing and training. The principal objective of the tourism strategy over the period was to achieve a foreign earnings target of £2.250 million per annum by 1999, the creation of 29,000 full-time tourism related jobs equivalent in the economy, including 17,250 in direct tourism and 11,750 in indirect and induced employment, and concentrated a significant proportion of growth in the shoulder and off peak periods such that by 1999, 75% of all visitors would arrive in Ireland outside the peak period.</P>
    <P>Such has been the rate of growth of Irish tourism that the first two or three main targets have been surpassed ahead of programme end. In 1999, foreign exchange earnings reached an estimated £2.5 billion and 135,000 full-time jobs were supported by the tourism industry. A reduction to 27% in the proportion of visitors arriving at peak times was achieved. However, the growth in off peak and shoulder season has increased by almost three times the growth in peak season, representing considerable movement in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The substantial commitment of the EU through the various programmes has resulted in <Col N="1339" /> much needed investment in infrastructure and facilities enabling the Irish tourism sector to expand and position itself strongly for further growth. Clearly, the benefits of tourism are to be seen everywhere in Ireland. New and improved facilities which have been developed to the highest international standard are enjoyed not only by visitors, but by all our people while revenue spend makes a positive contribution to the quality of life of every community in the country.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for local, urban and rural development, more than £200 million was allocated by the EU to bring about social, economic and environmental development at a local level with special emphasis on disadvantaged communities. Under the subprogramme for the integrated development of designated, disadvantaged and other areas, there has been a significant investment of £115 million aimed at empowering communities in the most disadvantaged areas of the country to participate fully in tackling the social and economic problems which face them. The programme has supported local development plans through which communities, particularly in disadvantaged areas, have sponsored innovative projects for enterprise creation and development, education and training, environmental and infrastructure improvements and capacity buildings.</P>
    <P>The process has also created a unique forum where the different interests of the local community, the State sector, employers and trade unions are combined to address the priority needs of an area. ADM has provided extensive support for the partnership and community groups over the course of the programme. Through the use of seminars and workshops, ADM has gone a long way to disseminating the best practice and work methods for the development of communities all over the country. In fact, it is being looked at by other countries as a good model in which to deliver at local level.</P>
    <P>The process has contributed enormously to strengthening the local community infrastructure in the areas of greatest need. Specifically, the programme has achieved the following. More than 5,000 previously unemployed people were placed in employment in 1999 alone bringing the total number of direct job placements by partnerships and community groups to over 19,000 to date. Some 4,260 long-term unemployed people set up their own businesses with partnership and community groups' assistance in 1999.</P>

      <P>I will conclude. A total of 17,000 business start-ups have been supported in the subprogramme.</P>
      <P>Another EU funded programme which falls under my remit is URBAN. The URBAN programme, initiated by the European Union, is being implemented in more than 80 European cities. The aim of the programme is to act as a catalyst, providing community assistance to support integrated action plans covering economic development, social integration and environmental measures designed to improve living conditions.</P>
      <P>Our full and active participation at the heart of Europe has been essentially in accessing financial support from the European Commission for innovative programmes such as URBAN and the local development operational programme. The modernisation of our tourism industry has been largely brought about through the success of the EU-funded operational programme for tourism.</P>
      <P>It is important that the treaty is supported. Ireland has a great deal to offer and to gain from an enlarged Europe. People will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when they consider the benefits that have accrued to Ireland and will accrue when the treaty is in place. When they examine the future of Europe they will believe the EU will bring us more success than it has in the past. Ireland can bring a great deal to the EU as it has over the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nice Treaty marks another step in the evolution of European integration and <Col N="1341" /> the pursuit of the core objective of the original Treaty of Rome, which was ever closer union among the peoples of Europe. In spite of the right's much exaggerated commentary marking the Nice Treaty as a reassertion of the rights of the nation state, it should not be forgotten that the core objective of the Treaty of Rome has not changed.</P>
      <P>The Nice Treaty is much more than the Amsterdam Treaty for different reasons. EU institutional instruments that have been on the table since the fall of the Berlin Wall have been resolved to the relative satisfaction of all countries and the significance of that achievement should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>EU applicant and pre-applicant countries are satisfied with the outcome of the Nice Treaty. I have met representatives of most applicant countries in Ireland or on their own territory. They are looking forward to becoming full members of the EU. Earlier Deputies Durkan, Hogan and I met the Hungarian Foreign Minister and his delegation. Last week we met representatives of the Czech Republic and Estonia and we also recently met officials from Slovenia. Tomorrow Polish officials will be in Dublin. We should not underestimate the efforts of these countries to comply with the<i> acquis communautaire.</i> The demands have been rigorous and not without pain. These countries also have Euro-sceptics but nonetheless on balance they believe their future lies in an enlarged Union.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that we should ensure the two global conflicts of the 20th century and the ensuing ideological confrontation are not repeated. There is no doubt, as the Minister of State said, there will be major trade opportunities for Ireland, but the treaty has three main advantages which are to enhance peace, ensure greater stability and provide greater opportunities through an increased market.</P>
      <P>The common foreign and security policy will be raised by those in opposition to the Nice Treaty, particularly the development of the rapid reaction force. Under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, participation in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by national Governments. Each Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit troops or resources. The development of the rapid reaction force must be seen against the background of the situation in Europe, which has altered greatly over the past ten years since the end of the Cold War.</P>
      <P>New patterns of security co-operation involving former adversaries and European states have emerged and are continuing to evolve. The rapid reaction force will be in a position to act as the regional arm of the UN peacekeeping service and, therefore, Ireland's involvement in these circumstances will constitute continuation in the European region of our existing EU peacekeeping duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of whether participation in the rapid reaction force will affect our long-standing neu<Col N="1342" /> trality will be raised. I believe it will not affect our neutrality. Ireland undertook an even greater commitment when joining the UN. Ireland has contributed to UN peacekeeping missions since 1959 and is proud of its participation in these endeavours. Irish participation in the rapid reaction force emphasises co-operation, not confrontation, a value at the heart of foreign policy since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Participation by the Defence Forces in the rapid reaction force will arise only in clearly defined circumstances, namely, when UN authorisation is in place and when the terms of the relevant domestic legislation have been met. Ireland's commitment to the rapid reaction force is, therefore, fully in keeping with its approach to peacekeeping and is consistent with its foreign policy traditions. Both the UN and EU emphasise the importance of enhancing capabilities and response times in crisis management of UN operations and the development of effective command structures. Both recognise the increased complexity of such operations and are trying to ensure peacekeeping tasks can be carried out more effectively.</P>
    <P>The UN has increased its reliance on regional security organisations to support and carry out missions on its behalf. There is a growing emphasis on the responsibility of regional organisations for peacekeeping in partnership with the UN. The EU with its rapid reaction force will meet this need and is identifying capabilities in many respects similar to what has been happening at another level at the UN through its standby arrangements system in which Ireland already participates. For instance, in Kosovo and East Timor, contributing countries to similar arrangements have been able to act under the mandate of the UN. The EU, with its broad membership and close relationships with neighbouring countries, is developing its crisis management role in this context.</P>
    <P>I will strongly support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum and I am hopeful the public will recognise the value of Ireland's interest in being part of a larger, peaceful and stable Europe and having access to a larger market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party will urge a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Nice Treaty referendum. We regard the treaty as a further attack on democracy, which moves decision making further away from the Irish people into the hands of bureaucrats, Ministers and lobbyists.</P>
      <P>We now have less democracy and accountability. Ireland has lost its veto in over 30 new areas, its right to a Commissioner, its voting strength in the crucial Council of Ministers and three of its 15 MEPs. This is not, as the Government is trying to sell it, a treaty about enlargement. Enlargement is a small part of it, a part which has been badly handled. Nice is more about deepening the EU, not widening it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in voting strengths and the loss of MEPs will take place from 2005, regardless of <Col N="1343" /> enlargement. The reason the people are being given a chance to vote in a referendum is the significance of these changes. Losing the veto in a number of areas, particularly the new provisions on enhanced co-operation which is the vehicle for producing a two tier Europe and an EU of unequal states rather than the partnership of equals Ireland originally joined, represents a profound shift in our relationship with the European Union.</P>
    <P>The other area I wish to address is Irish neutrality, a neutrality that this Government, like no other, has managed to dismantle with incredible deception and thoroughness through the Amsterdam Treaty, NATO's Partnership for Peace, the rapid reaction force and the Nice Treaty. It is incredible that the Ministers, Deputies Cowen and Michael Smith, and the Taoiseach can even speak the words &ldquo;Irish neutrality&rdquo; with a straight face.</P>
    <P>First, I will discuss the issue of democracy. It is amazing how the Members of this House can so blithely vote away their powers in EU treaty after treaty with hardly a murmur. The big parties sing in unison on this issue. The House will soon have the powers of a county council, as I pointed out recently to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and we know from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey's, latest waste regulations the type of weak powers county councils will soon have.</P>
    <P>Why are the Labour Party and Fine Gael supporting this treaty? Both strenuously attacked the treaty last December in this House. The then Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Bruton, said Nice was one of the weakest negotiating outcomes achieved by an Irish Government. He attacked the loss of our Commissioner and the shift of voting strength to the large states. Deputy O'Keeffe said Nice had been achieved at considerable cost to this country. Deputy Quinn is not a Euro-sceptic &ndash; his idea for a European forum is excellent &ndash; but he said in December that Nice was a disaster and a travesty. He said the rainbow coalition would never have accepted it and that when the history of the Nice Treaty is written it would be seen as &ldquo;the point at which the spirit of the founding fathers was neutered&rdquo;. I could not agree more with the latter sentiment. The same parties now come to the Dáil to advocate a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. This is astonishing. Will they accept anything that is thrown at them?</P>
    <P>Not only must we be vigilant about lack of democracy in terms of the EU but also about democracy in this Chamber. It is most undemocratic that we are debating the Nice Treaty today when a copy of the treaty, a complex document, was available to Deputies only at the end of last week. The Nice Treaty does not have to be ratified until the end of 2002 yet the Government is rushing, in the midst of a foot and mouth crisis, to hold a referendum by the end of May, with three unrelated referenda attached. Why the unseemly haste? Will the Referendum Com<Col N="1344" /> mission be ready? Will it produce a booklet, as it did on the last occasion, or will we simply have what the Department refers to as a neutral document, a condensed White Paper? The White Paper, on close reading, is about as neutral as this country. The Government must be confident of the numbers in the Supreme Court if it is willing to push the White Paper because, as far as I am concerned, it is extremely dodgy in light of the McKenna judgment.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the specific provisions of the Nice Treaty and its assault on democracy. Due to the removal of the veto in over 30 new areas, nearly 90% of EU laws &ndash; these laws are made behind closed doors &ndash; can now be passed by majority vote with no veto available to Ireland if it disagrees. In many cases there is also no input from the European Parliament. The shift in voting strengths in the Council of Ministers was a numerical shift in favour of the big states over the small. From 2005, regardless of whether there are new EU states, two large and one medium state can block EU decisions. In an enlarged EU of 27 states, three large states can block decisions if one of the states is Germany. The shift from veto to qualified majority voting has left a blocking veto in the hands of a few large states.</P>
    <P>The shift to qualified majority voting also means Ireland's strength in the Commission is weakened. Not only do we lose our Commissioner to a rotating system when the EU has 27 members but from 2005, under Article 214, the President of the Commission is to be chosen by qualified majority voting, as are all the Commissioners. This means the Irish Government's preferred choice need not be accepted. It also gives the President of the Commission more powers and sows the seeds for an office of European prime minister and a European Government assisted by a cabinet.</P>
    <P>Provisions on enhanced co-operation are another example of the push towards a European state, further integration and a weakening of Irish democracy. Further integration is an issue about which even prominent members of the Government have raised concerns. The EU's response to the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was a forewarning of things to come. Already, democratic control over Ireland's economic policy is seriously constrained by European economic guidelines and our commitments in the euro zone. Enhanced co-operation is one of the reasons the Attorney General judged that a referendum was required on the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>There were enhanced co-operation provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty but they could be operated only by unanimity. The Nice Treaty extends enhanced co-operation across all three pillars and allows it to operate under qualified majority voting. Nice should be called the treaty of enhanced co-operation, not the treaty of enlargement. This is a dangerous and fundamental departure from an EU of equals to one of first and second class membership, of elites and common members. <Col N="1345" /> Former Commission President, Jacques Delors, stated last June that it would be necessary to create an <i>avant-garde.</i> He said there could be a union of the enlarged Europe and a federation for the <i>avant-garde.</i> Last May, the German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, called for a European federation.</P>
    <P>Eight countries can decide to become an <i>avant-garde</i> and push ahead on further integration, leaving the rest behind. Even in an EU of 27 states, eight states can proceed. Schengen and the euro zone, although not technically enhanced co-operation, are similar but were formed under unanimity arrangements. Everybody had to agree. With qualified majority voting joint arrangements can be rammed through and the Nice Treaty provides detailed provisions for how this will work.</P>
    <P>Enhanced co-operation is also a peculiar gift to present to the applicant states and a funny way to welcome them to the enlarged EU. Once they manage to get the rules right, at great sacrifice, for entry to the club, they will get to the front door only to discover there is yet another very important club within the club. Qualified majority voting has also been extended to create problems for democratic accountability, with Ireland's veto removed in such areas as Structural and Cohesion Funds, some areas of common foreign and security policy, some justice issues, the selection of key posts, such as the high representative position currently held by Javier Solana, and aspects of international trade agreements.</P>
    <P>Removing the veto and shifting to qualified majority voting in EU international trade provisions under Article 133 will strengthen the hand of lobbyists of transnational corporations and the EU Trade Commissioner to push through the agenda for a new trade round and more deregulation. It will enable negotiations to be fast tracked with no troublesome democrats overseeing them. Negotiations and agreements on trade in services and the commercial aspects of intellectual property are, in the Nice Treaty, subject to qualified majority voting. Does this mean, for example, the French veto on the damaging multilateral agreement on investment, MAI, could no longer happen?</P>
    <P>More trade decisions will pass out of national and democratic control. The Dáil has the power to ratify international trade agreements. I believe this will be removed and I ask the Minister to confirm this view. Such provisions are not only an attack on democracy but also a spur to the headlong rush towards globalisation.</P>
    <P>One must wade through a great deal of this so called enlargement treaty before one reaches the protocol on enlargement. It addresses new voting allocations in the Parliament and the Council of Ministers and new arrangements in the Commission. However, it addresses little else. It does not address the real problems of enlargement. The new voting strengths come into operation in 2005 regardless of enlargement. The switch to increased qualified majority voting means even <Col N="1346" /> more legislation and rules for the applicant countries to take on board and comply with, on top of the 26,000 EU documents with which they are already struggling. A new approach is needed to ease the way for new applicants rather than put additional obstacles in their way. Can the EU not develop an alternative path for membership which puts people, not the market, centre stage?</P>
    <P>Adjustments to a market economy and the slashing of public expenditure are causing great hardship in these countries. Caroline Lucas, the British Green Party MEP, has written a report, One Year after Seattle, on this process. She gives the example of Slovakia, where public transport has been sacrificed for more road building and forest conservation has been compromised for timber exports. In Poland, two million farmers, most of them organic, will have to adjust to the CAP, cheap food exports and intensive farming practices. Privatisation has allowed global car giants to take over domestic car production in central and eastern Europe, often involving huge tax breaks at the expense of the wider economy. As Caroline Lucas puts it so well: </P>
    <P>The choice is clear. Either we have an EU which sees itself as nothing more than a giant supermarket of potentially 500 million consumers or we adopt a bolder, more ambitious vision of a Europe of genuine stability and co-operation based on the rebuilding of sustainable local economies, both east and west and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>These are the sorts of issues with which a real treaty of enlargement should be concerned and not merely readjustments in voting strengths, which in any case go ahead independently of accession by any State. Perhaps the next treaty, envisaged in 2004, will be truly about enlargement. The Nice Treaty is not and it is total salesmanship by the Government to sell it as such. There should be a consumer warning in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The main area the Government will be keen to downplay will be defence-military implications and neutrality. I am the first to admit that the Amsterdam Treaty had more changes in the defence field than the Nice Treaty and the Green Party argued strenuously against those significant changes in the last referendum. The Government argued at the time that nothing really significant in Amsterdam was happening but that was totally misleading as the new 60,000-strong rapid reaction force shows us. However, significant changes occur in the Nice Treaty also.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government put its cards on the table regarding Irish neutrality. As I said, while it repeats the mantra of preserving Ireland's long-standing neutrality, it has overseen a thorough dismantling of that neutrality. We have been given a bum deal by the Government. How can it claim we are neutral? The other so-called EU neutrals are being told otherwise by their Governments. Perhaps the Minister can explain why Finland no longer says it is neutral but that <Col N="1347" /> it is non-aligned. Why does Sweden say it is no longer neutral but is non-aligned? When I met members of an Austrian delegation recently they said the only reason they are saying they are neutral is their 1955 agreement with the Soviet Union. Why does NATO refer to these countries as the former neutrals? I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it refer to us as a former neutral?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It is calling us former neutrals.</P>
      <P>Maastricht recognised the nuclear military alliance, the Western European Union, as being integral to the development of the EU's common foreign and security policy. Article J4 of the Amsterdam Treaty stated that the Western European Union would provide the EU with access to an operational capability and that it supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the common foreign and security policy. Now the Western European Union has all but disappeared in the Nice Treaty. Why? Because virtually all its functions, that of the military alliance, have been taken in by the European Union.</P>
      <P>Article 1.2 of the Nice Treaty sweeps away references to the Western European Union and thereby directly integrates defence into the European Union. The Western European Union has become redundant. The exception is the Western European Union's mutual defence clause, which is the last straw the Government is clinging to to prove Ireland is neutral. That is all the Government is doing &ndash; clutching at straws. Article 1.5 of the Nice Treaty establishes a new EU institution, the political and security committee, which will exercise the political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations. It will in effect direct military interventions during a crisis, including the waging of war. Deputy John Bruton has stated during Taoiseach's Question Time that the Petersberg Tasks are about waging war.</P>
      <P>How many Deputies have seen a copy of the annexes of the Presidency report, which I have here? It is referred to in the first declaration attached to the Nice Treaty but I doubt if many Members have seen it, given how difficult it was to get copies of the treaty in the first place. How many Members realise this runs to 33 pages, with seven annexes detailing the new EU military capabilities, the working of the political and security committee, the EU military committee, the EU military staff organisation and, in annex 7, detailed standing arrangements for consultation and co-operation between the EU and NATO? How many Members realise this includes the possibility of the command of an EU operation being put into the hands of NATO? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Nice Treaty is passed, all this, the political and security committee, the military structures and policies, will become part of the Irish Consti<Col N="1348" /> tution. That is an appalling development. We have been continuously misled. Nobody who voted for the Amsterdam Treaty thought they were voting for a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force. The Government now says this force was foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty but it is funny how we did not hear anything about it at the time. Any time the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign mentioned such a prospect we were dismissed as alarmist but these developments should alarm us. When is the Government going to come clean on this issue? It has sold out big time on neutrality.</P>
    <P>We now have a rapid reaction force and the Government refuses to call it an army, though we are familiar with the famous Romano Prodi quote, that if one does not want to call it a European army one can call it what one likes &ndash; one can call it Mary Ann or Margaret but of course it is still an army as far as he is concerned. Ireland has committed troops and military equipment to a 60,000-strong EU force capable of intervening 4,000 km from Brussels, which brings in parts of Russia, the Middle East and Africa. That force will have the full range of military options up to and including war. There is a unified command, permanent military structures, interoperability and joint training. That sounds like an army to me but perhaps not to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government not insert a protocol in the treaty similar to the Danish protocol which exempts the Danes from EU policies with military and defence implications? Why has the Government not been up front about the fact that the new rapid reaction force does not see itself as requiring a UN mandate? The Government may assure the House that it has made it clear to the EU that Ireland will participate only under a UN mandate but why did we agree to participate and co-operate in a military force which is willing to undermine the UN and flaunt the UN mandate? This is completely contrary to the long-standing policy of this country, a policy strongly supported by the people. Our troops should serve the UN only under strict UN mandates. Why did the Government not insert that position in a protocol to the Nice Treaty? </P>
    <P>The Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs will no doubt reiterate that there is Irish legislation stating that Irish troops may go abroad only under a UN mandate. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will know that there has been a debate about the legal interpretation of that legislation. The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960, states that Irish troops can serve abroad only &ldquo;with a force or body established by the UN Security Council or General Assembly&rdquo;. A rapid reaction force has been established by the EU, not the UN, a point made also by Deputy Michael Higgins. In terms of Irish law, this rapid reaction force project is probably illegal but EU law supersedes Irish law, which is the fundamental point.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that if the EU rapid reaction force decided to head for Macedonia and Russia objected in the Security Council that we would go back to our European <Col N="1349" /> colleagues and say we could not go? This was raised in the Joint Committee on European Affairs by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and the Minister's answer was inadequate. The Defence Estimates for this year are already 20% above last year's, mainly because of capital expenditure on new weapons programmes. We are now committed to hundreds of millions of pounds in the next decade thanks to our new EU defence role.</P>
    <P>This is a tragic waste though one with which arms manufacturers will be delighted. I am not sure whether the Irish electorate will be too delighted. The Green Party and I believe this money should be spent on health, education, housing and the environment. It is obscene to spend money this way and that is why this treaty will be rejected.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the restrictions and regulations imposed as a result of the current foot and mouth disease emergency, calls on the Government to establish a special task force to work in conjunction with an appropriate economic sub-committee of Cabinet, the role and function of which shall be to carry out an immediate economic impact assessment of the devastating effects to the economy and business as a consequence of foot and mouth disease with particular reference to the agri-food sector, food processing, transport and haulage, tourism, sporting and all outdoor pursuits, entertainment, leisure, bookmaking, hotel/restaurant, catering industry and many employment sectors throughout the economy where already hundreds of lay-offs have occurred and where thousands of job losses are threatened resulting in hardship and trauma for thousands of families and further calls on the Government to complete such an assessment without delay with a view towards introducing an appropriate range of measures and reliefs in the form of an aid package to mitigate the loss and damage involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A disturbing report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today refers to the movement of livestock in the exclusion zones on both sides of the Border. It appears not to be isolated but substantial in nature. Everybody knows that the movement of animals, especially sheep, is the principal <Col N="1350" /> means by which the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease is spread. Those who move animals within the exclusion zone are criminally negligent and show wanton disregard for their neighbours. They put their own selfish interests before the national interest and they must not be allowed to ride a coach and four through the rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>When the slaughter policy in the Cooley peninsula is complete it is essential that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development checks the number of sheep slaughtered in each farm against headage payments claimed by the farmers. It is imperative that the Department's compensation scheme for slaughtered animals does not provide the dishonest few with another opportunity of unlawful gain. The total number slaughtered must correspond with the total number paid for.</P>
      <P>While the efforts so far in combating the spread of the disease are laudable the same cannot be said for the contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation or the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment when dealing with the economic consequences of the current restrictions. Widespread reports of lay-offs, job threats, shortage of cash and a general economic down turn have shown real and serious collateral damage over a range of enterprises and businesses, resulting in individual family hardship for thousands of citizens.</P>
      <P>The State should prepare an appropriate plan to deal with the adverse economic fall-out, which is neither exclusively agriculture or tourism in nature. The crisis permeates a huge range of economic and business activity and cannot be understated. It was natural and understandable that when it began the Government should have erred on the side of caution as regards restrictions. Now that we understand more clearly how the disease is spread we need to target the message more carefully.</P>
      <P>The Government is giving contradictory signals. On the one hand, its advertising campaigns advise people not to visit the countryside while on the other hand, it declares that the countryside is open for tourism business. There needs to be a scheduling of restrictions and regulations that will first and foremost allow a proper balance to be achieved between reducing the risk of spreading the disease and jeopardising jobs and normal economic activity.</P>
      <P>The problem to date is threefold. First, the cancellations of events, including St. Patrick's Day festivities, conferences, meetings and festivals; second, the closure of facilities, including parks, tourist houses and hill walks and, third, adverse publicity throughout the world, especially in the US. We need to know what is open for the forthcoming Easter holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government needs to identify and quantify the extent of the problem. It can only do so by setting in place an appropriate economic sub-committee of the Cabinet and a further commit<Col N="1351" /> tee involving appropriate agencies to work alongside it. We urgently need an economic impact assessment of the crisis. I have called previously for an interdepartmental group to quantify the economic impact of the disease. Specific sectors, such as animal transport, haulage, livestock marts &ndash; where, already, 2,000 jobs are threatened &ndash; horse racing and other sporting activities and outdoor pursuits have come to a standstill. Tourism, especially rural tourism, has been dealt a body blow. It is estimated that up to £500 million may be lost to that industry.</P>
    <P>We are hearing tales of hardship every day involving businesses and people. Thousands of businesses have suffered a major drop in income. Small businesses involved in rural tourism are under severe pressure. Curtailing foot and mouth disease and preventing it spreading is in the national interests but it is not adequate that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should be so dismissive of any relief measures for those most directly affected. Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Government to devise a range of relief measures for those suffering most.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider a menu of reliefs, including certain rebates on PAYE, PRSI and VAT; an initiative to ensure sympathetic consideration by banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners; a rebate of local authority rates on businesses worst affected; the possibility of an extra public holiday later in the year when people might be encouraged to visit the countryside and a vigorous diplomatic and marketing programme in the twin areas of tourism and the food export business loudly proclaiming that Ireland is open and safe. To combat the negative impact the disease is having on the perception of Ireland and Irish food overseas we need an imaginative and well funded promotional and marketing campaign focusing on the quality of Irish food and the Irish tourism product. This campaign should be supported by a well directed and vigorous effort by every Irish embassy.</P>
    <P>When the present crisis is over we urgently need a cost benefit analysis of the agricultural policies pursued by the State. It should be clear to all that bigger is not necessarily better. The industrial style farming and processing methods, supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and significant elements of the farming community, have had a serious impact on animal welfare and food safety in addition to having devastating economic consequences when things go wrong. The collection of animals in large number and transporting them long distances in stressful conditions is a recipe for spreading disease and undermines the quality of the final product. Livestock marts should give serious consideration to developing a fair market in livestock without collection in mart premises. Modern technology may end the necessity for collecting animals in central locations, such as marts, to create a market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Local craft butchers should be supported and a financial package put in place to allow smaller local abattoirs meet EU hygiene regulations. Fianna Fáil promised this in its general election manifesto but, again, it has failed to deliver. Abattoirs have been shut down and jobs have been lost as the local butcher in many towns has disappeared.</P>
    <P>Given the close link between tourism and agriculture, rural tourist pursuits are facing a spring and summer of devastation beyond the control of the proprietors. What is needed first and foremost is identification and quantification followed by Government action to aid and assist the thousands of small and medium sized businesses in every parish suffering trauma, financial loss and damage due to this crisis. I urge the House to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> This year was to have been the best ever tourism season. The myriad of attractions the country so assiduously built up over the years had been aggressively marketed and sold abroad. Bookings and inquiries were up, indications from overseas trade fairs were never better and the market was due to grow by 5%. What was to have been a dream year is now turning out to be a nightmare.</P>
      <P>Tourism is taking a terrible hit from the foot and mouth crisis. Tourism interests are hurting badly. Instead of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations kick-starting the season, all parades were called off and hotels, guesthouses and tour buses lay empty and idle. Matters have not improved. Deposits have been returned, flights and sailings have been cancelled and a sense of gloom and despair hangs over an industry which each year brings in 6.3 million foreign visitors and earns more than £4 billion for the economy.</P>
      <P>While the tourism industry has more than willingly co-operated with the national campaign to keep foot and mouth disease out of the country, there is an understandable feeling in the industry that its contribution is not appreciated or recognised in tangible terms. The point can rightly be made that if a farm animal cannot be sold today or this week it can be sold tomorrow or next week. By contrast, the revenue from an empty hotel room tonight cannot be recouped next week or next year. The further point is made that if a farmer has to slaughter an animal under the foot and mouth disease cull scheme he is rightly generously compensated. However, if a coach operator, airline or car ferry operator is left with empty seats because of the crisis there is no compensation or concession. It is a perishable commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we must do everything possible, within reason, to protect the agricultural sector, to keep the dreaded scourge of foot and mouth disease out of the country and to ensure that the British catastrophe is not visited here. We must also introduce a sense of balance in our approach. Approximately 150,000 people are employed in the tourism industry, far more than in agriculture. <Col N="1353" /> Bord Fáilte has approximately 850 hotels, comprising 40,000 rooms, and 488 guesthouses on its books. Just under 70% of hotels and guesthouses are small, family run enterprises with less than 50 bedrooms. More than 57,000 are employed in hotels and a further 3,260 in guesthouses. More than 90% of the jobs are permanent.</P>
    <P>Tourism interests are angered by the confusion in Government circles regarding the conflicting messages issued by Ministers and their Departments. The Irish Cottage Holiday Homes Association telephoned the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and was told that visitors from the UK are being encouraged to visit Ireland as long as they do not come from infected areas. When the association telephoned the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development it was told that tourists from Britain were not being encouraged to visit. Could one find a greater deterrent than the advertisement inserted in the <i>Irish Post</i> by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which advised intending visitors to Ireland to &ldquo;Postpone your visit to Ireland unless absolutely necessary&rdquo;? Britain is Ireland's most important tourism market. Last year the number of British tourists soared to 3.5 million while tourist revenue totalled £900 million. One million of those who came here were native Irish people returning home to holiday. Intending visitors from this huge market, on which we depend to such a considerable degree, have now been told by a Department to &ldquo;Stay away &ndash; we don't want you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I listened to a Chicago based Irish person on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week. The message he wanted to convey could not have been clearer: the American perception is that Ireland is not a safe place in which to holiday this year. I am afraid that the Government and Bord Fáilte have failed to get the message across that this image of Ireland is wrong; that far from having a virulent health problem, Ireland is open to tourists, inviting and welcoming tourists and one of the safest places to holiday this year.</P>
    <P>Recently the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation heard submissions from Bord Fáilte, the Irish Hotels Federation, Town and Country Homes Association, Irish Caravan Council, Irish Cottage Holiday Homes Association, Restaurants Association of Ireland, Irish Farm Holidays Association, Coach Tourism and Transport Council, Irish Tour Operators Association and Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. Throughout the entire industry there is despair, gloom and pessimism. Bord Fáilte and the ITIC estimate the loss to date at £174 million. Bord Fáilte projects a possible loss of £500 million and 20,000 jobs between March and August. This is understated. Unless a very successful counter-offensive and salvage operation are launched, the losses will be substantially greater in terms of jobs and revenue.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation estimated that between 1 and 22 March £33 million worth of <Col N="1354" /> business had been cancelled in the form of up to 3,000 conferences, meetings and social events. The Town and Country Homes Association reported cancellations of bookings with its members throughout the country. The discouragement of golf and angling was having a devastating effect. The association's members were being affected by wholesale cancellations from the domestic market. In one week alone the number of bookings from the UK market dropped by 66% on the previous week.</P>
    <P>The Irish Caravan and Camping Council represents 140 parks accommodating in excess of 20,000 per night. Many of its parks are, by necessity, located near farms. It has virtually no home market on which to rely and depends almost entirely on visitors from Northern Ireland and Britain. In the council's own words, if restrictions are in place for the next six months, its segment of the industry &ldquo;will be wiped out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irish Farm House Holidays has 400 members dispersed throughout rural Ireland, all situated on family farms. On 21 March its head office in Limerick, which operates a central reservation system, handled three bookings from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Unless something dramatic happens, many, possibly most, cannot survive.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, a company already afflicted with ongoing industrial relations problems, suffered a £4 million drop in revenue for the first three weeks of March. Bookings were down 18% from UK regional airports and 10% on the London route.</P>
    <P>Irish Ferries is a major contributor to the success of Irish tourism. Last year it carried 1.8 million passengers, 400,000 cars and 9,400 coaches. Car tourism is critical to the tourist economy as it delivers longer stay holidaymakers; a regional spread of holidaymakers throughout the country, particularly in rural areas, and a higher yield and spend. The company's most important market is Britain. Out of the total of 3.5 million visitors to Ireland from Britain in 2000, 1.26 million or 36% travelled by sea. In the first three weeks of March bookings dropped by 30%. If this is sustained throughout the season, bookings will be wiped out. The story from the Coach and Tourism Council is much the same. All sectors are hurting badly.</P>
    <P>There is, as Deputy Flanagan stated, a problem. The mixed messages coming out of Ireland at Government level must stop. The message must go out loud and clear that Ireland is open for business. The problem must be tackled on two fronts. First, there must be an immediate effective marketing assault to try to salvage as much of the industry as possible. I welcome the fact that up to £15 million is to be spent on marketing. It is not a question of throwing money at advertisements. I am not in favour of all the money being allocated to Bord Fáilte. A considerable amount should be allocated to Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries which already have strong and successful marketing arms. Aer Lingus is a brand name with credibility in the United States and does a huge <Col N="1355" /> amount of solid promotional work right across America. Irish Ferries has successfully penetrated the UK market. These companies have the know how and the infrastructure. Advertisements by Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries with the clear message, &ldquo;You can travel. We can get you there safely.&rdquo;, would go a long way towards dispelling the current myth about Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is clear is that there will be substantial losses all around. What is equally clear is that many of those who have done the hard grafting and borrowed substantial amounts to put the tourist infrastructure in place cannot survive. It is inevitable that banks will demand repayments on borrowings. If cashflow is down, then repayments cannot be met. Apart from the personal calamity for those who will go out of business, there will be gaping holes in the market which will need to be filled at considerable cost.</P>
    <P>There should be a major focus on the domestic tourist market, a plea to Irish people to holiday at home this year and fill the vacant bed spaces. Fine Gael believes that the Government must immediately adopt a co-ordinated approach by establishing a special task force to make an urgent assessment of the economic consequences of the foot and mouth crisis and introduce a programme of measures to enable the different sectoral areas to ride out their current difficulties. From the point of view of the tourism industry, the Government should immediately call in the banks and ask them to facilitate hard pressed tourist interests with deferred payments and low interest rates on borrowings; examine the possibility of a rescue package to be worked out between the Government and the industry; examine the possibility of extending the excise rebate on fuel to the coach tour sector; examine the possibility of low interest loans; re-examine the existing restrictions on the movement of people to determine if they can be safely relaxed; request Bord Fáilte to waive its fees and charges on the different tourist sectors for the current year; and examine the possibility of local authorities waiving rates and other charges on tourist facilities and amenities for this year.</P>
    <P>As and from next week, the Minister should be aboard promoting Ireland on an ongoing basis. I note with considerable interest, for example, that the Scottish Tourism Board has already dispatched Sean Connery to the United States to send out the most positive message regarding the safety of Scotland as a holiday destination.</P>
    <P>When the foot and mouth crisis eases it will take time to rebuild the tourism industry to the successful level it had reached before the crisis. While short-term measures are extremely important at this juncture, there must also be put in place a market recovery promotional plan in order to address the ongoing and longer term problems and retrieve our share of a market which is vitally important to all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising <Col N="1356" /> this issue. Those involved in or dependent on tourism are in a deep and widespread crisis as a result of the foot and mouth situation. The potential scale of the crisis and its impact are of grave concern. The conflicting messages being sent by the Department do not help. The advertised blanket ban on travel, which states &ldquo;Do not travel to Britain&rdquo;, should state, &ldquo;Do not travel to high risk areas in Britain such as farms.&rdquo; Surely intending visitors from low risk areas in Britain such as cities to low risk areas in Ireland should not be discouraged as their loss to the tourism industry would be gigantic.</P>
      <P>Tourism brings over six million people to Ireland annually, generating £3 billion in foreign revenue. These figures say nothing about the impact of domestic tourism. Some 157,000 jobs are sustained by the tourism, hospitality and catering sectors. Some 57p in every tourism pound goes directly to the Exchequer. The Government coffers, therefore, are likely to be the biggest loser. Last year, receipts from tourism, excluding indirect spending, accounted for almost 5% of GDP.</P>
      <P>The collateral damage to the country's second industry has become a major national issue. Economic commentators have realised that what hurts tourism, hurts jobs. There is huge concern among those involved in the industry. Losses are being suffered across the board by airlines, ferries, hotels and bed and breakfast establishments from many of which the Minister heard directly at the meeting held last week. Car hire and coach companies which depend on home and overseas tour business have been affected. Boat hire companies, those who depend on angling and other field sports, and those who hire bikes or operate local tours are also affected. Due to the ripple effect, whole communities are being affected. Pubs, grocery shops, petrol stations and craft workers are also being affected. The list is almost endless. Businesses and jobs are at risk.</P>
      <P>A drop of £500 million in overseas revenue could translate into job losses of at least 15,000 to 20,000 throughout the country, which is a conservative estimate. Our advertising and promotional campaigns are normally at their peak at this time of the year and bookings should be rolling in, but not alone are bookings not been received in anything like the normal proportions in many sectors, they have dried up. Meetings, conferences and seminars are being called off, but why is the Minister not clarifying the position by stating that if people contact his office, they will be given direction? Conflicting messages are being given here not to mind in the UK. The situation has been very badly handled. Last week a choral festival in Cork was cancelled and now there is talk that the Rose of Tralee festival will be cancelled. If the Minister cannot give direction here, how can he do so in regard to the UK? While it was agreed that the St. Patrick's Day parade here should be cancelled, since then, events have been cancelled that should not have been cancelled. Why has that happened? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The Minister is talking about spending £20 million on a marketing campaign, but what is being spent on marketing tourism within the State and getting a clear direction on this issue? Many businesses will not recover from this. Unlike other material products, an empty hotel bed or an airline seat cannot be resold the following week or month. Such lost revenue impacts on cash flow, profitability, employment and ability to re-invest. The banks are not doing anything to improve matters. Have the banks commented on this situation? I have heard very little from them.</P>
    <P>This problem is affecting market confidence. There is a slow down in holiday bookings and many have dried up. Many cancellations have been made. Potential tourists are under the impression that Ireland is unsafe. Americans are of the view it is not safe to eat the food here. As Deputy Higgins said, money is not the problem, the message being sent out is wrong. The message people in the UK are getting is they should not go to Ireland unless they have to. That is the message being sent out as I speak and it has not been changed. It is now seven weeks since the first case of the disease and we have had only one incidence of it, not an outbreak. The Minister has failed dismally to get that message across in marketing this country. While those in the agricultural sector will get some compensation, people in businesses will get nothing. Have the Revenue Commissioners stated what they will do about PRSI, PAYE or VAT payments that are due? Will they give a derogation on VAT? We have heard nothing from that end. For people who must repay loans, lip service will not pay the bank. People who have invested heavily in tourism will not get anything. Much more needs to be done to encourage tourism while ensuring there is no risk to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Potential tourists are under the impression Ireland is not safe to visit. We must emphasise that Ireland is disease free, there is no threat posed to people, visitors are welcome and there is plenty for them to see and do as long as they observe the current guidelines and stay away from risk areas. The tone of the message from Ireland should be more evenly balanced and positive, which it currently is not. It should reflect the relaxation in measures introduced by the Minister, but news updates of the position with regard to foot and mouth disease on television do not convey that message.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on tourism need to be relaxed. Heritage and visitor centres that remain closed should be reopened, subject to adherence to the guidelines and necessary precautionary measures being taken. Urban to urban travel should be actively promoted in the domestic market and internationally. Where possible, angling and other activity holidays should be reinstated.</P>
    <P>A great deal needs to be done, as people involved in tourism will not survive this; they will go out of business. The Minister has a major job to do and he should do it now. It cannot wait.</P>
    <Col N="1358" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those involved in agriculture, agri-business and tourism in my constituency have been severely hit by the foot and mouth disease crisis. I will make a few points about agriculture before I address the issue of tourism. Can the Minister not talk to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, about establishing central locations for moving cattle to slaughter facilities and abattoirs? There is no reason such a measure cannot be put in place. Stock are not being brought back to farms, therefore, there is no risk of the spread of foot and mouth disease. The existing position is putting major financial pressure on hauliers and farmers.</P>
      <P>A permit system for the sale of stock farm to farm should be introduced. Store cattle in my constituency and throughout the rest of the country cannot be disposed of at present. Fodder is in short supply and people do not have the necessary resources to make the repayments currently due to the banks. One woman who telephoned me this evening told me she does not know where she will get the money to make the next repayment due to the Revenue Commissioners, as she cannot sell store cattle to obtain the money to make that repayment. This situation should be relieved immediately.</P>
      <P>Some sectors of the tourism industry, for which the Minister has responsibility, have reported a range of from 50% to 90% of cancellations. The Government, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has been telling people not to enter the countryside rather than not to go near farmland. It is important the correct message is conveyed, but that has not happened. The message being given in the UK, the Continent and in the US is not to visit outside urban centres in Ireland. That message will damage our tourism and it will not encourage people to visit here in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Many small family owned businesses are under severe financial pressure. The Minister should discuss with the local authorities the granting of rate reliefs to those businesses. He should meet officials in the banks face to face to agree terms and conditions to relieve the pressure on people in these businesses. He should ensure a short-term loan scheme is introduced to help those businesses overcome the problems they currently face. It is fundamental that should be done, as family run businesses are a major element of the infrastructure of our tourism industry. If they are put under pressure, that will damage the tourism infrastructure and the industry in years to come. Will the Minister take urgent action on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate a statement I made here when I initiated this debate many weeks ago about the marvellous work done by the Defence Forces, the Garda and officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in dealing with this situation. I hope the information that has been gathered about the illegal move<Col N="1359" /> ment of livestock here will be acted on and that such movement will be prevented from ever happening again. Maybe then this disease will be wiped out once and for all.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what Deputy Naughten said about farming. In my constituency there are farmers who wish to sell weanlings and store cattle. They are running out of their supply of fodder and they do not have grass to feed them. On the other hand, farmers down the road from them with grass have traditionally bought cattle at this time. There is no reason a permit cannot be introduced for farm to farm sale of stock. Irrespective of whether the cattle are on farmer A's farm or farmer's B farm, once the Department is informed of where they are, everyone concerned is secure.</P>
      <P>There is a danger the Minister and his Department will cause a serious split in the tourism industry due to the conflicting statements being issued with regard to whether the country is open or closed. The Minister should take that on board. Rural tourism, for example, the sector involved in angling, is dependent on the co-operation of the farming community for access to our lakes and rivers. They are not easily accessed without the goodwill of the farming community. Farmers are currently being told to put up notices with words &ldquo;please keep out&rdquo;. People involved in tourism, who are removed from farming, have set up guest houses in rural areas and are anxious to build up their businesses, have been told by farmers &ndash; they have got telephone calls about this &ndash;  not to bring English fishermen over here as they do not want them here. Goodwill is something that cannot be regained overnight. That goodwill exists and we must build on it. The Minister must clarify the situation &ndash; either the country is open or it is closed. Those two messages cannot be transmitted at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in my constituency have developed businesses to cater for coarse anglers from England and elsewhere on the Continent. They have invested heavily in their businesses, developed it over the years, ploughed profits back into it and upgraded their accommodation at the behest of the Minister's Department, which is only right. Those people were looking forward to an excellent year for their businesses this year and there was no reason that should not be the case, but suddenly, out of the blue, foot and mouth disease hit the British Isles and we have suffered as a result. The people concerned have commitments to their lending institutions and somebody must step in and help them. It is not good enough to ignore them or say that it will be okay in 12 months, by which time some of them will be gone. The Minister should immediately announce a rates remission and look at tax credits and rebates in the coming year to help them through this difficult period. They have made a substantial investment on which they will now have no return and which their bank managers <Col N="1360" /> will call them in to pay back. It is up to the Minister to stand by them in their hour of need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for allowing us the opportunity to discuss this issue. The main issues and problems in my constituency are presented by the tourism industry, hauliers and bus companies, mart owners and AI operators. I was pleased to hear that the Minister is to meet AI operators on Thursday. They have been out of work for some time. This has an effect on farming. I urge that they be allowed to return to work as quickly as possible, but under strict controls. It is hard to justify the reason they are not being allowed to operate considering some of the other activities being engaged in at farm level.</P>
      <P>The situation of hauliers, especially in Border regions, is extremely serious. About 60% of the milk to our local co-op in Monaghan comes from Northern Ireland. After processing it is hauled to other areas. That work has been lost. I hope it will be regained in the next few days, but the group concerned needs to be considered sympathetically, as do bus drivers whose buses have been idle because functions had to be cancelled. Mart owners are the one group which has lost out completely. As Deputy Naughten suggested, I urge that marts be utilised to bring livestock together. Trailers of animals could be brought to marts where the animals could be placed on lorries travelling to factories. The sheep of 20 farmers could be transported by lorry from Donegal in the Minister's constituency to Navan. Yet, trailers are being asked to travel in convoy. Raphoe mart could be used in this way. I urge that the matter be looked at.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what others have said concerning the tourism industry. There is a need for rates and loans relief. A small fishing shop in my local town of Ballybay has literally gone out of business. The people concerned need sympathetic consideration to help them over the hump. As tourism has a bright future, whatever needs to be done must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister to recognise the devastating effect foot and mouth disease is having on the economy because of the necessary restrictions and regulations imposed. The Government should respond positively to the call from Fine Gael to establish a special task force to work in conjunction with the appropriate economic sub-committee of the Cabinet to assess the impact on the economy and business in general. There is a deep crisis in the tourism industry which is a key contributor to the economic success of the State in recent years. In March alone the hospitality sector lost £40 million by way of cancellations and forward bookings. For the loss of every £1 million there is a consequential loss of 40 jobs. In March, therefore, there was a loss of 1,600 jobs. If this took place in a technological industry, there would be an immediate response from the Tánaiste and IDA Ireland which would <Col N="1361" /> establish a task force to ensure the situation was dealt with. If the current situation continues, there will be a loss of, at least, 20,000 jobs in the hotel and guesthouse sector alone.</P>
      <P>What is needed is immediate action to rescue the 2001 tourist season. The farmhouse holiday sector has been completely closed down. Forward tour operator bookings from abroad for June to September are down 70% on last year. This is the most serious crisis faced by the hospitality sector in the last 25 years and its effect is intense, especially in small family run properties which represent 78% of all hotels and guesthouses.</P>
      <P>There is massive confusion in the United States with regard to the situation in Europe. The funeral pyres are confused with the Indian tradition of burning human bodies. Foot and mouth disease is confused with a highly contagious disease &ndash; hands, foot and mouth disease. The Taoiseach should travel to the United States immediately for crisis communications to save the US market. The expert group is doing a good job. The communication of the easing of the restrictions is confused, unclear and creating extreme difficulties. Golfing holidays must be saved. There is confusion about whether golf courses are open or closed. There should be immediate clarification, especially for organisations which organise tours and holidays.</P>
      <P>There has been an enormous loss in the conference area. In Adare there has been a massive loss in conference business and the resulting spin-off to local businesses. The Government should immediately waive, reduce or defer VAT on accommodation and food sales from March to June to relieve the strain on premises. It should provide for an interest subvention and low interest loan scheme for an initial six month period to be reviewed at the end of August.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing time with me. The Green Party would welcome the establishment of a task force of the kind described in the Fine Gael motion. The high price paid and the pain of foot and mouth disease felt by many sectors are a true indicator of the downside of globalisation and the artificially cheap food policy being pursued by many multinational food outlets. In the preceding debate on the Treaty of Nice we heard about the opportunities offered by expanded export markets, but we also need to debate the need for freer imports and the associated threats to animal health. The message seems to be clear to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who said he wants greater local trade in tourism. That is needed and would be welcome. Other Ministers, however, seem to be devoted to specialised production for export markets as a policy priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal for a new focus for farming in Ireland with the objective of making this an island where produce is organically produced with surplus produce being exported and domestic needs being met to the greatest extent possible by domestic production. The continued industrialisation <Col N="1362" /> of farming will jeopardise the green, clean reputation which we have taken for granted for many years.</P>
    <P>Our second largest industry, tourism, soon to be our largest, will suffer as visitors report a less attractive, less diverse and less interesting rural landscape. Ireland enjoys six million visitors each year. They talk about more than 660 million day visits from urban areas to rural areas in the UK, bringing in between £2.6 billion and £7.9 billion annually to rural economies. We need to produce similar figures here to ensure we can measure the value to rural economies of a vibrant tourism sector.</P>
    <P>In France it appears the foot and mouth outbreak has not affected tourism to the same extent and I urge that we look at their policies to ensure we do not have a panic reaction here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;commends the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for his handling of the current foot and mouth emergency including the establishment of a Government Task Force to monitor the crisis and the necessary control measures with a view to preventing the spread of the disease; </P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the establishment of a Tourism Action Group involving Bord Fáilte, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the tourism industry, which monitors the impact of foot and mouth on the sector; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the action being taken by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Public Enterprise, in ensuring that the impact of foot and mouth prevention measures on the other sectors of the economy, in particular tourism, is minimised;</P>
      <P>and commends the public for their co-operation with the measures necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to indicate that it is the intention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to close this debate, barring some unforeseen circumstances, tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the present foot and mouth emergency, the primary preoccupation of the Government, supported in very large measure by the general public, has been to ensure that every conceivable step is taken to ensure the disease is contained to the one outbreak that has already occurred. As was pointed out by the <Col N="1363" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, if foot and mouth is not contained and eradicated, the tourism industry will almost certainly totally collapse. I have already indicated in two recent Dáil Adjournment debates, in a full day meeting of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation held on 22 March and earlier this afternoon in Seanad Éireann, that the possibility of a widespread outbreak of FMD in this country threatens our economic security and livelihoods, not just those of our farmers and the agricultural and food industry, but potentially of every citizen and in particular of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his staff for the competent manner in which they have tackled the emergency and for their extraordinary hard work and dedication over recent weeks. I remind the House that to date we have had just one outbreak.</P>
    <P>The recent heartbreaking and stark images from County Louth and Great Britain give some indication of what a full-scale outbreak would mean and put into perspective the sacrifices we have all had to make to date. It is important to appreciate that for tourism, a full outbreak would result in sustained negative international publicity, the possibility of even more intense internal and external travel restrictions and prolonged closure of many key tourism attractions and facilities. Let us hope and pray that we do not have to face such an appalling scenario. On behalf of the Government, I thank the tourism and hospitality industry which is at the economic front line in the battle against FMD for their support and patience in recent weeks in accepting the control measures which have had to be put in place. There is no doubt that the industry has taken a substantial hit in terms of lost business, but has been mature enough to see it as part of an essential contribution to the bigger objective of fighting the disease.</P>
    <P>The economic importance of the tourism sector should not be underestimated. It represents employment for more than 150,000 people and brings in over £3 billion annually in foreign exchange earnings. One in 12 jobs in Ireland is dependent on tourism. The sector represents more than 4% of GNP and makes a critical contribution to regional and rural development. The industry has almost doubled in terms of employment and increased threefold in terms of foreign earnings over the past ten years. However, because of its diverse nature and the number of small firms involved, the scale and importance of the tourism industry in modern Ireland is not always fully appreciated by the general public. While agricultural employment has decreased steadily in recent years, tourism has experienced phenomenal growth. The reports which we are now hearing every day of the impact and scale of the current FMD crisis on tourism will serve to <Col N="1364" /> get the message across that tourism is one of our major industries, not far behind agriculture in economic importance.</P>
    <P>The tourism and hospitality industry is now hurting as a direct result of the FMD emergency. The most up to date assessment of losses is put at approximately £200 million, excluding the impact on air and sea carrier receipts which is also substantial. If the current situation continues until August, it is estimated that the potential loss of overseas tourism revenue could rise to at least £500 million. This does not take into account the separate and very significant losses in domestic tourism and hospitality business due to cancelled events and conferences and an apparent continuing reluctance on the part of the general public to take short breaks in Ireland. Since the onset of the current emergency both myself, my Department and Bord Fáilte have been working very energetically to support the industry, and we have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline this evening ten specific actions which I am taking. First, I encouraged the tourism and sports sectors to take a series of initiatives in support of the national campaign to minimise the risks of a spread of FMD. Major industry groups, such as the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, asked their members to take a range of precautionary measures, Bord Fáilte suspended the active promotion of high risk land-based recreational activities, and sporting organisations and festival groups voluntarily cancelled or postponed events. These and other initiatives have demonstrated beyond any doubt the commitment of the tourism and sport sectors to playing a full role in combating the disease in the wider public good.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I set up structured arrangements to ensure that the views of the tourism industry are taken on board and that their concerns are made known, in particular when key decisions are taken about the control measures. I met on 8 March with a delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, to discuss the situation and have kept in close contact with the industry since then. I am a member of the key Government task force which at present convenes daily, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to monitor and review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The meeting is attended by up to six Ministers every morning. In addition, a separate high level tourism action group, chaired by the chief executive of Bord Fáilte, and including key ITIC representatives and my Department, has been established to monitor the situation on a continuous basis. This group has been meeting twice weekly over the past few weeks with the active participation and support of the industry. The objective is to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business already booked, and limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> We have been pressing very strongly in the appropriate fora for a phased modification, in so far as they, affect tourism, of the control measures in line with the evolving risk. This pressure brought about easing of the control measures announced on Friday, 16 March, by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This followed a report to him by a technical expert group, under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, supported by a separate report from the high level tourism action group. The guidelines issued by the expert group, together with the clarifications given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at his press conference, enabled a significant number of low risk events and activities in the tourism and sports areas to recommence immediately.</P>
    <P>With industry support, we have been pressing for the phased reopening of key State cultural and heritage attractions to allow a full and varied array of tourism facilities to be available to our visitors. National cultural institutions such as the National Gallery, National Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Chester Beatty Library, Dublin's City Hall, have remained open, together with most of the attractions operated by Dublin Tourism and Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>Following the easing of the control measures on Friday, 16 March, Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and the Rock of Cashel, reopened. On 27 March, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands announced that a further 11 heritage sites would be reopened the following day. I understand that has been extended to approximately 20 of the 36 that would normally be open at this time of year, and that the opening of further sites would be kept under review. This is very welcome news to the tourism industry. In a recent press statement, I have urged all those involved in the provision of tourism facilities and attractions to familiarise themselves with the guidelines of the expert group with a view to restoring as much of our key tourism infrastructure as possible.</P>
    <P>We are arranging through the Bord Fáilte Tourism Ireland website and the associated call centres, that there is regularly updated information available to visitors and the trade, including information about major attractions and events which are open. The Bord Fáilte website is updated daily and contains a very comprehensive regional listing of the tourism attractions which are open at present.</P>
    <P>Tourism related calls to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development FMD help line are now being processed through Bord Fáilte. Hot links between the key websites, including the Ireland.com <i>Irish Press</i> website, have been put in place.</P>

      <P>From today, the Department of <Col N="1366" /> Agriculture, Food and Rural Development website includes a special section aimed at visitors thinking of visiting Ireland. This highlights that there has been only one confirmed case of FMD in the Republic of Ireland, that FMD is an animal health issue and there is no danger to human health. It explains that while there are precautionary measures in place around the country, there is minimum disruption within the country.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that there is a clear message that Ireland is open for tourism business and that, subject to taking appropriate precautions, Ireland remains a welcoming destination for international visitors. I have already confirmed this in many press statements and it is entirely consistent with the recent specific advice on this subject from the expert group. The new guidelines mean that we can now welcome urban based visitors from the UK and other FMD-affected countries.</P>
      <P>This positive message was reinforced by the Taoiseach in his remarks on 22 March at the naming of the new Irish Ferries car ferry, <i>Ulysses,</i> and by Sir Reg Empey and me at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting last Friday in Letterkenny. I am arranging that these positive messages are highlighted also in Bord Fáilte's and in my own Department's websites.</P>
      <P>We have been pressing for an easing of the restrictions on the movement of people within Ireland to help the accommodation sector to recover from the effects of the cancellation of conference and seminar business and domestic tourism. Easing of restrictions on gatherings of people in defined locations by the expert group means that indoor meetings, conferences, and certain sporting events may now resume. Over the past week I have launched a strong appeal to the business community not to cancel or postpone conferences arranged for cities and towns throughout the country which are included in the lowest risk category specified by the expert group. In this regard the Government is writing to all Departments today to ask that they and their agencies take full account of the recommendations of the expert group and to ensure that activities are only curtailed where necessary, in accordance with the advice of the expert group.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 16 March the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources announced the lifting of the ban on angling with effect from the following day. Under new guidelines, sea angling is permitted, together with angling which does not involve access to land to which susceptible animals may have had access. This will go some way to meeting the concerns of the angling visitor interests who have been particularly badly affected by the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a meeting I had with the chairman and the chief executive, Bord Fáilte is launching a special tourism marketing and promotion reassurance programme which will kick into effect this weekend. This programme, which will have an initial component costing £3 million, will consist of tailor-made trade and consumer campaigns, joint activity with trade partners, and <Col N="1367" /> special consumer events in key European and US cities. I intend to lead these campaigns in the market place. Bord Fáilte has already identified savings from within its own budget to help meet the costs involved in mounting this campaign, and I have also sought supplementary funding from the Minister for Finance for this purpose. Timing is of critical importance, particularly for the campaign in the United States. It is intended to commence that campaign within the next couple of weeks. I am just about to finish&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give way, please? What response has the Minister had from the Minister for Finance for extra funding? Some £3 million initially seems very small. What extra funding will be available? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an initial component of the campaign which started last week. We will top that up to £6 million as of now, and if it is necessary the Minister for Finance and the Government will deliver the extra resources when they are needed. It is all a matter of the appropriate timing as to when it is needed.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that before Christmas, I launched the largest-ever annual tourism marketing programme for 2001, involving the joint expenditure by the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte of an amount of £100 million, of which approximately £35 million is Exchequer funding. I have also appealed to the industry to put together a programme and range of attractively priced short break packages to encourage the domestic market. We are looking at further initiatives to give home holidays a boost and I have already publicly appealed to people to holiday at home.</P>
      <P>I have appealed to the banks and to the financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners to be as sympathetic as possible in the case of any tourism business which experiences cash flow difficulties arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis. While the tourism industry saw unprecedented growth and success over the past decade, there are inevitable temporary setbacks in the economic cycle which do not undermine the medium to long-term sustainability of a business. I welcome the constructive response of the Irish Bankers Federation which was faxed to me yesterday. For the benefit of those who brought the matter up in the House, the document reads:</P>
      <P>The banks are very mindful of their role in supporting customers through this difficult period. The banks are committed to giving careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for particular support from those business customers that encounter financial difficulties as a consequence of foot and mouth disease. Such support may take the form of additional short-term credits, the rescheduling of existing credit re-payments and, where necessary, a moratorium on re-payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> The document also states that:</P>
    <P>It is crucially important that the banks are advised by their customers about the development of such problems as soon as they arise. Generally speaking, this will enhance the chances of finding a workable solution.</P>
    <P>The document finishes by saying that &ldquo;the banks are confident that they will not be found wanting on this occasion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I have confirmed that compensation of tourism interests is not possible, a more practical approach is to put in place an aggressive international and domestic tourism marketing campaign, supplemented by measures to help companies trade out of any temporary financial difficulties. My Department and Bord Fáilte are keeping the situation under close review with a view to making appropriate further adjustments, in consultation with the industry, to marketing and promotion activities planned for the year. While we are all conscious of the threat to agriculture, we must not lose sight of the extent of the impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. Our shared objective must be to ensure that unnecessary medium to long-term damage is not done to the tourism industry, which is now so important in economic terms.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has dealt successfully with crises in the past, including the fallout from the Gulf War and the problems of 30 years of instability in the North. It is a resilient and strong industry and while I know the industry is suffering at present, if we work together, we can successfully overcome this.</P>
    <P>This crisis will not unduly affect the economy and despite all of our problems the country still remains buoyant, with the Central Bank recently forecasting growth of 6.5% to 7%. Most countries in the EU would be delighted with such economic progress. This is a matter of timing. April 19 remains a date that is important to all of us. While we must be vigilant and keep restrictions in place for many months to come, the country can have a major degree of internal normality by 1 May. Advertisements will appear in British newspapers over the weekend clearly saying that: &ldquo;Ireland continues to extend a warm welcome to visitors from Britain. Yes, you can holiday in Ireland. Yes, there is lots to see and do and yes, you are welcome.&rdquo; Other advertisements will appear in the Irish press.</P>
    <P>To answer certain Deputies, we have plans to go to the United States. I do not want to contradict my counterparts in Great Britain or in Scotland as we may have different plans. However, it seems contradictory to have a Minister of a country appearing on CNN news beside burning pyres of cattle &ndash; as vividly described by Opposition Deputies &ndash; and on the same news bulletin to hear that Minister encourage people to visit that country.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of timing. We have an expert group here and 19 April remains an important date. I am confident, all being well, that Ireland will have returned to a large degree of internal normality by 1 May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Deputies about the potentially serious impact on the agri-food and other sectors which the spread of FMD would pose for the economy, employment and livelihoods generally. The special government task force is already working very effectively and efficiently to monitor the crisis and advise on necessary control measures, and together with other action and monitoring groups to address any serious problems emerging in affected sectors.</P>
      <P>The objective is to manage the crisis and limit any medium to long-term damage to our economy, including tourism, industry generally and other sectors. As already indicated by my Government colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, any attempt to predict the impact of FMD on the economic and budgetary outlook is highly conjectural. The main sectors at risk are agriculture, agri-business and the important tourism sectors.</P>
      <P>Within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a monitoring group representative of the Department of Education and Science and the State development agencies has been established to monitor the impact of FMD on industry and develop responses as appropriate. In so far as industry is concerned, the general feed back to date appears to be that FMD is not having a major impact on existing employment. However, a number of sectors such as food processing, as well as consumer products and agricultural machinery, are at fairly high risk if there is an escalation of FMD outside the Louth area. This will also be the case if the tourism sector does not pick up and the overall economy is impacted in the medium to longer term. The implications of a downturn in tourism would have significant impact on other sectors such as food and services because tourism is a huge employer, a huge revenue earner and attracts much foreign earnings.</P>
      <P>So far as the attraction of new overseas projects is concerned, the FMD controls are having some adverse impact in curtailing site visits. Obviously, the longer the controls are in place the more it will not help this programme and this is a worry for us.</P>
      <P>Overall, there is a consensus view emerging that the need for a marketing &ldquo;Sell Ireland&rdquo; campaign will arise to restore our image and position in markets abroad. The State development agencies, under the aegis of our Department, are in close contact with clients on the FMD issue, with a view to identifying difficulties arising and facilitating any necessary corrective action, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that my Department and its agencies will continue to monitor closely the impact of FMD on industry and arrange, where possible, for any necessary remedial measures to be put in place to address major adverse impacts. It is essential to ensure that all interests, including industry, co-operate fully in complying with the FMD control procedures, which have already been put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House appreciates the co-operation that <Col N="1370" /> the people have given to the strict measures put in place by the Government and particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his committee. There has been co-operation across the board from the public sector, the private sector, from consumers, citizens and visitors to Ireland. Urban and city people have been very positive in addressing and adhering to the regulations and rules as laid down. They have shown great appreciation of the value of agriculture to the economy and to rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the trading environment and the economy will continue to grow. The Central Bank has projected growth this year in excess of 6%. We are confident that will be achieved. We are in the early part of the spring. Let us hope we can address this problem together and maintain confidence and resilience. In the past when the economy had much lower growth rates and capacity and when consumer demand was much lower than it is today we adjusted to situations where there was no optimism or hope. We are now in a new environment. Let us be positive.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government amendment to the House. I am confident the Government and people will ensure that the economy continues to grow.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Penrose and Wall.</P>
      <P>After listening to that piece of knockabout from the Minister of State I am lost for words. This is not a debate about the strength of the economy or our confidence that the Government can lead us to a new Nirvana. We acknowledge the state of the economy. We are discussing the need to preserve employment and the revenue being generated in the industries that are affected by this crisis. I am puzzled by the Minister of State who, on the one hand, like the Minister for Finance tells us he cannot predict the impact of the foot and mouth disease on the economy and budgetary outlook &ndash; he says it is highly conjectural &ndash; and on the other says everything is okay.</P>

      <P>All parties have supported the Government's efforts to keep foot and mouth disease out of this Republic. In the early stages of the crisis we confined ourselves to highlighting weaknesses and gaps in official strategy. However, we have now reached the point where unnecessarily serious economic damage will be done, especially to our tourism industry, unless we achieve a sensible balance in our ongoing response to the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
      <P>The Government is sending out conflicting messages which will, and already are, leading to unnecessary confusion, economic damage and job losses. For example, the Department of Education and Science has banned all school excursions to the countryside. French school tour operators have, unsurprisingly, responded by deciding that if it is unsafe for Irish school children to visit the countryside it would be imprudent for French school children to do so. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation tells us he is intervening to prevent the abandonment of corporate conferences while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on his website is counselling against holding such conferences. Persons seeking guidance are given one line by the expert committee advising the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and a different line by the committee sitting in Bord Fáilte and advising the Minister on tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy said:</P>
      <P>So far as the attraction of new overseas projects is concerned the foot and mouth disease controls are having some adverse impact in curtailing site visits. Obviously, the longer the controls are in place the more it will not help this programme and this is a worry for us.</P>
      <P>Who wrote this speech for the Minister of State and what does it mean? Is the Minister of State saying that if a couple of foreign industrialists came to Ireland with the intention of putting a factory in County Donegal a site visit could not take place? The Minister of State has brashly read this nonsense to the House. Would potential industrial investors have their wellington boots sprayed before going to visit factory sites which are usually in urban settings? I have not ever heard anything so ridiculous. If I were in Deputy Treacy's place I would not read such nonsense to the House. At least Deputy McDaid made a serious speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confused signals and mixed messages may have been excusable in the early days of the crisis before the public was educated in the need for sensible precautions. There is no longer an excuse for the Government speaking with a forked tongue. Unless there is unity of purpose behind a considered balanced strategy serious damage will be done to an industry which generates £3 billion in foreign revenue per annum. Already some <Col N="1372" /> businesses have been hit quite badly. One operator I know of in the coach tour business who customarily takes 800 bookings per week at this time of the year is down to 120 per week. The knock-on effect of that is not difficult to envisage. It is clear that Americans have been adversely influenced by television footage of the burning pyres in rural England and by the irrational fear that there is a risk to human health and safety in this part of the world.</P>
    <P>We have been doing too little to counter these mistaken impressions. In terms of volume and revenue UK business is immensely valuable. The impact of a fall in numbers will quickly be felt by carriers and jobs. Bookings are rapidly drying up and our Government speaks with a forked tongue. If sensible precautions are taken and our reception facilities at ports and airports are thorough and adequate what precisely are we saying to British visitors?</P>
    <P>The domestic market could be mobilised to contain some of the damage to businesses now hurting but confusion reigns again. Urban dwellers believe that to travel to rural Ireland is officially frowned on. Most have responded to official injunctions not to visit rural Ireland. Now Deputy McDaid is beginning &ndash; and I support him &ndash; to promulgate the opposite message.</P>
    <P>It is past time that we moderated and sensibly finessed the &ldquo;don't go into the countryside&rdquo; message into something like, &ldquo;let us help plan your visit to the countryside&rdquo;. We need a powerful public awareness campaign that advocates sensible precautions and at the same time involves society's leaders giving a lead to holiday in Ireland this summer.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a speedy, authoritative analysis of what is happening to food prices in the shops. Anecdotal evidence suggests that excessive profit taking is the order of the day, notwithstanding the fact that our meat factories are busier than ever before. It is bad enough that hoteliers' bookings are down but having to pay more for foodstuffs is unacceptable. This will feed through to inflation and only then will the Government address this issue from the consumers' point of view. As we have seen with the price of alcoholic drink, once prices go up it is unusual for them to be brought back down.</P>
    <P>A £500 million downturn in the tourism sector is estimated to lead to job losses of between 15,000 and 20,000. Already workers' earnings in sections of the industry are down. This fact is not appreciated by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who talked about a minimal employment impact. There is already an employment impact. Even where people are still at work, in the hotel industry for example, earnings are down because while basic pay continues service charges are reduced.</P>
    <P>The Government should make arrangements so that people who lose their jobs in this crisis do not have to wait three days before being paid their social welfare entitlements. I ask the Government to intervene in the proposed withdrawal by Guinness from Dundalk, involving 200 jobs at a time when County Louth is especially <Col N="1373" /> badly hit by the fallout from the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, knows the value of the tourism sector to the economy. However, in the public utterances of the Government to date there is no evidence that he has persuaded his colleagues of the cost of continuing with the present divided strategy. The committee of experts has a job to do but where is the counterweight economic committee if we are to develop a balanced strategy before it is too late? If we continue to portray a state of siege we cannot blame foreigners if they believe we are in a state of siege. Americans believe our food and milk may be unsafe and if that view is outrageously erroneous it is not enough for us to shrug our shoulders at the odd beliefs of citizens of the United States.</P>
    <P>We need a coherent market recovery plan that commits the necessary resources to its implementation. Promotion and marketing must be a key element in that plan. So far it would appear those entrusted with selling Ireland are sitting on their hands because they are paralysed into inaction by the official line which up to now paid scant attention to the impact on the tourism sector. That must change and it is up to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to lead that change.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have contributed to the previous debates I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment all the bodies involved in ensuring that the various onerous restrictions which had to be put in place were observed and the regulations adhered to. Had those steps not been taken at that time we would have enormous difficulties now which would make the present difficulties pale into insignificance. The public has played a major role. I have already gone on record to compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his officials, the vets, the Army, the Garda Síochána and Civil Defence and all bodies that played a role. Some day we should acknowledge the role played by those bodies in another forum.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to state that we must remain on red alert and maintain a high level of vigilance in our efforts to contain and eliminate the foot and mouth scourge and ensure we get to normal as quickly as possible. The Cooley area of north Louth, which has seen the core of the economy devastated by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, is dependent on tourism and agriculture. The twin fundamentals of its economy have been dealt a significant blow. I hope the containment measures put in place work for that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crucial that we all remain steadfast in the fight against foot and mouth disease. Today critical foot and mouth tests on samples from Peamount in Louth and Bunclody in Wexford returned from Pirbright gave the all clear. The results are a tremendous relief. We must exhort everybody to remain vigilant as we approach the finishing line, which the Minister said is about two weeks hence on 19 April. We cannot let down our guard and must continue to be vigilant in relation to <Col N="1374" /> disinfectants and so on. One of the problems I witnessed recently, and particularly at the weekend, was that mats are dry. It is important to remain focused, otherwise all the good work could be rendered at nought in our attempts to succeed.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the review group under Professor Monaghan and the Minister's Department will, during the next week or so, examine the severe curbs in place and, where possible, relax same to allow some activities to proceed. I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte. The advertisements from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are a little bit misleading so far as they almost exhort people not to go to rural areas. It might be appropriate to advise people they are welcome in rural areas provided they do not go near farms. It is a matter of refining the advertisements to convey the message that Ireland is not closed down, that rural Ireland is still vibrant and ready to do business. It is amazing how messages get mixed up with a consequent negative impact. Obviously there has been a major impact on employment. Certainly Americans have been adversely influenced by TV footage of the burning pyres in rural England and obviously they assume that something similar is taking place here. Therefore, we must mount a comprehensive marketing onslaught to counter those mistaken impressions that may be prevalent there.</P>
    <P>Family run businesses have taken a hit. It is important that the banks play a role here. I raised this matter in the House last week. It was only on 30 March that the banks responded to the spokesperson on the Irish Bankers Federation. The banks made profits in the past three or four years in a conducive environment at a time when rates of capital gains tax were in their favour. It is time they gave back something and took steps to help out industries, be it the tourist industry, the agricultural industry or the wider industry. The Minister will also have to look at the question of abatement of rates and deferral of VAT. Those could be important practical steps at this time.</P>
    <P>Bookings are down. Farm holidays have been badly hit as well as walking tours. Forward reservations are down. I have learned in recent days that 57p out of every pound earned in tourism goes back into the Exchequer. That is a huge return and we should not forget that. In his speech the Minister indicated he would focus on marketing. I ask him to ensure that happens. Given the thrust of the Fine Gael motion the Minister should examine it because it is a constructive contribution to the overall national effort that has been seen to be effective in the past six to seven weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. Recently there have been many important debates in this House on the foot and mouth crisis. All Members have adopted a constructive approach and this has been recognised by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. I sincerely hope this <Col N="1375" /> same spirit of solidarity in the face of this crisis will be evident in this debate.</P>
      <P>The impact of the foot and mouth crisis on the local economy in Kildare has been dramatic. I have raised the problem of unemployment in south Kildare on many occasions here and, despite the national trend in unemployment, long-term figures in my constituency remain stubbornly high. The foot and mouth crisis has compounded this problem which affects three key areas of economic activity in south Kildare, namely, tourism, agri-business and the bloodstock industry. Layoffs have already occurred. Businesses are under extreme pressure and the outlook is bleak.</P>
      <P>The tourism sector in south Kildare has undergone tremendous development in recent years. It has some of the most outstanding attractions in Ireland such as the High Cross in Moone, the Japanese Gardens and The National Stud. The National Stud is developing a major tourism initiative. It is a tragedy that the foot and mouth disease has stopped this development in its tracks.</P>
      <P>I spoke with a number of people engaged in the tourism sector in the county recently, and they said they want the Government to agree to be centrally involved in relieving the temporary financial crisis that has hit many small family-run businesses. A structure such as that proposed in the motion could well be the way forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that cash flow is a vital element of small businesses. In the tourist sector, the seasonal nature of the business which results in low turnover in the winter months adds to the problem. I urge the Government to take on board a number of suggestions already made by the tourist sector as regards a waiver or deferral of rates. I would add a rider to that proposal that any loss sustained by a local authority would be made good by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Other proposals, such as high profile marketing campaigns in America, in particular, are urgently needed to save the tourism industry this summer.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, chairperson of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation will, together with her colleagues, present a number of proposals to the Minister this week. I urge the Minister to accept the committee's conclusions. That committee has met extensively with interests in the tourism sector recently and has put a tremendous amount of work into this vital issue.</P>
      <P>The agri-business in south Kildare has already suffered major setbacks in the wake of the BSE crisis. It is vital for the industry that the one foot and mouth outbreak in the State be confined to the Cooley peninsula. One has to sympathise with every member of the farming community in that area on the trauma they have suffered in recent weeks. The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, the Department and all the State agencies are doing all they can to ensure there is only one outbreak. The agri-business is of critical importance to the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the year I urged the Minister to establish a high level group to monitor and <Col N="1376" /> respond to the employment consequences of the purchase for destruction scheme. A group consisting of SIPTU representatives and departmental officials was established. There is now an unanswerable argument for this group to be expanded and given a central role in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis. Given the rampant spread of the foot and mouth disease in Britain it is likely that the restrictions currently in place may be with us for some time. It is vital that these restrictions are kept under constant review. It is imperative that the Government takes a central role in devising a coherent response to the economic consequences felt in every town and village.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1997, a UCD sociologist, Pat Clancy, prepared a report which indicated that the south-east had the lowest take-up rate of third level places. The report also highlighted that Kilkenny had the worst rate in the region. In response to this report, and encouraged by Mary McAleese and Queens University, in 1997 a local group in Kilkenny set about correcting the problem and establishing a third level outreach centre. NUI Maynooth and Carlow Institute of Technology now participate in a group which delivers third level courses in the region, mainly at St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, under the chairmanship of Pat O'Neill. A total of 120 students participate in these courses, 76 on BA courses, 13 on a special needs course, 15 on a youth and community course and 16 on a local history course.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, visited Wexford and Kilkenny in August 2000 where he made the welcome announcement that the Government was to fund a director and secretariat for the project. He also announced that it was to provide funding up to and beyond Christmas 2000 and that NUI Maynooth was to create or agree the job specification for the director.</P>
      <P>However, with the exception of £150,000 allocated by the Higher Education Authority to NUI Maynooth, the total package has not been delivered. The Wexford media have highlighted that this is to the annoyance of those involved in St. Peter's College. This fact is also to the annoyance of the steering committee in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The project is currently funded by NUI Maynooth, the local authority, local businesses and voluntary funds. In its report on outreach centres, the Higher Education Authority acknowledged the Kilkenny model as the most appropriate and worthwhile. The model delivers third level education in an efficient and economic manner. The method is economic for the Government as it utilises the entire education infrastructure and it is economic for students as it cuts out travel and accommodation costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project makes sense when one considers <Col N="1377" /> developments in communications and information technology and the fact that there is no university in the south-east. A project such as this must be developed organically, based on the demands of students and adults who wish to continue their education, and on the needs of local or regional commercial interests.</P>
    <P>The project is provided on an outreach basis. However, it also reaches out to the community. The project must be flexible and be able to adapt to meet the needs of the day. The project has strengthened the overall profile of Kilkenny and gives added value to efforts to develop a 60-acre digital park and other indigenous industries. The loss of the project would be unthinkable.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister should act on the commitments given in August 2000, respond to an application for funding made in December 2000 by the steering committee and appoint a director and secretariat forthwith. They must also fund the director to enable the project to draw together all third level courses being delivered in Kilkenny and to develop and encourage the take-up of third level places, reversing the trend in the south-east. Will the Minister respond to all the commitments given and give an undertaking that this project will be funded in future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy regarding third level education provision is based on the recommendations of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education. This committee was asked to advise on the future development of the higher education sector and to examine, within the overall national context, the needs for higher education on a regional basis and the appropriateness of the current institutional provision by regions to meet these needs.</P>
      <P>The committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional Technical College represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee's report recommended an increase in student places from 3,500 to 5,000 in the regional technical college, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in comparison with other regional technical colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepted these recommendations with the result that provision in the total number of places and in degree level courses in what is now Waterford Institute of Technology is being expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college to institute of technology, provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this <Col N="1378" /> approach, WIT will be among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualification (Education and Training) Act.</P>
    <P>The student stock in Carlow Institute of Technology has increased from 2,350 places in 1994 to more than 2,800 in 1999-2000. The steering committee projected that the stock in Carlow institute would increase to 3,000 in the next few years. The development plan being finalised for the institute will be based on these projections.</P>
    <P>The numbers for Waterford and Carlow take no account of the fact that significant numbers of students from the region attend other higher education institutions outside the region. In addition, each of these institutes has a range of special initiatives to increase access and participation at third level. New support services have been introduced including induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of at risk first year students.</P>
    <P>Also included in these measures is an access officer which the Minister for Education and Science allocated to each institute of technology last year. The access officer will have a role in supporting students throughout their college careers and will ensure that adequate resources and systems are in place to facilitate students to complete their course of study.</P>
    <P>Last August the Minister announced his plans to strengthen the education base in a number of regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions. His intention is to address the related problems of non-completion at second level education and low participation rates in higher education which are hampering development in these regions. The Minister indicated that he intends to put in place supports to encourage completion of the leaving certificate and to enable advancement to localised higher education opportunities.</P>
    <P>After his announcement the diocesan authorities responded by offering St. Peter's College, Wexford, as a location to facilitate development of a centre with higher education links. When he visited Wexford on 30 August last, the Minister indicated that he was prepared to provide funding to establish an outreach centre at St. Peter's College. He envisaged that the proposed centre would have a local management body and a dedicated budget. He also identified the need for a project plan as a necessary preliminary to the establishment of the proposed outreach centre. To this end the Minister suggested that a local co-ordinator-director be appointed to drive the project and draw up a project plan. He asked the director of the Institute of Technology, Carlow, and the Wexford county manager to submit a proposal to his Department in this regard, which they duly did.</P>
    <P>The proposal submitted to the Department would involve the creation of a new post and it was therefore necessary to seek the sanction of the Department of Finance before approval could be given for the proposed appointment. In this regard, the Department of Education and Science <Col N="1379" /> has had discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the availability of staff to progress the Minister's proposals at the local level. The Minister intends to take the matter up directly with the Minister for Finance with a view to finding a means of progressing his plans in Wexford. I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education and Science will continue to pursue the matter with a view to establishing an outreach centre in St. Peter's College at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As regards Kilkenny, both NUI Maynooth and the Institute of Technology, Carlow, are involved in separate outreach provision in the city. The Minister met local representatives in Kilkenny last August. A detailed strategic plan for the development of the Kilkenny campus was sent to the Higher Education Authority. Pending discussions of the proposal with representatives of NUI Maynooth, the Higher Education Authority allocated £150,000 to the project in December 2000.</P>
    <P>Following discussion of the plan with representatives of the university, the Higher Education Authority provided detailed advice to the Department at the end of January on the general question of outreach provision and on the specific issue of the university's involvement in Kilkenny. The Minister has considered this advice carefully and will shortly make an announcement in respect of the provision in Kilkenny.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tax Code.</Title>
    <P>Mr. M. Higgins: When the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, introduced deregulation of taxis he suggested that the measure was necessary. I questioned the measure at the time and suggested that reregulation and not deregulation was required. The Minister of State also suggested that he would be willing to listen to cases of distress or hardship.</P>
    <P>What has transpired is the reference in section 51 of the Finance Bill to capital allowances for expenditure incurred on taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances, effectively, are backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date. The cost can be written off over five years at a rate of 20% per annum in line with the new capital allowances regime for plant and machinery announced in the budget. This is an insult to those whom the Government placed at risk of losing their homes and for whom the capacity to rear and sustain their families was taken away by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what I have in mind. I deal with practical cases. A taxi driver who bought a licence for £70,000 from somebody who now drives around with one of the new licences for £5,000 had a taxable income of approximately £700 last year. It will take 100 years for what the Minister for Finance has proposed, at the request of the Minister of State, in section 51 of the Finance Bill to be of any benefit.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise immediately. There are, for <Col N="1380" /> example, the issues that arise in relation to the destruction of the value of an asset which was not created by those who applied for or bought it in what is referred to as the secondary market. The asset acquired its status by virtue of the fact that a limited number of licences were issued and the local authority operated a quota system. People, therefore, borrowed money. In another case, the licence was purchased for £58,000 by adding to the mortgage on a house.</P>
    <P>Those who spent £70,000 and £58,000 on licences have been asked to enter into competition with those who have not been asked to fulfil any requirements in relation to personal skills, size or quality of vehicle, commitment to a roster and commitment to provide a service during unsocial hours. They have to enter into competition with those who bought licences for £5,000. I ask the Minister of State not to tell me what is contained in the Finance Bill, but what the Government proposes to do to relieve the distress caused. I remind him that when the issue was discussed before I referred to an example in the United States in the 1980s where 24 cities experimented with deregulation. By 1993, only four were still operating a deregulated regime; all the others had reverted to regulation in some form.</P>
    <P>What is needed is an adequate supply of clean vehicles to meet public demand which are driven properly by people who are competent and committed to operating a full service which is not only available at peak times. The position is that anybody can apply for a licence and concentrate on the peak times. The wife of one of those who borrowed money, who is trying to rear her family and whose home is at risk told me that her husband is now working 90 hours per week. If the Minister of State wanted to look after the people he had impoverished, why did he not treat them in the same way as those who have deferred share options in companies? If he wanted to offer £5,000 licences, he should have purchased back all the existing licences and reissued them under a regulated scheme in terms of personal fitness, vehicle fitness, commitment to a roster and adequacy of provision for the public. We would then have had a level playing field. Those who were already in the market now have to drive around with the disability of having to work twice as hard to meet the commitments they made on the basis of an asset for which they received credit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the credit institutions and the banks which are already writing to many of the families I know of to remind them that they are over the limit in regard to their loans and that the collateral they offered is in danger of being seized. I cannot understand how in a democracy a judge in giving a judgment would say that he will only award half the costs where people forfeit their right to appeal. It seems to be an extraordinary judgment. I appeal to the Minister of State to announce further measures to relieve the poverty created by the Government by way of its crude deregulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The Minister for Finance regrets that he cannot be <Col N="1381" /> present to take the matter. I strongly object to the suggestion that the concession made in respect of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000, that is, the announcement date of the new taxi licence regime, is, in any way, inadequate in the circumstances. It is important to make the point that what has been offered is not compensation for taxi drivers. That was never the intention. What is on offer is a wear and tear allowance against an asset people would have purchased prior to 21 November 2000. This is a generous measure.</P>
      <P>Let me explain what is involved. It has been provided in section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, that in the case of the taxi licences to which I have referred a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred in purchasing a licence will apply. The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. Section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, provides that the write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question. Moreover, the capital allowances are, effectively, backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil Committee Stage discussion of the taxi licence issue the Minister for Finance introduced some further refinements to the provision, as it then stood, which are now reflected in section 51. The objective was to address some hardship cases that had been brought to his attention. Accordingly, the section also provides that where a licence was inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. This measure will only be available in respect of one licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax purposes may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if higher. On Committee Stage, discussion of section 51 centred around whether the value of the licence before deregulation should be used for such tax purposes in place of the actual cost of the licence, if higher. It is an underlying principle in the tax code that relief by way of capital allowances is only given in respect of expenditure actually incurred. There is no other situation where capital allowances are given in respect of notional expenditure incurred or on the estimated market value of an asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the difficulty with taxi plates arose at the end of last year, the Minister for Finance announced that he would give capital allowances <Col N="1382" /> on the cost of a taxi plate. The principle is that it has to be the actual cost, no matter how long ago the plate was purchased. As the Minister stated on Committee Stage, it would create an unheard of precedent in the tax code to start imputing a value, regardless of the cost incurred. The Minister will not establish the principle that, due to deregulation, we will impute a value higher than the actual purchase price of the plate. Those involved and who will continue to be involved in the taxi business are in a far better position after tax under the changes the Minister has made than they would have been under the old system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>How could they be if they do not have a taxable income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin scéal eile. Most of those involved in the taxi business have some income.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying wear and tear allowances on plant and machinery is that the asset wears out over time and depreciates to nil. The wear and tear allowances are given in recognition of this. In introducing an amendment which allowed value to be substituted for cost in cases where probate tax or inheritance tax was paid in respect of a licence, the Minister made an exception because he was trying to cater for a particular hardship case which was brought to his attention where £1,400 was paid in probate tax in respect of a taxi plate which formed part of the estate of a deceased taxi driver who had died intestate leaving behind a widow and children. For probate tax, the licence was valued at £70,000 and 2% tax was paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this serious issue and the Minister of State for coming to the House to reply. There is an urgent need for proper treatment facilities to be made available for those suffering from severe alcoholism in all parts of Ireland, but especially in the North Eastern Health Board area. Anyone from my county of Monaghan who seeks help must do so in Newry, Galway, the midlands or, if he or she can afford <Col N="1383" /> it, by attending a special clinic in Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Ireland is now recognised internationally as having a serious drink culture and even during the recent visit by former US President Clinton, his wife and daughter we highlighted that fact to the international media by virtue of the main function being held on the Guinness premises while the Taoiseach also hosted the president in his local public house. I have nothing against a social drink and the relaxation and enjoyment that many people derive from the pubs, clubs, hotels and other venues in which they meet. However, the fact that the Government takes in approximately £1.25 billion annually in excise duty and VAT on the sale of alcohol products must justify a small sum being spent to help those who succumb to the disease of alcoholism.</P>
      <P>One person in the health service stated recently that there was more help available for people with drink problems than there is currently. Is it fair that a person who was hospitalised as a result of an overdose, which was directly related to alcoholism, should be sent home the next day and told to pull herself together and go back to work two days later? She left work that day at 3 p.m. and went drinking. She had to be taken into care by a friend who was suffering from cancer.</P>
      <P>Many homes and families have been broken by alcohol abuse and where families split up, serious damage is often done to young children. Serious problems are created for health board staff, social welfare personnel and housing authorities, never mind the cost to the nation. Would it not be more cost efficient to provide facilities to help those people to deal with their problems and, thus, protect the family structure and, even more importantly, save young children from a much more difficult future with only one parent?</P>
      <P>Anyone listening to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; last week would have realised how widespread and serious is the problem and that something must be done. I listened to the programme as I travelled to the House and some of the stories were extremely frightening. St. Davnet's Hospital is located in County Monaghan and many patients who suffered from alcohol abuse were treated there years ago. That unit is responsible for many success stories. Why can such a unit not be used now that drinking is a much more serious problem? Family members and friends can visit patients in these units and they can be operated at a minimal cost.</P>
      <P>I was one of the few Members who questioned the legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which extended pub opening hours. It has meant that more young people spend their nights in pubs that close too late to justify going to dances and discos. I am aware of children aged 12 and 14 who have been found under the influence of drink and recently we witnessed students under the influence during their street protests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are encouraging alcoholism. Listening to people who attend at my clinics, similar to those who attend the Minister of State's clinics, it is clear that, while they still love the family member affected by alcohol abuse and want them to <Col N="1384" /> receive treatment and be free of their addiction, the lack of proper treatment service at local level means they feel abandoned and let down by the State. People in this scenario often opt to approach members of the legal profession to obtain barring orders or separation agreements. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, health boards and local authorities bear the cost.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State justify the lack of services? Can some of the £1.25 billion in tax revenue be used to help these people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse, as set out in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment. The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol dependence are psychotherapy, counselling, family and marital therapy, either individually or in group settings. Therapy may take place in a residential or a day setting. As alcohol related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems.</P>
      <P>Health boards are also considering ways in which services provided by voluntary and/or private facilities might integrate with the health boards' services. Most health boards have made local arrangements to enable access to specialist in-patient treatment facilities in the small number of cases where the need arises in this connection. Examples of such facilities include The Rutland Centre, Dublin, Cuan Mhuire, Limerick, Cuan Mhuire, Kildare, Tabor Lodge in Cork, Aiseirí, Wexford, and the Aislinn Centre in Kilkenny.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services for the treatment of alcohol related problems in the north-east has undergone major changes in recent years. Following on the board's strategy document on alcoholism and addiction, the development of services has been community based with particular emphasis on early intervention, close links with the primary care services and active liaison psychiatry. Detoxification is now predominantly home based and supervised by general practitioners. Admissions to general medical wards take place in a small number of cases where it is clinically indicated. Occasional admissions to St. Davnet's Hospital take place where there are major behavioural problems or in the context of psychiatric morbidity.</P>
      <P>A new community service is based in the Monaghan health care unit which also serves the Cavan community and community services are made available throughout the board area. Counselling services for alcohol addiction are available in Louth and Meath. The North Eastern Health Board also has arrangements in place for the provision of specialist in-patient treatment services for its clients in the Rutland Centre in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The approach to alcohol related problems should be based on prevention rather than on treatment. In this regard a new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers was launched in February. This campaign emphasises the choices open to young people and promotes a healthier lifestyle. The Alcohol Awareness Campaign carries the slogan &ldquo;Less Is More &ndash; It's your Choice&rdquo;. It promotes alternative activities to drinking and encourages people to examine their whole lifestyle. The messages of the campaign are communicated through media reporting, local community initiatives, youth organisations, and the highlighting of best practice examples of how to tackle the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>An important element of the campaign was the development of a dedicated website, www.coolchoices.ie. The site provides factual information for young people on alcohol, myths about drinking, and facts and tips for teenagers. There is a particular focus on binge drinking and its consequences for health, relationships, life options and opportunities. Nationwide activities and initiatives will be sign posted on the site and there will be links to other websites of interest to young people. The site is currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>As part of the Less is More campaign, the health promotion unit held a seminar which was attended by more than 100 stakeholders &ndash; health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and the Garda. The purpose of this was to demonstrate examples of best practice in dealing with issues such as under-age drinking at a local level. Further activities planned for this year include college campus initiatives, an international conference and further development of the website. The health promotion unit is also involved in a number of other alcohol related initiatives. These include education programmes, training for publicans and their staff and research on advertising.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment debate. I have been contacted by a number of people who have in the recent past made application to the Department for funding towards the provision of child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The Department allocated £20 million for this programme in 2000. There was a great furore about the announcement. It was in RTE's news programmes and in all the national media. The public welcomed the allocation with open arms. Later that year a second announcement was made in relation to the scheme. I must compliment the PR staff in the Department. They did an excellent job because the story was in the news headlines on RTE at six o'clock and nine o'clock. The PR staff earned their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £3.8 million was allocated to capital projects but only £58,000 of that amount was spent up to November last year. The rest of the money stayed in the Department. I am sure there <Col N="1386" /> will be further announcements in relation to child care in the next few months, more furore and extra money for the PR people.</P>
    <P>One would need to have several degrees to complete the application forms, as well as being an accountant and health expert. That is probably the reason so many applications have been returned and there have been so many refusals by the Department. It is also the reason only £58,000 was spent out of the £20 million last year. That is political fraud at its worst.</P>
    <P>There is huge need for proper child care facilities in the State. People are crying out for them. There is also a need to increase the £40,000 grant. That sum is not sufficient, given the price of building materials. The success of the economy has resulted in costs increasing and £40,000 is not a reasonable contribution from the State. It should be increased to £100,000.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that neither the Minister nor the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present for this debate. Both must be embarrassed. One could not defend what has happened in the Department over the last year. I am sorry they have sent my colleague, Deputy Moffatt, to fight this case. One cannot fight a case where only £58,000 of an allocation of £20 million has been spent on child care provision even though parents are daily seeking child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might look at a problem within the Department of Health and Children. The Western Health Board region lost a substantial number of child care places as a result of over-checking by the Department. That is fine if the State were doing its duty and helping these people by giving them the grant aid. That would make child care viable for the providers instead of reducing the number of places. If the business is so profitable, why are more people not involved in it? There is a shortage of child care places throughout the State; the State has let people down in that regard.</P>
    <P>The heavy folder I have with me is an application form from one of my constituents. It took them almost 12 months to put it together. It is outrageous that more obstacles are being put in people's way instead of helping them to get into this sector. We should help people who want to do the job well. Of course, nobody condones people such as those involved in the court case last week. We cannot condone people who do not fulfil their responsibilities, collect money under false pretences and do not look after the children in their care. I and the Minister would condemn that.</P>
    <P>There are genuine people, however, who are trying to provide these facilities and to make a small profit. One arm of the State is putting every possible rule and regulation in their way while another provides application forms that are so difficult the applicants are unable to draw down the grant aid. In addition, the capital allocation of £40,000 is not enough.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, regrets that he cannot be here for this Adjournment debate. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated £250 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding, over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the matter of simplifying the application forms. Applications are considered by a programme appraisal committee established by the Department. The programme appraisal committee makes a recommendation on each application, following an initial assessment carried out by ADM Limited on behalf of the Department. In order to give each application a full and fair assessment, it is necessary for each applicant to give information relating to their child care service. The assessment of applications is based on material supplied by the applicant and each application is considered under the following five assessment criteria &ndash; the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant to implement the project, the level of integration/co-ordination and the costings/value for money of the proposal.</P>
      <P>During the development of the equal opportunities child care programme application forms, extensive consultations were undertaken with the national voluntary child care organisations, community based child care providers and other Departments. ADM Limited, who has operated many other schemes on behalf of Departments and is most experienced in this field, was also consulted during the process. Much of the information requested in the application form is of a basic nature, for example, name of applicant, tax details, ownership of premises, experience in the child care sector, management procedures, details of the child care service to be provided, compliance with health board regulations and so forth.</P>
      <P>If required, assistance is available from the Department and from ADM Limited when the application forms are being completed. Both officials of the Department and ADM Limited have held information sessions throughout the country and are available to do so when requested. Funding has also been provided by the Department to the national voluntary child care organisations, area partnerships and community groups to provide support to child care providers. This support would include assistance during the application process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important development in each county is <Col N="1388" /> the establishment of county child care committees, currently at an advanced stage. The county child care committees will be charged with formulating a child care plan for each county. The county child care committees will be best placed to provide the facilities for assistance and advice at local level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that to address the child care needs of the country it is vital that funding is invested in quality child care services. Any child care service that receives funding under the Department's equal opportunities child care programme must be of the highest standard and be a service that will be available and viable into the future. Where community projects are concerned they must serve the needs of the parents and children of the whole community. There are also financial requirements of the State and the EU for which information is required.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not consider that there is a need to change the application forms at this stage of the programme. Over 675 completed applications for funding under the capital and staffing grants schemes of the equal opportunities child care programme have been returned up to 14 March 2001. A total of 373 of these applications have been approved for funding. However, if the Deputy is aware of any specific difficulties that are being experienced by applicants, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would be glad to look into them.</P>
    <P>The capital grants currently available under the Department's equal opportunities child care programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care, established under Partnership 2000. Capital grants of up to £40,000 are available to self-employed or private child care providers for building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of permanently based child care equipment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied that the current grant level is meeting the requirements of self-employed or private child care providers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the recent article in <i>Forbes</i> magazine to which the Deputy refers has come to the notice of officials both in my Department and in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Indeed, both offices were approached by the Irish media in relation to the article and it received some coverage in the national press and on radio.</P>
      <P>Inquiries have been carried out by the Revenue Commissioners concerning the matter. As part of this process, I understand that contact has been made by Revenue officials with their counterparts in the US Internal Revenue Service &ndash; IRS &ndash; under the aegis of the Ireland-US double taxation convention. These contacts are ongoing.</P>
      <P>As regards US taxation, I should point out that there is no indication that the scheme in question involves the illegal evasion of US tax. Rather, it appears to be an aggressive tax avoidance scheme aimed at taking advantage of certain provisions in the US tax code to shelter income which would otherwise be liable to US tax. It may well be that ultimately such schemes will be challenged by the US revenue authorities. I can assure the Deputy that should the US revenue authorities require any assistance from the Irish authorities in relation to this matter, full co-operation will be extended by Revenue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners are examining this matter in relation to any Irish tax consequences that may arise from the use of Irish companies. It goes without saying that the interests of Ireland are not served by high profile magazine articles linking the use of Irish companies to aggressive tax planning activities in other countries and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will take whatever measures are appropriate in order to <Col N="1390" /> preserve our international reputation and the integrity of the Irish tax system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to a question on these lines which I answered last November. While the position has not changed significantly since then I would like to take this opportunity to add some observations. Ireland has been active in seeking reform of the Bretton Woods institutions in a variety of areas over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>On the issue of debt relief, the House will be aware that I am a strong advocate of greater speed and flexibility in implementing the enhanced HIPC initiative. With our co-constituents of Canada and the Caribbean countries we have been pressing for reforms in order to bring faster and more effective progress on poverty reduction.</P>
      <P>In this context I stressed in my contribution to the annual meetings in Prague that the parameters of the HIPC initiative should be kept under review, with a view to appropriate remedial action where necessary. During 2000 such remedial action became necessary in the case of Zambia. I informed our representatives at the bank and fund that Ireland would support any action necessary to ensure that Zambia's debt service obligations were reduced, and that account should be taken of the capacity of Zambia to service any post-HIPC debt, even if this would require extra funding on the part of the donor countries.</P>
      <P>I also indicated to our representatives that a further enhancement of the terms of the HIPC initiative may be required in order that human development indicators are taken into account when calculating debt service sustainability, so that expenditure on social services is assured before any debt service is deemed to be payable.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the International Monetary Fund recognised the exceptional circumstances facing Zambia and made special arrangements to reduce its debt service payments. I will continue to work for the maximum possible degree of generosity to be shown toward HIPC countries. In fact, the combination of debt relief under the HIPC initiative and the additional relief offered by individual countries should lead to a two thirds reduction the overall debt of HIPC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue of concern is that off country representation at the institutions. I am in favour of a greater say for the emerging and poorer countries. There are a number of ways in which this might be achieved &ndash; for example, through board representation or enhanced involvement in decision making generally. In addition a vital <Col N="1391" /> aspect of the whole reform programme, and one which we fully support, is more consultation with the developing countries both at governmental and civil society level.</P>
    <P>On the issue of transparency, Ireland has always been a supporter of greater transparency in the operations of the institutions. I am glad to say that this view is now prevailing and I welcome the extent to which progress has been made and will continue support further reforms in this area. In recent years both the bank and the fund have sought to improve their contacts with civil society groups and to increase the transparency of their own decision-making processes. This is particularly in evidence through the dramatic increase in documentation being released through the institutions web sites.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am fully supportive of greater co-operation between the World Bank and the IMF. Both institutions are aware of the necessity for better co-operation and the need to rationalise their own operations and this is being addressed.</P>
    <P>The trip to Africa early this year by Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Kohler honoured a commitment they made at the Fund-Bank annual meetings last year in Prague to put Africa at the centre of the activities and the agenda of both institutions. During their trip they met with African heads of state to listen to them about their vision of how Africa can accelerate growth, about their most serious development challenges and priorities and to look at ways that both the fund and the bank can lend support in furthering these objectives.</P>
    <P>The staffs of the fund and bank will need to co-operate closely, focusing on their traditional areas of expertise in line with past agreements between the two institutions. Many areas will need to be shared between the two staffs, such as the establishment of an environment conducive to private sector growth, trade policy, financial sector development, and improvements in governance and transparency.</P>
    <P>Equally, I see the need for co-operation between the Bretton Woods institutions and other multilateral institutions in development. This is being addressed, not least through the upcoming conference on Finance for Development which will involve, in addition to the Bretton Woods institutions, WTO and various UN bodies.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working through the European Union and the boards of the Bretton Woods institutions in collaboration with our EU partners, to support a more open trade and development oriented view in relation to developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Research on gender imbalance in the Civil Service at HEO level and above, commissioned as part of the SMI process, and published in 1999, showed that women were under-represented at senior management levels in the Civil Service and that progress towards a better balance of men and women in those grades had been minimal in the ten year period from 1987 to 1997. The report identified the under-representation of women in the assistant principal grade as a particular obstacle to the advancement of women to senior management levels within the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and myself at the launch of the current phase of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999.</P>
      <P>A key element of these measures was the development and adoption of a new equality policy. A high level Gender Equality Management Group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, is at an advanced stage of developing a new gender equality policy for the Civil Service. The group has decided to produce three separate documents relating to revised policy and procedures for addressing gender equality. The three documents are: a new gender equality policy; a guide for Departments on affirmative action entitled &ldquo;Making it Happen&rdquo; and an outline of mechanisms for the allocation of responsibility, accountability and monitoring in respect of gender equality.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, the Government approved the new gender equality policy in principle and directed that consultations with the staff unions on the implementation of the new policy should begin. At the same time, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had set a target of one third of posts at Assistant Principal level to be filled by women within five years.</P>
      <P>The consultations with the staff unions are now at an advanced stage and I expect that they will be concluded shortly. The new gender equality policy should, therefore, come into effect early this summer. In anticipation of the policy, Departments have been asked to adopt increasingly specific strategic objectives and equality goals, to be published as part of each Department's annual strategy statement, with a view to achieving the one third target at assistant principal level over the next five years and to increasing the representation of women at all grades above that of assistant principal during the same period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the inter-departmental review group, under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was set up to review the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme. The principal issue of concern expressed by the public and by public representatives in connection with the reliefs under the scheme was, and still is, in relation to the medical criteria. Arguably, the continual pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its valuable reliefs, giving access to tax free cars and motor fuel, in effect, for life. I understand that, while no further written or oral submissions are expected, the work of the group is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons who have severe permanent physical mobility problems. While the number of potential beneficiaries is unclear, there are up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. I would expect that many of these persons are already fully self-sufficient in terms of private transportation. In any event, not all of this number would or could use any widened scheme, but the substantial tax benefits make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that the review group has no definite figures of the likely number of extra disabled persons who may benefit under the scheme should a widening of the scope of the medical criteria be agreed on completion of their review. However, given the level of benefits available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. As Deputies are aware, the scheme is not means tested and the average benefit per person is approximately £4,000 on the basis that more than 90% of the present cohort of beneficiaries claim in respect of the purchase of a new car every two years. Clearly, the present level of benefits under the current scheme could be difficult to sustain <Col N="1394" /> even if a fraction of the figure of 350,000 were allowed to gain admittance to the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, having said that, I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some form or other of physical disability face in coping with every day life, particularly with regard to transportation and I can assure the House that any proposals, whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise, which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the Disabled Drivers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations. 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under the regu<Col N="1395" /> lations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.</P>
      <P>The 1994 regulations were drawn up following wide ranging consultation with the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, Opposition spokespersons for finance and organisations representing disabled persons.</P>
      <P>The issue of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail during the review process, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to other medical categories. The review recommended that the then existing specific medical criteria should remain broadly unchanged.</P>
      <P>The principal issue of concern expressed in connection with the reliefs then was, and still is, in relation to their scope. Arguably, the pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its substantial benefit in terms of the tax relief available.</P>
      <P>The current medical criteria are designed so that people who qualify for the scheme do so irrespective of the original cause of their disability and this is considered to provide for equitable treatment of those with severe mobility difficulties.</P>
      <P>As I am on record as saying in this House, I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with every day life. There are very many people with various forms of disability who would consider themselves as having a genuine case for the tax relief. Given the level of the benefits available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 7,000. The cost of relief in 2000 was in the region of £22 million, as compared to £4 million in 1994, which shows just how this scheme is being sought out and used. The scheme is not means tested.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, this scheme is currently under review by an inter-departmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, the group has representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria. I understand that the work of the committee is ongoing.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments, including unemployment benefit, are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating such benefits as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity. A person who has been in receipt of UB and then takes up employment is treated as if the moneys from unemployment benefit had arisen from employment. The extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of other income that a recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit was made taxable with effect from 6 April 1994. There have been a number of changes in the arrangements for the taxation of this benefit since then. Unemployment benefit paid to those on systematic short time work was made exempt from taxation in the Finance Act, 1994. This measure, which initially had effect only for the 1994-95 tax year, has been extended in each subsequent Finance Act. This relief relates to the unique position of those on systematic short time work.</P>
      <P>In the 1995 budget, to assist families, the child dependant additions payable with UB were made exempt from tax. Second, the first £10 per week of UB was also made exempt from tax from 6 April 1995. I have no plans to change this at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20 July 2000, I announced that from 2002 the income tax year will be aligned with the calendar year. From that point, budget day tax changes and social welfare weekly rate improvements will be brought forward to 1 January. This will be of importance to taxpayers and social welfare recipients who will benefit earlier from budget day changes compared to the current position where tax changes apply from April and social welfare changes from May.</P>
      <P>A Department of Finance working group was established to report on the date of budget 2002. As part of its deliberations, the group consulted officials from both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the group favoured moving to an earlier budget date than at present for the years subsequent to 2002 when once-off factors such as the short tax year and the euro changeover will <Col N="1397" /> not apply. The group also concluded that, on balance, a December date for budget 2002 minimised the potential risks for this year.</P>
    <P>The date of budget 2002 was subsequently announced as taking place on Wednesday, 5 December 2001 with budget day tax changes being put into effect around end-February 2002. Where relevant, this will involve a once off correction payment to cover any arrears from 1 January 2002. Social Welfare changes will come into effect from mid-February onward and will also include a lump sum payment to cover any arrears from January 2002. It should be noted that under current arrangements, even if the budget date were moved to an earlier autumn date, those on long-term social welfare benefits could not have been paid their increases from January 2002.</P>
    <P>The working group's report is available on the Department's website, and I am arranging to have a copy sent to Deputy Spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that significant difficulties are being experienced by certain sectors of the economy as a result of the foot and mouth crisis and I am sympathetic to their plight. I am aware that there have been calls for assistance from the Government by particular sectors. I do not see it as appropriate to introduce general compensation measures for all sectors and individuals whose activities may be affected by the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>As regards some of the suggestions for temporary tax reliefs, I believe that it would be difficult to consider relieving any sector of the legal requirement to pay taxes owed to the Exchequer or agreeing any general postponement of the collection of taxes for certain sectors. The impact of the foot and mouth crisis has extended beyond the sectors and geographical areas most immediately affected and it could be argued that any general tax measures would inevitably encompass a very large number of cases. Many of these taxes such as VAT or PRSI are collected by individual businesses on behalf of the State. Any general short-term relief would also create long-term difficulties for businesses which would have to pay both their ongoing and arrears of taxes when the crisis has abated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in so far as particular cash flow problems arise for individual businesses Revenue does as part of normal arrangements look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis in individual cases where <Col N="1398" /> problems are being experienced as a result of a cash flow crisis suffered by the business.</P>
    <P>As for individual employees who find themselves laid off as a result of the foot and mouth crisis, whether these individuals are employed in agriculture and related areas or in sectors indirectly affected by the crisis, such as tourism, any such employees are entitled to claim unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit as appropriate. Similarly, any farmers who are experiencing income difficulties as a result of the crisis can claim farm assist, the means-tested scheme of income support for low-income farmers. In regard to these schemes, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has ensured that any such claims within the County Louth area, which is the area most directly affected by the crisis, will be processed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am making some funds available to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to assist Bord Fáilte Éireann in an overseas marketing campaign, in response to the difficulties being experienced by the tourism industry as a result of the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 31 October last year the Revenue Commissioners made a report to the Committee of Public Accounts giving details of the total amount of £173 million in DIRT, interest and penalties determined and collected as a result of the look-back DIRT audits of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Revenue have informed me that they are nearing completion of their consideration of the question of the most efficient and effective approach to recovering underlying tax in respect of funds concealed in bogus non-resident accounts. Determining the appropriate approach requires careful consideration to ensure that the process of pursuing the liabilities is effective in recovering amounts due. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are preparing guidelines and that their position will be finalised after the analysis of the legal and other issues, which is well advanced, has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, the figures requested by him are not <Col N="1399" /> available at this stage. I understand that, in advance of the main investigation by Revenue, there have been 86 disclosures to Revenue of bogus non-resident accounts and that 56 of those disclosures have been accompanied by payments on account, principally by account-holders with large accounts. The payments on account made by these account-holders to date amount to £6.627 million. This represents an average payment of £118,000 in the cases where payment was made.</P>
    <P>I am informed that no amount of outstanding tax has been written off in these cases, nor has any consideration been given to writing off underlying tax due by the holders of bogus non-resident accounts. The Revenue Commissioners will be pursuing payment of this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies might expect, any attempt to predict the impact of foot and mouth disease on the economic and budgetary outlook is highly conjectural. This is because the future development of the disease is itself unpredictable. If there were a significant outbreak, the main effects would be losses due to the culling of animals, losses due to restrictions on sales in export markets and losses to the tourism sector. The main sectors at risk are primary agriculture and the agri-business and tourism sectors.</P>
      <P>Obviously, if the outbreak remains relatively limited in extent and duration then the economic and budgetary impact would not be very significant. However, if foot and mouth disease were to spread to reach the kind of level currently experienced in the United Kingdom then this would have significant economic and budgetary implications. Commentators have estimated that, in the event of a serious outbreak, economic growth could fall by up to 1.5% this year. I would not disagree with these estimates as reasonable orders of magnitude. If the impact was of this order the budgetary outlook would also be affected.</P>
      <P>This Government is making every effort to minimise the risk of the disease spreading. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the public for their co-operation in this national effort and to ask them for their continued patience in our campaign to keep foot and mouth disease from spreading any further.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that various employers and interest groups have voiced their concern regarding the removal of the employer PRSI contribution ceiling and the impact this will have on the business climate.</P>
      <P>As I said recently in reply to a question on the same topic, the changes to PRSI must be seen in the wider context of the significant improvements in the overall business climate. While it is appreciated that not all businesses will have benefited from the significant corporation tax reductions achieved in recent years, very many have done so. In addition, a wide range of enterprises will also benefit from the improvements I announced in the budget in the capital allowances for plant and machinery. Furthermore, our employer PRSI system continues to compare very favourably with the EU norm. Overall, therefore, the environment for business continues to be very positive.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to alter the decision regarding the removal of the PRSI contribution ceiling, however, I have also stated on many occasions that I intend to press ahead with the reform and simplification of the PRSI and levies system which has become particularly complex over the years. In progressing this agenda in my next budget, I will take into consideration the views expressed by the various employer groups.</P>

The Government remains committed to the terms of the PPF as adjusted. The PPF contains a framework to allow the concerns of the CPSU about pay to be addressed. A fundamental part of the PPF, as far as the public service is concerned, is the provision for a benchmarking exercise, which will carry out a comparative examination of jobs in the public and private sectors. I am glad to note the CPSU is engaging in the benchmarking exercise.

      <P>While I have no plans for the introduction of a scheme on the basis suggested by the Deputy, he should be aware of a number of legislative and other proposals which are under preparation and which are referred to below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> In common with all citizens of the State, public servants have a duty to act within the confines of the law and report any matters that are illegal to the appropriate authorities. Where they have reason to suspect the occurrence of fraud or other wrongdoing, they also have a duty to report such matters to the appropriate authorities. Normally cases of misconduct or serious irregularities would be investigated, in the first instance, by the Government Department or public body, as employer, leading to a Garda investigation where a suggestion of criminal activity arose.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have direct responsibility for the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants. In that context my Department has recently prepared a code of standards and behaviour for civil servants, which sets out in a single document the principles and values which should govern their behaviour in the discharge of their duties. The code consolidates and updates long standing instructions issued by my Department over the years and sets out a clear framework within which the civil service must work.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Deputy may also be interested to note that it is intended to amend the Standards in Public Office Bill to give protection for persons who, reasonably and in good faith, make complaints, including complaints about cases of potential corruption, to the proposed standards in public office commission. The Bill provides for the establishment of a new commission which will enjoy full tribunal powers and which could investigate complaints involving acts or omissions of politicians and public officials where the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with the proper performance of the functions of the office concerned or with the maintenance of public confidence in their performance.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also preparing whistleblowers protection legislation, which, it is intended, will apply to and protect all employees, including public servants, who make disclosures &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; regarding issues such as the conduct and affairs of their employers.</P>

      <P>As of 19 February 2001 there were 607 applications for review on hands in the office of the Information Commissioner. In addition, there were 76 applications for review in relation to whose validity a decision has yet to be taken, i.e. the commissioner has yet to decide whether these are cases which <Col N="1404" /> he must review. There is no standard waiting time for dealing with reviews. The complexity of the cases on hands varies and, accordingly, the time taken to complete reviews varies.</P>
      <P>The commissioner is very concerned at the delays which are arising in dealing with reviews. In February 2000 the Minister for Finance sanctioned the appointment of a number of additional investigators to the commissioner's office. The delays inherent in the recruitment process meant that these additional staff did not take up duty until late in the year 2000. With the appointment of these new staff the commissioner is hopeful of making significant inroads on the arrears situation. However, he estimates that it will take up to three years to achieve a situation where review decisions meet the four month time limit &ndash; reducing to three months in April 2001 &ndash; required by section 34(3) of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>

It may not hold itself out or represent itself as a bank here, and to do so would involve a breach of the law.</P>
      <P>As I said in response to a question from Deputy McDowell on this issue on 20 February last, it is a matter for the relevant authorities here, including the Central Bank, the Garda Síochána and the DPP, to determine whether there have been any breaches of Irish legislation in relation to money laundering and what action to take if the law is broken.</P>
      <P>I understand that such determinations have not yet been concluded and in this context would note the strict requirements as to confidentiality which apply to the Central Bank and the DPP.</P>

    <P>Research on gender imbalance in the Civil Service at HEO level and above, commissioned as part of the SMI process, and published in 1999, showed that women were under-represented at senior management levels in the Civil Service and that progress towards a better balance of men and women in those grades had been minimal in the ten year period from 1987 to 1997.</P>
    <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and me at the launch of the current phase of the Strategic Management Initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, the Government approved the new gender equality policy in principle and directed that consultations with the staff unions on the implementation of the new policy should begin. The consultations with the staff unions are now at an advanced stage and I expect that they will be concluded shortly. The new gender equality policy should therefore come into effect early this summer.</P>

      <P>I did not at any stage indicate that budget 2002 would be presented in October 2001. In my press release of 20 July 2000 announcing the alignment of the income tax year with the calendar year, I indicated that in order to facilitate the change it would be necessary to have an earlier budget day rather than early December as at present.</P>
      <P>There are a number of complicating once-off factors in relation to the implementation of budget 2002. These include the short tax year, the changeover to euro notes and coins and the need to ensure that the Estimates and budget process is tailored to deal with the alignment of the calendar and tax year. Therefore, the Government decided that budget 2002 should be presented to Dáil Éireann on Wednesday, 5 December 2001.</P>

Paragraph 22 of section 1.4 of Framework 1 of the PPF states that &ldquo;The parties to the Programme recognise the necessity to examine issues such as new forms of work organisation embracing innovative work practices, multi-grade and cross stream teams, and flexibility in grading, including broad-banding, complemented by imaginative reward and recognition systems including an examination of gain-sharing. It is also recognised that these issues are likely to arise in any event from the Benchmarking exercise agreed under this Programme.&rdquo; In any event work is ongoing on the development of a performance management system in the public service and without that in place it would be difficult to develop an acceptable gain-sharing scheme for the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ireland all printed books and booklets are zero rated. In the 1998 Finance Act, the rate of VAT on a wide range of printed matter such as newspapers, periodicals, brochures, leaflets etc. were reduced to 12.5% with effect from 1 May 1998. The standard rate of 20% continues to apply to stationery, cheque books, diaries, organisers, yearbooks, planners and similar publications. I am aware that the UK zero rates the supply of most printing services, however it is not possible for us to introduce a new zero rates due to the requirements of EU VAT law which allows us to retain existing zero rates but not introduce new rates. However, Ireland's VAT rate on printing compares favourably with the rates in place in other EU member states. In any event where UK companies supply taxable material into the Irish market they are required to impose the same rates of VAT as comparable Irish firms. Likewise, if Irish companies supply products and services into the UK they are taxable at UK rates.</P>
      <P>Because of their size many Irish printing companies now enjoy the benefits of the 12.5% rate of corporation tax which I brought forward for small and medium enterprises in budget 2000. In this year's budget I increased the thresholds so that companies with a total trading income not exceeding £200,000 can since 1 January 2001 benefit from the 12% rate of corporation tax. Marginal relief applies where the total of such trading income is between £200,000 and £250,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of growth of private sector credit in Ireland and prudential supervision of credit institutions in general is a matter for the Central Bank. For the information of the Deputy some statistics on private sector credit growth in Ireland are given in the following tables. It should be noted that:</P>
      <P>Credit extended to the private sector has been growing significantly for some time, reflecting <i>inter alia</i> increased employment, investment and economic activity generally. The rate of growth has slowed during 2000.</P>
      <P>It is important to keep these growth rates in context. Although private sector credit growth of over 20% was recorded in recent years, the economy has been growing at nominal rates of up to 15% across the same time period.</P>
      <P>The ratio of private sector credit to GDP for Ireland appears to lie in the mid-range for euro-area countries. This is also the case for the ratio of loans to households relative to GDP.</P>

      <P>The Government has not yet completed its consideration of the report. In this context, the report is a lengthy and complex document and contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations regarding public service pensions generally. When I published the report, I noted, in particular, the commission's view that its recommendations as set out in its final report represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of measures as a whole.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, in a press release announcing the publication of the ACC Bank Bill, 2001, I stated that the board of ACC Bank had been mandated to prepare the bank for sale, to pursue all options in relation to a change in the ownership structure of the bank and to initiate appropriate contacts with potential parties. The board has since appointed NCB Corporate Finance, in conjunction with their legal advisers, Matheson Ormsby Prentice, to assist them in this process. I recently appointed A&amp;L Goodbody to provide me with legal advice in relation to the ACC sale process.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Second Stage of the ACC Bank Bill, 2001, took place on 28 March 2001. The Bill provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank. The current limit on Exchequer investment in the bank is £50 million and I propose to increase the authorised share capital to £100 million. This will enable me to subscribe for additional equity share capital should this become necessary to meet ongoing business needs as long as it remains in State ownership. The Bill also includes enabling provisions in relation to the sale of the bank and the establishment of an ESOP for the staff of the bank in line with State guidelines. The terms of the Bill also require me to secure a motion of approval from the Dáil prior to making any disposal of shares, other than to the ESOP or a director of the bank. I hope to see a change in the ownership structure of the bank over the course of the next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;Tobin Tax&rdquo; seeks to impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development.</P>
      <P>While the motives of those seeking to impose such a tax are understandable there is some debate on the theoretical merits of the tax. However, as I have stated in replies to previous parliamentary questions on the matter, leaving aside the issues of theory associated with the proposal, there are still substantial practical difficulties in relation to the tax. These stem largely from enforcement problems. Global co-operation would be required for the tax to become workable. Otherwise, foreign exchange business would gravitate quickly to any country that did not enforce the tax. In this light, the probability of every country in the world applying such a tax, or of one country applying it unilaterally, must be open to question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue was discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 12 January 2000. Officials of my Department attended the meeting. The chairman of the committee acknowledged that Ireland could not act unilaterally in the matter. He also pointed to the practical difficulties that would be caused at EU level by such a tax given that not all EU members are participating in the euro. In the case of this country we also have to be mindful that we have a much higher level of trade and capital flows with currencies outside the euro zone compared to other euro countries. Therefore, the tax would be likely to have a disproportionate impact on Irish business and consumers. Were Ireland to take this matter up at EU level it could be perceived as amounting to a proposal for tax harmonisation, albeit in a discrete area. This might have implications for our overall policy position with <Col N="1411" /> respect to the role of the EU regarding such taxation matters.</P>
    <P>In November 2000, a report commissioned by the Finnish Ministry of Finance examined the feasibility of the &ldquo;Tobin Tax&rdquo;. This report reiterates many of the points which I have outlined above and concluded that introducing a currency transfer tax seems unlikely to further the objectives appealed to by those who argue for it. It would not provide protection against speculative capital movements, it would not make for monetary policy autonomy, and it would not reduce the exchange rate uncertainty. Because the tax base would decrease, the return on the tax would probably be extremely moderate.</P>

      <P>One of the principal functions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. The commission is independent of Government in the exercise of this and its other functions. My main aim in making appointments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission was to select persons of the necessary stature and calibre to manage the fund and who would be seen to be independent of Government in the performance of their functions.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, requires that as far as practicable, the Minister for Finance shall ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the commission. However, in appointing the commission I also had to have regard to the provisions of the Act, which require commissioners to have acquired substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in areas such as accountancy, finance or economics, law or any of the other areas set out in section 7(4) of the Act. In choosing the commissioners I have tried to take account of both these objectives.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, section 7(4) of the Act sets out areas from which commissioners may be chosen. Trade union representation is one of these areas. The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that only persons who have certain expertise and experience may be appointed to the fund. However, the commission is an expert rather than a representative body.</P>

      <P>The term time scheme negotiated with staff representatives allows civil servants to take either ten or 13 weeks unpaid leave from June until the end of August. The purpose of the scheme is to allow working parents or primary carers to match their working arrangements with the main summer holidays of their children, or to care for a person who resides with them and who has a disability which gives rise to the need for care on a continuing or frequent basis.</P>
      <P>Term time is available throughout the civil service from 2001 onwards having previously been available on a pilot basis in a limited number of Departments and offices. The operation of the scheme is subject to the operating requirements of Departments not being adversely affected.</P>
      <P>All Departments have notified their staff about the term time scheme and to date approximately 725 applications to participate in the scheme in 2001 have been received. A small number of applications were withdrawn. A total of 90% of the remaining applications have been approved with decisions still pending in a small number of cases. The Civil Service Commission has recently advertised the for temporary replacement staff in the Dublin region and individual Departments are organising the recruitment of replacement staff elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on the implementation of the 2000 broad economic policy guidelines offers an overall assessment by the European Commission of the implementation of last year's guidelines by member states in 2000. The guidelines for each mem<Col N="1413" /> ber state relate to public finances and labour, product and capital markets.</P>
      <P>The comments on Ireland in the report were broadly favourable. For example, it noted that Irish product markets are generally characterised by a high degree of competition and that Ireland has the highest share of ICT production to total production in the EU. This reflects the presence of many research-intensive foreign-owned firms. In relation to inflation, the report stated that as the influence of special factors unwind, the outlook is for a &ldquo;gentle decline&rdquo; in the inflation rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the national development plan, the report notes that the plan &ldquo;aims to ease capacity constraints through increased investment in physical infrastructure and human capital&rdquo;. The report does note however that &ldquo;given the overriding need to safeguard economic stability and the capacity constraints currently experienced in the construction sector, which lead to increasing implementation costs, there is a strong case for deferring less urgent projects&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the most recent meeting of the Council of European Finance Ministers on 12 March, I made the point that in seeking to better co-ordinate European economic policy we should not rule out reform measures especially where their structural benefits would appear to outweigh any procyclical impact. In my view, the national development plan projects generally are clear examples.</P>

      <P>Ireland's inflation rate as measured by the EU harmonised index of consumer prices remained at 3.9% in the year to February 2001, well down from the peak of 6.0% reached in OctoberNovember 2000. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index, CPI, has developed similarly, with an annual rate of 5.3% to February compared to its November, 2000 high point of 7.0%. As a very open economy our inflation cannot be independent of external developments. However, as indicated at budget time when my Department forecast an average CPI increase this year of 4.5% &ndash; the rate forecast again last week in the Central Bank's spring bulletin &ndash; it is expected that inflation will decline significantly further as the year progresses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the campaign by Jubilee 200 and the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland in favour of the outright cancellation of the unpayable debts of the world's poorest countries. The Government is highly sympathetic to the plight of the heavily indebted poor countries and continues to work for the most generous and flexible application of the HIPC initiative.</P>
      <P>As Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, nor a member of the G8, it is as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to seek to contribute to easing the debt burden of the heavily indebted poor countries, HIPCs, but I am not convinced that a blanket call for total debt relief for all the HIPC countries is feasible at least as far as multilateral debt is concerned.</P>
      <P>The HIPC initiative envisages substantial reductions in both multilateral and bilateral debt and I am heartened by the indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to write-off their bilateral debts. With our co-constituents of Canada and the Caribbean countries we have been pressing for the greatest possible degree of generosity to be shown in order to bring faster and more effective progress on poverty reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, we cannot have a situation where countries that are committed to good governance and tackling poverty are, even after full HIPC relief, still spending a significant proportion of their budget on debt servicing, or more than on their social programmes. In this context I stressed in my speech to the 2000 annual meetings in Prague that the parameters of the HIPC initiative should be kept under review, with a <Col N="1416" /> view to appropriate remedial action where necessary.</P>
    <P>I also indicated to our representatives that a further enhancement of the terms of the HIPC initiative may be required in order that human development indicators are taken into account when calculating debt service sustainability, so that expenditure on social services is assured before any debt service is deemed to be payable.</P>
    <P>While debt has been a significant constraint for many poor countries it is only one element in the development matrix. We should not lose sight of the broader perspective and of the need to underpin development over as wide a front as possible, particularly at a time when total overseas development aid is being constrained. Ireland has been to the fore in recent times in recommitting to the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will continue to work for the maximum possible degree of generosity to be shown toward all HIPC countries and for the HIPC initiative to be implemented so that it achieves it original objective of giving the countries concerned an exit from the burden of unsustainable debt.</P>

      <P>The recent announcement in the UK budget of the abolition of betting tax did not come as a surprise given that there had been much speculation prior to the UK budget that this would happen. The new regime does not come into effect until next year, at the earliest. It is too early to predict what effect, if any, the new UK regime for betting tax will have on betting receipts here. Our provisional betting receipts for January and February 2001 are up by 19% on the receipts for the same period in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are making every effort to explain the changes in the tax system to PAYE taxpayers and to employers.</P>
      <P>Each year at this time the Revenue Commissioners issue notices of tax reliefs to every employee in the country. This year more than two million notices were issued. Although full details are not available, the Revenue Commissioners report that the volume of business in PAYE tax offices is running at roughly last year's levels. Direct contacts with taxpayers in tax offices or on the telephone are taking up slightly more time than last year. This is to be expected but there is some evidence that the postal queries are slightly down in number.</P>
      <P>As is normal at this time of year all tax offices throughout the country assign the maximum possible number of staff to answering telephone calls and to dealing with personal callers. Bearing in mind the huge seasonal peak in the volume of business, it is inevitable that some difficulties will be experienced at certain times by taxpayers trying to make telephone contact with tax offices. Trained staff are now devoted to dealing with queries on the new system. I pay tribute to the tremendous work being done by the Revenue Commissioners' PAYE staff at present. As usual, they are displaying their professionalism and expertise to great effect.</P>
      <P>As regards resources generally, I have approved a significant increase in resources over the past year or so and these are being put in place. On the question of publicity, the Revenue Commissioners have produced a detailed explanatory leaflet for employees, which contains a considerable amount of information to explain the changes in the system. This leaflet was sent to each employee and assessable spouse, in the case of jointly assessed couples. Employees seeking to understand the changes will undoubtedly need to take some time to read the leaflet carefully and, of course, can contact their local PAYE tax office if they have queries. The Revenue Commissioners have also placed a major advertisement in one of the Sunday newspapers to deal with frequently asked questions about the changes.</P>
      <P>In addition, a video and CD-ROM have also been produced explaining the changes necessary in payroll systems. They have issued this to all employers to ensure that they deduct the correct tax from employees from 6 April next.</P>
      <P>The completion of the tax credits system represents a significant change and initially some members of the public may well experience difficulty in coming to grips with the new arrangements. However, I have no doubt that once the public gets used to the system they will recognise it as a major improvement and a fairer system.</P>

      <P>I have no function in regard to the commercial activities of banks, including the location or size of branch networks. I am aware of and appreciate the concerns that can and have arisen at local level as a result of recent and proposed branch closures.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Banking Sector: Some Strategic Issues facing the Irish Banking Sector&rdquo;, published by my Department in August 2000 reviewed this issue and made the following recommendation:</P>
      <P>The banking industry needs to develop a strategy (whether involving agency arrangements with other non-bank retail outlets, electronic arrangements or otherwise) to address the issue of maintaining appropriate mechanisms for and levels of access (in all regions and by the different social groups) to banking services in the context of possible future developments such as Internet banking, closure of branches and rationalisation in the branch banking system. The regulatory authority for the financial services sector should monitor and report on this from a customer perspective.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, since the report of the group, the Government has decided to establish a single regulatory authority, to be called the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, within the structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority. Given the special consumer focus of the new structure, it would be appropriate for the new IFSRA to monitor and report on this issue.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that my Department suggested to the Irish Bankers' Federation that it, as the umbrella organisation for the banking sector, should evaluate industry practice and consider publishing a code of practice. I understand the federation is considering this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the UK has a 5% rate for the installation of energy saving materials and this generally applies to supplies made by installers of energy saving materials, including builders and other businesses, who install energy saving materials either as their main business or as incidental to other activities. The reduced rate does not apply to the purchase of energy saving materials by businesses or purchases for DIY use.</P>
      <P>In our case, our reduced rate of 12.5% applies to energy saving material where supplied by a contractor, provided it complies with the &ldquo;two thirds rule&rdquo;. The reduced rate generally applies where the value of the goods used in providing the service, in effect their cost excluding VAT, is less than the two thirds of the VAT exclusive total charge to the customer. Energy saving materials purchased by private consumers are taxed at the standard rate of 20%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU VAT law allows for up to two reduced rates and one of them must be not less than 5%. We have opted to have only one reduced rate of 12.5%. There would be significant budgetary implications if a 5% rate was introduced. In addition to the immediate cost to the Exchequer in terms of revenue lost on the installation of energy saving materials, the introduction of a 5% rate would give rise to demands from other groups also at the 12.5% rate to benefit from the reduced rate and this would, if all were accepted, have a significant Exchequer cost. I am not convinced that reducing rates of VAT on particular products would assist in the resolution of environ<Col N="1420" /> mental problems. I cannot, therefore, agree to the proposed reduction sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Where taxable businesses install renewable energy saving equipment, such as equipment for a windfarm, any VAT paid on the purchase or installation of such equipment is recoverable by the business under normal VAT rules.</P>

      <P>The 2001 Revised Estimates for Public Services were presented to the Dáil last week &ndash; 29 March 2001. As in previous years, the REV provides for the expenditure measures announced in the budget together with any other adjustments to expenditure which have arisen since the budget.</P>
      <P>This year, the prospect of additional overruns on budget day spending levels arose during the course of preparation of the REV. The most significant factor related to the cost of the measures agreed by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to deal with BSE. Other contributory factors included the Buckley report, additional costs relating to asylum seekers and a wide range of other technical and estimating factors.</P>
      <P>To ensure that aggregate spending remained within the overall limit set at budget day, all Departments were asked to review their programmes in the light of the most up-to-date information available to them and to identify ways in which spending could be reduced.</P>
      <P>In the case of current expenditure, the various measures came to about £200 million and involved a critical review of previous costings which resulted in certain estimated savings, the emergence of higher than projected increases in appropriations-in-aid and further savings arising from the rephasing of existing projects. In the case of capital expenditure, the various measures came to about £300 million and involved estimated savings resulting from a review of up-to-date expenditure profiles, savings arising from an anticipated slowdown on some property acquisitions and savings arising from a rephasing of certain projects.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of the various requests for additional funding and the revised costings which emerged from this review is that the aggregate level of expenditure provided for in the REV is effectively the same as the level set on budget day; it is, in fact, £6 million lower than the budget day level. Overall, there has been an increase of £245 million in current expenditure, £235 million of which is related to BSE measures, and a decrease of £251 million in capital expenditure</P>

The reply does not include internal or interdepartmental committees which are composed exclusively of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council, <Col N="1424" /> NESC, was established in November 1973. Its main tasks are to advise the Government on economic and social development policies. To date, the NESC has published over 100 reports on issues of economic and social policy, industrial policy, housing, social service priorities, agriculture, rural development and emigration. Since the mid-1980s, the council has published a number of strategy reports which have identified inter-related policy measures essential to economic development and the broadening of social inclusion. These reports have formed the basis for negotiation of the national agreements between the Government and the social partners since 1987.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, was originally set up by the Government in 1993 for the purposes of achieving a wider national consensus on social and economic policy initiatives, particularly in relation to unemployment. The forum was reconstituted in 1998 and its remit is now: to monitor and analyse the implementation of specific measures and programmes identified, especially those concerned with the achievement of equality and social inclusion; to do so through consideration of reports prepared by teams comprising the social partners, with appropriate expertise and representatives of relevant Departments and agencies and its own secretariat; with reports to be published by the forum with such comments as may be considered appropriate; and to ensure that the teams compiling such reports take account of the experience of implementing bodies and customers-clients, including regional variations in such experience.</P>
    <P>The role of the National Centre for Partnership, as described in Partnership 2000, was the promotion of a partnership approach in both the public and private sectors through the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, recognising the progress which has been made, proposed a new approach signalled by the new title and role for the National Centre for Partnership and Performance &ndash; NCPP. Following on from this agreement, the NCP ceased to exist with effect from 31 October 2000.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the NCPP will work with IBEC and ICTU in supporting the deepening of partnership including through deliberation, consensus building and dissemination, monitoring, research, analysis, and training and facilitation. This will enable the centre to contribute more effectively to tackling the challenges of ensuring that enterprises, both public and private, are better equipped to adapt to change, including new forms of work organisation, underpinned by effective arrangements of lifelong learning. Preparations for the establishment of the NCPP are well under way. Mr. Peter Cassells has been appointed to the post of executive chairman of the NCPP and is due to take up the post in July. Interviews for the post of the director of the <Col N="1425" /> NCPP were undertaken by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners on 12 March last and it is expected that an appointment will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Established formally on 20 October, 1975 under the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the Law Reform Commission &ndash; LRC &ndash; is an independent statutory body corporate. Its duty is to keep the national law of the State under review and, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to undertake examinations and conduct research with a view to reforming the law and to formulate proposals for law reform. The Commission also examines a particular branch or matter of law when requested to do so by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>On 1 July 1997 the Government established a legislation committee comprising the Government Chief Whip &ndash; chair, the Attorney General, the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, programme manager to the Taoiseach, programme manager to the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Seanad and a representative from the Department of the Taoiseach. The purpose of the committee is to progress the Government's legislation programme through the identification of any blockages which might occur. Prior to the establishment of this committee there was no formal overall co-ordination of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office &ndash; CSO &ndash; was established as a statutory body in the Civil Service under the authority of the Taoiseach by the Statistics Act, 1993. The office collects, compiles and analyses economic and social statistical information. It is also responsible for co-ordinating official statistics produced by other public authorities and for developing the statistical potential of administrative records.</P>
    <P>The National Statistics Board has operated from February 1986 and was placed on a statutory basis on 1 November 1994 under the Statistics Act, 1993. Its function is to guide the strategic direction of the Central Statistics Office, including establishing priorities for the compilation and development of official statistics.</P>
    <P>The National Millennium Committee was established by the Government in November, 1998 to advise it on suitable projects for inclusion in its millennium programme, 1999-2000, and also on a system for supporting commemorative events at local, community, county and regional levels. The overall aim of the millennium programme was to mark the millennium in a dignified, meaningful and lasting manner and in doing so to ensure maximum public participation and to reflect the aspirations of the population.</P>
    <P>The board of MediaLabEurope is responsible for the operation of MediaLabEurope which is a third level research facility which focuses on multimedia, digital content and Internet technologies and which represents a partnership between the Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The board of Digital Media Development Ltd. is responsible for the development of the digital <Col N="1426" /> hub which will be a purpose built environment for digital industries.</P>
    <P>The Information Society Commission was established by Government in May, 1997. Its key role was to shape a public policy framework for the evolving information society in Ireland. The commission's term of office finished at the end of 2000, following publication of its third report. A new information society commission will be appointed by Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The groups IFSC Clearing House Group and its sub-groups, IFSC Banking and Treasury Group, IFSC Funds Management Group and IFSC Insurance Group include members of the relevant Industry sectors and Government Departments, agencies and bodies. The purpose of the groups is to discuss issues of interest to the IFSC and the industry and to increase its competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the commission of inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan and Dundalk bombings are to undertake a thorough examination, involving fact finding and assessment, of all aspects of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and their sequel, including: the facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the bombings; the nature, extent and adequacy of Garda investigation, including the adequacy of co-operation with and from the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland and the adequacy of the handling of scientific analyses of forensic evidence; the reasons why no prosecution took place, including whether and if so, by whom and to what extent the investigations were impeded; and the issues raised by the &ldquo;Hidden Hand&rdquo; television documentary broadcast in 1993. The Dublin-Monaghan bombings refer to the bomb explosions that took place in Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street, Dublin, on 17 May, 1974 and the bomb explosion in North Street, Monaghan, on 17 May, 1974.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Commission of Inquiry into the Dundalk bombing are to undertake a thorough examination, involving fact finding and assessment, of all aspects of the Dundalk bombing and its sequel, including the facts and circumstances of, and the background to, the bombing, having regard to the Garda investigation of the bombing, including the co-operation with and from the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland. The Dundalk bombing refers to the bomb explosion that took place in Dundalk on 19 December, 1975.</P>
    <P>The Quality Customer Service Working Group was set up in late 1999. The group is chaired by Mr. Dermot Quigley, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and its membership includes representation from a number of Departments and offices, Civil Service unions, and business, consumer and equality interests. The QCS working group is charged with progressing the QCS agenda with a view to achieving continuous improvement in customer service by the civil and public service. To date the group has met nine times since 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness provided that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A further independent appraisal of the concept of, and full implications of, a basic income payment for all citizens will be undertaken, taking into account the work of the ESRI, CORI and the Expert Steering group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare and the international research. A broadly based steering group will oversee the study&rdquo;. In pursuance of this commitment a steering group was established under the aegis of this Department. It was not the role of the group to reach a conclusion or make recommendations about basic income. The group commissioned studies from two consultants, which were carried out in two separate phases. Phase I examined the first round or static effects of the introduction of a basic income system in Ireland, while Phase II was designed to take account of the dynamic effects and the long-term sustainability of a basic income scheme, from a broad economic and social perspective. The report of the steering group was published on 2 March, 2001.</P>

      <Quest> her views on the competitiveness of Irish industry; her further views on Ireland's ability to retain competitiveness in the face of much lower labour rates in developing and applicant countries to join the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Lower cost economies in Eastern Europe and Asia have a certain labour cost advantage over Ireland and other European economies. However, recent wage growth in Ireland reflects our economic success and our achievement in improving economic welfare generally. At present, it also reflects a labour market which is nearing full employment, an outstanding achievement when compared with the appallingly high level of unemployment in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, it is misleading to look at wage rates alone as a factor in our ability to retain competitiveness. A key focus of Government policy has been to strengthen overall economic competitiveness which involves a range of actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major feature of the activity of our enterprise agencies has been to re-orientate industry towards higher value added sectors and restructuring in the indigenous and foreign owned industrial base. This has led to a shift in employment into higher productivity sectors thereby maintaining competitiveness. For example, in 1999 Irish productivity per employee per annum was over five times that of the Czech Republic, over four times that of Hungary, and almost three times that of Korea. Moreover, for <Col N="1428" /> the last decade, including the last year, Irish productivity growth has been amongst the highest in the OECD. These characteristics of high productivity levels and productivity growth associated with increasing wages indicate that Irish economic effort is increasingly focused in high value added sectors. For this reason, simple wage comparisons with developing countries and EU applicant countries are not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The accession to the EU of our eastern European neighbours will give rise to increased competition in certain sectors, and for this reason it is imperative that we continue to develop into a high skill, high value added economy. This Government has put policies in place to ensure the achievement of this transition. Furthermore, this dimension is more than balanced by the opportunities which enlargement presents. The single market will expand to over 500 million people and the opportunities for our exporters are obvious. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by the enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>We will continue in this way to focus on factors such as the skills level of the population, the quality of our physical infrastructure, the costs facing business, the services needed by business, the regulatory environment and the effectiveness of public administration. I am confident that determined application of these approaches in the coming period will ensure that the conditions and incentives for enterprise in Ireland will remain favourable, thereby underpinning our competitiveness into the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the Dáil on 30 January 2001 that an arrangement had been agreed between my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda National Immigration Bureau to deal with any future cases where persons arrive in the State with visas obtained on the basis of validly issued work permits but where the jobs in respect of which the permit was issued no longer exist and where the employer in question has made no attempt to notify the Irish authorities prior to the departure of the persons in question. He further indicated that measures to give effect to that arrangement were being put in place.</P>
      <P>Since then further discussions have taken place between the two Departments on the precise nature of the measures in question and on the most efficient mechanism for giving effect to those measures, taking into account the views of the operational staff who are directly involved in their implementation. The element of the arrangement to which her question refers was put in place on 28 March 2001 and since then it has not been necessary to utilise that service, which of its nature should not have to be used frequently.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the measures agreed embody general advice on the necessity for work permits in certain situations and technical advice on the validity of suspected forgeries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents us or our Department from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the motor insurance advisory board, which I established in 1998, is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. The recent release of the board's interim report, under the Freedom of Information Act, has provoked an interesting debate on the statistical basis for the argument put forward by the industry that young drivers in general are a very high risk category. However, it is important to note <Col N="1430" /> that at the time the report was prepared, the board recognised that the data available to it was incomplete. It emphasised that the indications in its interim report could not be regarded as conclusions.</P>
    <P>Discussions between the board and the Irish Insurance Federation have taken place since then and it has recently been agreed that verified data will be provided to the board's statistician very shortly who will undertake a detailed analysis. The board's final report is expected by the end of this year. Both I and the Government await the board's recommendations with great interest. In the light of those recommendations we will consider what further action is appropriate to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently decided to proceed with the main recommendation of the report of the special working group on personal injury compensation. The proposal is to establish on a statutory basis a personal injuries assessment board, commencing its first stage early in 2002, with an initial mandate to address personal injury claims arising from employers' liability insurance and later those relating to motor accidents.</P>

      <P>A number of the agencies under the aegis of my Department are involved in development in the BMW region. These are, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, FÁS and the county enterprise boards. Each of these agencies has regionally based offices focused on development the BMW region. A summary of the remit, budget and responsibilities of these agencies in included below. Further details are available in the agencies' annual reports.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's remit is to win for Ireland the best in international innovation and investment so as to contribute to the continued transformation of Ireland to a world leading society. Over the past year, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs in the BMW region. This objective was achieved during 2000. IDA Ireland's overall budget for 2001 is £189 million, its total staff numbers are currently 295, and its headquarters is located at Wilton Park House, Wilton Place, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland's remit is to help indigenous <Col N="1431" /> client companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to increasing profitable sales, exports and employment. Enterprise Ireland has developed a regional strategy, &ldquo;Driving Growth in Regional Enterprise&rdquo;, designed to achieve balanced regional economic development. Enterprise Ireland's overall budget for 2001 is £287.5 million, its total staff numbers are currently 950, and its headquarters is located at Glasnevin, Dublin 9.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development's remit is to initiate, participate in and support integrated development that will achieve sustained economic growth in the Shannon region. In addition to promoting industrial and tourism development in the mid west region and the Shannon free zone, Shannon Development also promotes the development of indigenous industry in south west Offaly in the BMW region. Shannon Development's overall budget for 2001 is £40.673 million, its total staff numbers are currently 190, and its headquarters is located at Shannon, County Clare.</P>
    <P>FÁS provides a range of services to the Irish labour market, including the provision of training for employment, retraining for employment, management and administration of employment schemes, and facilitating the obtaining of employment by persons seeking employment. FÁS also facilitates the provision of work experience and assists, whether financially or otherwise, local community groups in the provision of employment by means of the establishment or enlargement of local enterprises. FÁS maintains regional offices in each of the counties in the BMW region. The overall budget for FÁS for 2001 is £653 million, its total staff numbers are currently 2,353 and its headquarters is located at Baggot Court, 27/33, Baggot Street, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>There are 35 city and country enterprise boards, 13 of which are located in the BMW region. The remit of the boards is to provide financial assistance to commercially viable projects, develop management skills and provide business information and advice in respect of micro enterprises &ndash; ten employees or less &ndash; at local level. The overall budget for the 35 boards for 2001 is £24.569 million and overall staff numbers are 150. While co-ordination and supervision of the boards is carried out by my Department, each of the boards has an office in its respective county.</P>
    <P>As far as the monitoring process is concerned, Forfás, the agency under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for advising on, and co-ordinating of, industrial policy, is involved in research on policy development relating to issues within the BMW region and co-ordination of the activities of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Forfás is not directly involved in implementing development activities in the region &ndash; that function has been delegated to the enterprise support agencies.</P>
    <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes <Col N="1432" /> under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development programme. Under the plan, the Department and agencies have been set ambitious targets, in particular in relation to the development of the Objective One BMW region. The operational programmes are monitored by their respective monitoring committees. The committees, which include Government Departments, the EU Commission, employers/business representatives, trade unions, farming representatives and the community and voluntary pillar, will meet twice yearly and will prepare annual reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>A special scheme was introduced some years ago, with EU approval, to regularise the position of vessels which, although part of the fishing fleet, had not been formally licensed or registered. It applied only to vessels which had been in the fleet since 1989 and the closing date for applications was February 1995.</P>
      <P>The individual concerned submitted applications for sea fishing boat licences in respect of three vessels in 1999, that is, four years after the deadline. In the circumstances it is not possible to grant licences under the special scheme. The licensing of his vessels must, therefore, be considered in accordance with the standard criteria of licensing policy, including the requirement to remove equivalent capacity from the fishing boat register. Letters offering licences to the applicant, subject to certain conditions, have been issued. To date the applicant has complied with all the conditions except the requirement to remove equivalent capacity.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the objective necessity for pursuing the case for a further limited special scheme with the Commission, in the context of the circumstances of the inshore fisheries sector and overall fleet management policy considerations.</P>

A total of 25% is contributed by the relevant local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As previously stated in my reply on 14 November 2000, I have no direct role in relation to the removal of the derelict tug at Clogherhead Pier, County Louth. The statutory powers and responsibilities which address the removal of wrecked vessels where they pose a threat are contained in the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993. The three key statutory provisions, contained in the Act which govern the removal or rendering harmless of wrecked vessels are section 51(2) which places a responsibility on the owner of a wreck to remove or render it harmless where it is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or to lifeboats engaged in the lifeboat service, or a threat of harm to the marine environment or related interests, which include fishing and tourist activities, which constitute the means of livelihood for persons concerned, and the tourist attractions of any area concerned; section 51(3) which empowers the appropriate authorities, which are defined as harbour authorities, local authorities and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to serve a notice on an owner requiring the owner to remove or render harmless a wreck in these circumstances; and section 52 which also gives the appropriate authorities certain powers to remove or render harmless an offending wreck and to recover the expenses incurred from the relevant person. The relevant person is defined as the owner of the wreck at the time when it sunk or was wrecked, grounded, stranded or abandoned. While harbour authorities' and the Commissioners of Irish Lights' powers to remove a wreck arise only where it is likely to be an obstruction or danger to navigation or lifeboats, local authorities have further discretion to act if the wreck constitutes a threat to the marine environment or to related interests.</P>
      <P>The appropriate authority in this instance is Louth County Council, which has advised that while the vessel is an obstruction to other users of the harbour it cannot be considered a hazard to navigation. They have also advised that Marine Blast Limited, who are the registered owners of the vessel, intend to make an attempt to refloat the vessel in the next four weeks. I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 136 on 20 March 2001 in which I confirmed that I have no plans to alter the balance of statutory representation on the National Salmon Commission at present. I have recently appointed Mr. Joey Murrin as chairperson of the commission. Mr. Murrin was already a member of the commission on the nomination of the Marine Institute. This creates a vacancy for a member of the Commission to be filled on the nomination of the Marine Institute in addition to one other vacancy to be filled on the nomination of the Central Fisheries Board.</P>

      <P>Provision of £600,000 for grant aid towards the cost of a mining museum project at Arigna has been included in my Department's Vote since last year. The project was approved in principle by the Minister for Finance subject to the promoters, Arigna Energy Valley Limited, submitting detailed business plans that showed the viability of the project. As discussed with the company last year, I decided to employ a consultant to assess the viability of the project. The consultant's report was submitted to my Department within the last fortnight. A copy of the report was forwarded for comment to Arigna Energy Valley Limited and when the company's views are received, the grant aid application can be further considered.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for water quality issues is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. However, in pursuance of their statutory remits in relation to the conservation of fisheries, the central and regional fisheries boards have carried water quality surveys on the lakes referred to by the Deputy. The Central Fisheries Board informs me that these surveys shown and overall improvement in Lower Corrib and a slight deterioration in the open water of Upper Corrib, Mask and Carra. Lough Conn showed some deterioration in the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Corrib Plan, financed through the Tourism Angling Measure, the Western Regional Fisheries Board has reviewed the water quality data from 1997 to 2000 in the Corrib catchment. Some localised adverse impacts have been recorded in several rivers within the catchment due to domestic sewage, afforestation and agriculture. There are some specific locations in the lakes where quality is affected adjacent to inflowing rivers. However, there is no evidence of a significant worsening trend overall between 1997 and 2000.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for protection, management, conservation and development of fisheries in Lough Corrib and Lough Mask is a matter for the Western Regional Fisheries Board. The board advises me that a survey of Lough Corrib carried out in 1996 identified a substantial stock of roach in lower Lough Corrib and a moderate stock in upper Lough Corrib. There is no evidence to suggest that this has changed in recent years. In a similar survey carried out in Lough Mask in 1996 only one roach was found which was the first record of this species from the lake. A recent survey has indicated that the number of roach is on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board advises me that currently there is no method of preventing the spread of this non native species within the lakes. The situation will be monitored on an ongoing basis and I have asked the board to keep it under close review. The transfer of live roach from any waters to any other waters is illegal and is prohibited under the <Col N="1450" /> Live Roach Bye-law No. 561, 1973. Responsibility for the enforcement of this bye-law rests with the fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>On 27 March 2001 I appointed an expert task force to advise me on transport logistics in connection with commercial seaports. This is the first time transport logistics will be assessed for our seaports which handle 99% by volume of our imports and exports. As the Deputy will be aware the number one port in the State, Dublin, is increasingly suffering from congestion. Handling a throughput of some 21 million tonnes in 2000 out of a total national ports throughput of 43 million tonnes, it is at the heart of Ireland's transport chain. It is a fact that many ports are located within or in proximity to busy and often congested city and town centres. We need to do everything possible to ease traffic congestion at ports like Dublin and at the other key seaports serving the national and regional economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital for all our major seaports at <Col N="1451" /> Greenore, Drogheda, Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare, Waterford, New Ross, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Galway as well as Dublin that we all work towards achieving a seamless transport chain from road or rail through ports and that we do this in a way that avoids delays, congestion and environmental damage and adds to Irish competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to specifically examine the potential for increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail including the development of rail head facilities at existing ports, transport of freight across transport modes by night-off peak, rail, road and shipping, as well as opportunities for traffic diversion including by rail, by pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms, to other less congested ports outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The group will also seek to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient, cost-effective options for the movement of port related traffic through Dublin and the possibilities for transfer of non essential activities away from ports.</P>
    <P>The task force is chaired by Dr. John Mangan of the Irish Management Institute, an expert in transport logistics and it is fully representative and includes experts from the ports and shipping industries, local authorities, Departments, Iarnróid Éireann as well as the social partners and independent specialists from the transport and other sectors. The task force has invited submissions and representations from interested bodies or people as part of a wide ranging public consultation process. I am anxious that the task force consult widely and take on board the views of all the interested parties especially those who rely on sea transport and the ports industry for their livelihoods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is the regulatory and development authority for the maritime transport sector as well as the governing authority for the State's commercial ports. Sixteen harbour authorities operate under the Harbours Acts, 1946 to 1996, and eight port companies operate under the Harbours Acts, 1996 to 2000. There are different provisions in the governing legislation in respect of property matters. Under the Harbours Act, 1946, a harbour authority may lease any of their lands or premises for any period not exceeding two hundred years, but no such lease shall be made for a period exceeding ten years without the consent of the Minister. In addition a harbour authority may, with the consent of the Minister, sell any of their lands or premises which are not required by them for the purposes of their harbour.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy that in the sale of State lands by harbour authorities, the guidelines set out in the booklet Public Procurement &ndash; 1994 Edition, designed to achieve best obtainable price in an open and equitable process, are observed. Where it is not proposed to dispose of State assets by public tender or auction, or where a public tender or auction process is used and it is proposed not to accept the highest bid, clear reasons for this departure from standard practice must be submitted when seeking ministerial consent.</P>
      <P>The disposal of State properties by port companies is governed by section 15 of the Harbours Act, 1996, which makes provisions with respect to sale, leasing and acquisition of land. It provides that the decision by a company to dispose of any of its land shall only be made by the directors of the company and that the consideration for which any land is sold shall, in so far as is practicable, not be less than its open market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report by the Committee of Public Accounts, following the Committee's examination of the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources on the sale of State lands, made a number of recommendations as to the manner in which the sale of State properties should be conducted and proposed that adequate safeguards be put in place to ensure that guidelines set out in the booklet Public Procurement &ndash; 1994 Edition, designed to achieve best obtainable price in an open and equitable process, are observed. In particular it recommended that in future, where it is not proposed to dispose of State assets by public tender or auction, or where a public tender or auction process is used and it is proposed not to accept the highest bid, clear <Col N="1453" /> reasons for this departure from standard practice should be recorded.</P>
    <P>In order to give effect to the Committee's recommendations, I have informed each port company of my intention to have the guidelines contained in the booklet Public Procurement &ndash; 1994 Edition, applied, where practicable, by the port companies' boards as a matter of policy. My Department has notified each port company of my intention to give such a policy direction in writing. The statutory consultation process as required by section 44(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Harbours Act, 1996, has been initiated.</P>
    <P>The annual report of each port company details all disposals and acquisitions of land in accordance with the memorandum of association of the company.</P>

      <P>Following detailed consideration, it was agreed at the General Affairs Council meeting of 19 and 20 March 2001 that the EU would adopt a common approach to the US-sponsored resolution on the human rights situation in China at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The approach agreed is that, while deciding not to co-sponsor the resolution, EU member states would lobby and vote against the expected procedural no-action motion and EU members of the Commission would vote in favour of the resolution should we be successful in defeating the no-action motion.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging some positive recent developments in China, including the welcome decision to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Ireland, with our EU partners, remains concerned at the human rights situation in China. I attach importance to the EU-China human rights dialogue, which allows joint work towards the promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China. The dialogue is acceptable, however, only if progress is achieved and reflected on the ground. Its results are assessed on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The Presidency at the Commission on Human Rights outlined our concerns in relation to human rights in China in the EU statement under Item 9 on the Question of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in any Part of the World. These include deep concern at the continuing harsh treatment, including excessive sentences and harassment, of democracy activists, religious practitioners and Falun Gong followers, at restrictions on the freedom of expression, assembly, association and religion, at intensified repression and political campaigning in Tibet and Xinjiang, the use of the death penalty and torture, excessive use of administrative detention and violations of the rights of women and children in China.</P>

We believe that the exchange of prisoners by all sides would be an important confidence building measure in the current efforts by the United Nations to achieving a lasting political settlement. The humanitarian situation of the nearly 1,500 prisoners detained by the Polisario in camps in Algeria remains of particular concern. Ireland is actively involved in efforts by the EU and the UN to alleviate their situation and to obtain their release.</P>
      <P>On 13 December 2000, the EU held separate discussions in New York with representatives of Polisario and the Moroccan and Algerian governments on this issue. These discussions were followed by a visit to the camps by EU ambassadors based in Algeria. The EU is currently discussing with the parties, as well as with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, additional measures to address the humanitarian situation.</P>
      <P>The Government welcome the release of 201 captured Moroccans by the Polisario in December last year. We also look forward to the realisation of the Polisario assurances to the UN Secretary General's Special Representative concerning the eventual release of all their prisoners.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As Uganda has striven in recent years to create an enabling environment for development and for the emergence of democracy, Ireland, along with most western donors, has become a committed partner in its development efforts. Since the inception of our aid involvement with Uganda in 1994, Ireland Aid has committed resources to assist with Uganda's economic and social development in a strong aid programme through which we will spend £19 million in 2001 on health, including HIV-AIDS, education, water and sanitation, roads, the productive sector and governance. This budget will be spent in accordance <Col N="1456" /> with a three-year country strategy negotiated with the Ugandan authorities, which is based on an agreed assessment of needs, with an emphasis on poverty reduction and capacity-building.</P>
      <P>The eradication of poverty is the core aim of a partnership approach agreed between the Ugandan government and the donor community. There is significant progress to report. The percentage of the people in Uganda living below the poverty line has fallen from 56% in 1992 to 35% in 2000. This in turn arises from consistent strong economic growth of between 5% and 8% over the last five years.</P>
      <P>I have followed very closely the recent Presidential elections in Uganda and have been receiving regular reports from our Embassy in Kampala. The assessment made by our Embassy and by a wide range of international observers is that the election was imperfect but essentially fair. The observers acknowledged that there were malpractices, some of them serious, in a number of districts, mainly by supporters of President Museveni. However, these were deemed sufficiently restricted not to have altered the overall outcome. In other words, despite the flaws, the outcome of the election is judged to reflect the will of the Ugandan people.</P>
      <P>Governance in poorer countries is itself a developmental issue and, against the background of the chaos from which Uganda has emerged in a little over fifteen years and the general instability in the region, this open election between two strong contestants can be seen as a significant and positive step in the evolution of functioning democracy. The Government is also continuing to closely monitor political developments in Zambia in advance of the forthcoming presidential elections. We hope that the elections will be free and fair and will be conducted in full accordance with the Zambian constitution. It should be borne in mind that Zambia has for many years remained one of Africa's more stable countries, despite being in a very turbulent region. Our development partnership with that country has been one of the most enduring among the six priority countries, and the focus of the Ireland Aid programme on health, including HIV-AIDS, basic education, water and sanitation and urban community development is directly targeted at the estimated 70% of Zambians who live in poverty. As with Uganda, the programme operates on the basis of an agreed assessment of needs, incorporated in a three-year strategy plan formulated in partnership with the Zambian authorities. The programme budget for 2001 is £8.75 million.</P>
      <P>Our strategy is to continue to work with the authorities and people of both Uganda and Zambia with a view to furthering democracy and reducing poverty. In common with all Ireland Aid programmes, our contributions to these countries will be subject to ongoing review with the objective of maximising their effectiveness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 121 to 125, inclusive, and 134 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, believes that any change to the current constitutional situation of Montenegro should be the result of an open, democratic and consultative process and we are working to ensure that this message is clearly received by all the sides involved. It is the hope of the Union <Col N="1458" /> that this process will lead to a new constitutional relationship acceptable to both Montenegro and Serbia within an overall federal framework. Any renegotiation of the federal relationship must be consistent with the internal stability of the FRY and the regional stability of south-eastern Europe. However, I would emphasise that, in the final analysis, any alteration of the status of Montenegro is an internal matter and consequently, a matter for negotiation between the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>With regard to the parliamentary elections in Montenegro on 22 April, Ireland expects the Government of Montenegro to respect democratic principles fully so that the campaign and polling are conducted in a fair and orderly manner in conformity with OSCE standards. These elections are being monitored by the OSCE and Ireland is sending seven observers to Montenegro to participate in the monitoring process.</P>
    <P>The process of economic recovery in Montenegro faces severe challenges. Widely shared problems of transition from state control were exacerbated by the collapse of Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflicts and international isolation. Latterly, the trade blockade imposed by former President Milosevic further separated the economies of Serbia and Montenegro. To the extent possible, international sanctions were targeted in such a way as to minimise their effect on Montenegro, while vital, targeted aid programmes were implemented there. However, Montenegro, along with its neighbours, is very much in a process of reconstruction. Its economy is suffering from crucial deficiencies and very high unemployment.</P>
    <P>The EU is firmly committed to aiding reconstruction and development throughout the former Yugoslavia. At the EU-Balkans summit in Zagreb last November, 4.65 billion was allocated for the period 2000-2006 to a unified assistance programme for the region &ndash; CARDS. This money is being disbursed under regional and country-specific strategies, to maximise its benefit to recipient countries. A strategy document for Montenegro is currently being developed in consultation with other donors and with the authorities there, while ongoing projects continue to receive funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1998, the European Commission has provided assistance of 93.4 million including humanitarian aid, in support of Montenegro's pursuit of political, social and economic reform. <Col N="1459" /> In response to the difficult situation faced by Montenegro, the European Community's contribution under the OBNOVA programme was doubled in 2000 from 10 million to 20 million. The European Commission's development department has also provided food security assistance to Montenegro worth 20.9 million euro since 1998. During 1999 and 2000, the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; provided 27.7 million euro in humanitarian aid to Montenegro.</P>
      <P>ECHO interventions so far have focused on food, including supplementary food, provision of medical supplies, emergency shelter and water and sanitation rehabilitation, support to host families and psycho-social activities. All programmes have been aimed at the most vulnerable among refugees, internally displaced persons, IDPs, and local social cases. Special attention has been given to the large number of Roma IDPs from Kosovo because of their precarious situation and smaller chances of local acceptance and integration. Understanding the importance of releasing beneficiaries from dependence on humanitarian assistance and a need to restore their self-esteem and confidence, ECHO in Montenegro has started supporting some self-reliance and income generating projects. This is in line with the approach of the overall humanitarian community to ensure sustainability of the projects.</P>
      <P>ECHO's interventions are complementary to those of the EC Food Security Programme, which provides assistance to vulnerable groups through targeted financial support to the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in Montenegro. In particular, the programme provides monthly social welfare payments to some 7,000 of the poorest households along with support for redundancy payments and child benefits.</P>
      <P>The European Union's commitment to peace, democracy and stability in the Balkans was underlined when Poul Nielson, the European Commissioner for Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Aid, visited the region in December. The Commissioner held talks with political leaders including President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro and also visited a number of ECHO funded projects in Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro. This gave him an opportunity to meet with local people and learn more about their efforts to rebuild their lives and communities, efforts which Ireland and our EU partners will continue to support. Since 1998, Ireland has allocated over £11 million in bilateral aid to the Balkans region in emergency and rehabilitation assistance.</P>

      <P>Each year, a number of contentious parades in Northern Ireland require the attention of the Parades Commission because of failure to reach agreement between the marchers and local residents. The Orange Order parade in Drumcree on the first Sunday in July is undoubtedly the most high-profile of these parades.</P>
      <P>The continuing disagreements over Drumcree and other contentious parades, and their negative impact on community relations, is a cause of concern to the Government as the start of this year's marching season approaches. We have maintained a consistent approach to the parades question based on mutual respect, dialogue, agreement, the rights of local communities and respect for the law. We have also stressed that the resolution of contentious parades lies through dialogue and local agreement.</P>
      <P>No agreed and mutually-acceptable solution has yet been found to the Drumcree-Garvaghy Road dispute. The Parades Commission has appealed to both sides to commence direct dialogue but, as yet, no agreed talks process has emerged. Last May, an initiative was begun by Brian Currin, a South African lawyer with a background in mediation and currently joint chair of the Sentence Review Commission in Northern Ireland. He was accepted by the parties to the Drumcree dispute as an independent and impartial mediator. While his efforts have not yet met with success, we would encourage all those involved to work with Mr Currin in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>A direct and genuine dialogue between representatives of the local residents group and the Portadown District Lodge would be an important and positive development. The Government is keeping in close contact with the British Government and others to try to ensure an agreed solution to the Drumcree situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 to 131, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to restate my views on the importance of NGOs and missionary orders as one channel of aid delivery. The substantial funding channelled through these organisations, £24.6 million in 1999 and £27.35 million in 2000, that is, approximately 20% of the funds under the direct control of Ireland Aid, constitutes a realistic and regular stream of funding and is indicative of the belief that they are an important channel of aid delivery. The high levels of funding delivered by the Government through NGOs were mentioned by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD as part of its review of Ireland Aid in 1999. A detailed breakdown of individual funding allocations for all NGOs and missionary groups is set out in the Ireland Aid annual reports which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NGOs and missionaries are a valuable means of delivering assistance to the poorest of the poor. However, a key objective in delivering and maintaining a high quality programme of development co-operation is the achievement of a balance, utilising all the channels available to promote sustainable development. This objective requires a clear focus, across all sectors, on the need to build capacity at all levels within developing countries. The emphasis must be on the need to support indigenous ownership and processes within poor countries to ensure that development gains for the poor are real and sustainable. NGOs are a valuable means of delivering aid to the poor, but <Col N="1462" /> important too, especially for sustained and lasting development, are the partnerships between donors and host Governments. These partnerships are the foundations which foster the human and institutional development that are necessary if the developing world is to break out of the cycle of poverty and crisis. The issues of basic needs and associated enabling policies, governance, economic growth and physical infrastructure are dealt with in this partnership framework. Also vital is the role played by multilateral organisations on a whole range of issues from emergency responses to addressing the enormous and unsustainable debt burden faced by so many developing countries.</P>
    <P>The entire aid budget under the control of my Department is voted on by Dáil Éireann. In addition, as I have indicated in previous replies to similar questions, I have ensured that the published Estimates include the specific allocation for block grant assistance, the main NGO co-financing scheme and the local NGO co-financing scheme. The publication of this information contributes to the openness in the management of the aid programme and highlights the developing partnership between Ireland Aid and the NGOs.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to single out individual NGOs, or other aid agencies in terms of effectiveness or administration expenditure. The administration expenditures of aid agencies will vary according to the type of activities in which the organisations are engaged and how they define the term &ldquo;administration&rdquo;. Meaningful comparison of such expenditure must take this into account. The difficulty in the comparison of expenditures is further compounded by differences in accounting for elements of administrative expenditure which are funded by external bodies. What is important is to ensure that administration costs are as lean as possible, but sufficiently realistic to achieve sustainable outputs and lasting outcomes. For example, in emergency situations it is only reasonable that NGOs will have set up costs and reasonable elements of these costs are funded by Ireland Aid.</P>
    <P>In relation to possible corruption and accountability in general, all applications for funding from NGOs, including missionary orders, must conform to a detailed set of criteria and guidelines pertaining to the particular sector being funded. Applicants for funding must demonstrate a capacity to carry out the tasks envisaged as well as a clear and coherent strategy to achieve the aims and objectives of the programme or project. The track record of the applicants in terms of planning, management, monitoring and evaluation is also an important consideration when examining proposed projects and programmes. Applications must be carefully costed in advance. Successful applicants are subject to formal contractual arrangements which set out the terms, conditions and reporting requirements.</P>
    <P>My Department has a separate evaluation and audit unit tasked with ensuring the highest standards of evaluation and audit and the adoption of <Col N="1463" /> best development practice. Independent consultants and international experts are regularly commissioned to assist in the evaluation process. Each year a number of projects and programmes carried out by NGOs are selected for rigorous evaluation and financial audit by Ireland Aid's evaluation and audit unit. NGOs in receipt of public funds must demonstrate that they have a system in place to monitor and evaluate projects and a demonstrated capacity to address issues such as sustainability, participation, local ownership, gender, environmental impact and cost effectiveness. In addition, the evaluation team reports on whether the projects and programmes are performing to expectations, whether the funds are reaching the beneficiaries and whether the projects and programmes funded represent good value for money. In Ireland Aid, evaluation is perceived as a vital tool in learning important development lessons and adopting new and improved ways of bringing about sustainable change in the lives of the poor in the developing world. We must strive to ensure that aid is delivered as productively, effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme of development co-operation is also subject to rigorous peer review by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. As I mentioned earlier, the OECD published its review of the Irish programme in 1999. The OECD review was very positive and stated that Ireland sets very high standards for aid and that there was a clear focus on poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>The review of Ireland Aid, chaired by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Donnell, is under way and will be examining all aspects of the aid programme, including working with NGOs. The review committee has advertised in the national press requesting submissions to its deliberations from interested parties and stakeholders. I hope that there will be a wide response in order that the aid review committee may examine as wide a range of submissions as possible. The committee will also consult with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Ireland Aid began contributing to the UN Population Fund, UNFPA, in 1993. Until then, Ireland was the only member state of the European Union not to support the fund's programmes and activities. This year's contribution of IR£1 million has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has now entered into a multi-annual funding arrangement with the UNFPA as well as with the UN Development Programme, <Col N="1464" /> UNICEF, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Such an arrangement serves to confer a degree of financial predictability, thus enabling the agencies to plan future programmes and strategies. This facilitates effective aid management and helps the process of reform in the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>In the context of the multi-annual funding arrangement, Ireland has given non-binding indicative commitments to UNFPA of IR£1.45 million and IR£2 million for 2002 and 2003 respectively. Ireland's funding of the UNFPA and the other funds and programmes of the UN system takes the form of core contributions. Our voluntary payments are made to the general budget, meaning that they are not earmarked for specific programmes. This is very much in line with the preferences of the UN agencies themselves, as it provides programmatic and budgetary flexibility. This approach avoids oversubscription to high profile or popular programmes while funding for other, equally meritorious programmes goes neglected.</P>
    <P>The UNFPA's work is guided by the programme of action of the international conference on population and development held in Cairo in 1994 and to which Ireland subscribes. The Cairo agreement called on Governments to provide universal access to reproductive health care by 2015 as a global human rights imperative. The conference recognised that meeting individual needs in this regard, enabling couples to choose the number and spacing of their children, would lead to smaller families and early stabilisation of population growth. Our support for the UNFPA, both political and financial, underlines Ireland's commitment to fulfil its international obligations arising out of the Cairo programme of action.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that some half a million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. The money provided by Ireland Aid contributes to the UNFPA's efforts, saves the lives of thousands of women each year and helps prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The US Government recently announced that it was reverting to the so-called Mexico City policy on funding by the US of activities related to health and population. This policy was originally <Col N="1465" /> enacted in 1984 following the Mexico City world population conference. It affects all non-governmental organisations, NGOs, receiving US funds for population assistance in developing countries. US NGOs are required to sign a pledge that no US funds will be given to them if they provide support for any developing country, NGO, or other entity that performs research on, or provides abortion, even if either party uses its own resources. Organisations that do not sign the pledge are ineligible for US funding. President Clinton abolished the original policy in 1993. President Bush has now reinstated it.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, does not receive its funds from the same budget as NGOs and is not therefore affected by the reintroduction of the Mexico City policy. The US will give US$25 million to the UNFPA in 2001 which was appropriated in a Bill that received broad bipartisan support in 2000. A bipartisan Bill is being drafted in the House and Senate on the US contribution to the UNFPA in 2002. It should be noted that the UNFPA does not promote abortion. The Cairo programme of action states that abortion should not be promoted as a method of family planning. The UNFPA fully subscribes to this and does not provide support for abortion services. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1985, stipulates that the UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;. The UNFPA works to prevent abortion through family planning, and to help countries provide services for women suffering from the complications of unsafe abortion.</P>
      <P>Improvements in health and dealing with explosive population growth are essential for sustainable development and poverty eradication. The European Union, as part of its overall programme of development assistance, has extensive activities in the inter-related areas of health, AIDS and population, HAP. Over the past decade, the EU has disbursed over £4 billion on HAP. Family planning is just one, small element of the overall programme.</P>
      <P>The European Commissioner for development, Mr. Poul Nielson, is reported to have been critical of the US decision to reinstate the Mexico City policy. He is further reported to be examining the implications for the Union's funding for HIV-AIDS and population programmes with a view to a possible increase in Union spending in this area. The EU's activities relating to population are governed by the Council resolution of 19 November 1992 on family planning and Council Regulation No. 148/97 of July 1997 on aid for population policies and programmes in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph ten of the resolution recalls the recommendation of the world population conference which states that abortion should in no case be promoted as a method of family planning. Preambular paragraph 12 of the regulation states that &ldquo;when co-operation policies are <Col N="1466" /> implemented, the decision adopted at the Cairo International Conference, according to which abortion can never be promoted as a family planning method, has to be rigorously observed.&rdquo;  Allocations from the EC development co-operation budget to the areas of health, AIDS and population, abide by the provisions of the resolution and the regulation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs appoints four of the eight members of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange, better known as the Fulbright Commission. The remaining four members are appointed by the US ambassador. The commission administers the Fulbright scholarship and fellowship programme between Ireland and the United States of America. It finances studies, research and other educational and cultural activities between Ireland and the United States. It offers grants to Irish postgraduate students and to postdoctoral academic staff to undertake research and-or lecture in the United States, and invites their US equivalents to lecture and to carry out research in Ireland. Support is also given to conferences and other meetings to promote mutual understanding between Ireland and the United States. In addition, there are four agencies-committees under the aegis of the development co-operation division of my Department &ndash; Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC, and the Refugee Agency.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, is a State-sponsored body established in 1973, and incorporated in 1974, to promote and sponsor temporary personal service in developing countries for their economic and social development. Funding for the agency is provided through an annual grant-in-aid from the Department. The Minister appoints the 11 members of APSO's board for periods of three, four and five years.</P>

    <P>The National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, was established in 1994 as a <Col N="1467" /> non-statutory committee to promote and support development education in all sectors of society through co-operation with groups, schools and other institutions involved in development education. Funding for the committee is provided through a grant-in-aid from the Department. The Minister appoints the 17 members of the committee for a three year term of office.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC, was established in 1993. It is a independent committee consisting of voluntary members with a proven expertise or interest in development assistance. The main functions of the committee are to provide the Minister and the Minister of State with policy advice on the effective delivery and future strategies of the Ireland Aid programme.

      <P>The community application of information technology initiative, CAIT, seeks to fund demonstration projects, which encourage and assist those in society who are unfamiliar with, and do not use, the new information and communications technologies in their everyday lives. It is intended that the community and voluntary sector would undertake these projects. Over £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the information society fund over the period April 2001 to November 2002. In excess of 450 proposals were received before the deadline, which expired on 15 February last.</P>
      <P>An application was received from South East Galway IRD prior to the deadline. An independent steering group containing representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, other Departments and the private sector is considering all of these proposals and will make recommendations for funding. The CAIT initiative is just one of many initiatives being undertaken as part of a wider Government programme to ensure a fully inclusive information society in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the research to which Deputy Carey refers is the important recent report entitled, ELF Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer, published on 6 March 2001 by an independent advisory group to the UK's National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB. The main conclusions from this report are that laboratory experiments have provided no good evidence that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are capable of producing cancer, nor do human epidemiological studies suggest that they cause cancer in general. There is, however, some epidemiological evidence that prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency magnetic fields is associated with a small risk of leukaemia in children. In practice, such levels of exposure are seldom encountered by the general public in the UK. In the absence of clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults, or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells, the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children. Unless, however, further research indicates that the finding is due to chance or some currently unrecognised artefact, the possibility remains that intense and prolonged exposures to magnetic fields can increase the risk of leukaemia in children. It is clear from this conclusion that the findings of the report are less dramatic than <Col N="1472" /> some of the headlines that appeared in newspapers at the time of its publication.</P>
      <P>In November 2000 the NRPB stated that 99.6% of children in the UK, the overwhelming majority, live in homes where magnetic field levels are below those that the advisory group finds are associated, in some studies, with a small increase in childhood leukaemia. As it is not the practice in Ireland, as it is in the UK, to permit the construction of homes under electricity transmission lines, or permit new transmission lines to overhang existing houses, there are likely to be very few, if any, children here experiencing the prolonged and intense exposures which concern the NRPB's advisory group. I welcome the NRPB report on electromagnetic fields and shall continue to have all developments in this area closely monitored.</P>

      <P>A tender competition for the appointment of selling agents for the sale of Clancy Barracks was held recently. The tenders are being examined and it is hoped to appoint selling agents in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the military personnel located at the barracks, the military authorities advise that such personnel will be given the option to apply for posting to similar appointments in the new logistics base unit in the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh or to the strength of 2 Eastern Brigade in Dublin. There is no indication as to how many personnel based in Clancy Barracks will opt for transfer to the Curragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to civilian staff at the barracks is that I recently met with both the closure committee and representatives from the joint industrial council for State employees to review progress in the matter of accommodating civilian staff who will be required to move following the closure of the barracks late this year. Of the 91 civilian staff still remaining in the barracks the present position is that upward of 11 are expected to opt for the voluntary early retirement package; 14 will be transferred to other locations in the Dublin area; three have indicated their willing<Col N="1477" /> ness to transfer to the Curragh; 29 have indicated a preference to remain in the Dublin area; 33 have expressed no preference and one staff member will have retired.</P>
    <P>A number of vacancies remain to be filled in the Dublin area and staff at the barracks have been invited to apply for these posts. My Department is in discussions with other Departments and State agencies regarding the possibility of some personnel transferring to those Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998, and which reported to me in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and in-depth study of the reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group.</P>
      <P>The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Defence Force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the Reserve Defence Force is that, in future, members should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject to proper qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by comparable reservists on overseas peace support missions is common in other countries.</P>
      <P>However, the general criteria governing selection for overseas service are issues within the scope of the representation. Therefore, any matters relating to proposals for future overseas service by members of the Reserve Defence Force, which come within the scope of representation, will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. In addition, the question of security of civilian employment, for those members of the force who may wish to serve overseas, will have to be considered.</P>

      <P>It is not intended that the rendered carcases of animals slaughtered as a precautionary measure against foot and mouth disease will be buried in landfill sites. The output of the rendering process will be exported for incineration. In any event the rendering process is more than sufficient to kill the foot and mouth virus.</P>
      <P>However, the carcases of animals slaughtered on the infected farm in Proleek, County Louth, and those slaughtered as a precautionary measure in the Piedmont case were deep buried in quicklime on farm, in consultation with the county engineer, in conditions calculated to present the least risk of spreading foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>These sites will be monitored and I can assure the Deputy that I will adhere to the best veterinary advice in this regard and that every precaution will be taken to ensure that no further risk remains.</P>
      <P>I would also refer to the 1968 UK inquiry report on foot and mouth disease which concluded that burial was preferable to cremation as a precaution to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, inter-farm movement of animals is still considered to be an extremely high risk activity from the point of view of foot and mouth disease and for the immediate future, at least, it will not be possible to allow farmers to re-stock. This issue will continue to be reviewed and I will make adjustments to the existing policy on the basis of the best veterinary advice available and in particular, on the basis of advice from the expert group which I have appointed to review the control measures in place.</P>
      <P>While the current foot an mouth disease controls involve considerable sacrifices for many sectors of society, they are intended to prevent the spread of the disease and the very serious consequences further outbreaks would have for the agricultural sector and for the economy in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently received a submission from the Association of Craft Butchers' of Ireland which, <i>inter alia</i>, seeks to have a task force established to co-ordinate resources of state agencies to support and develop domestic abattoirs. That submission is currently being examined within my Department.</P>
      <P>On the issue of traceability, my Department's CMMS database ensures that only animals whose origin and identification can be clearly vouched for are allowed into the food chain. Furthermore, EU regulations on compulsory beef labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to the final point of sale were introduced last September. I am satisfied that these measures provide consumers both here and abroad with traceability guarantees regarding Irish beef. With regard to sheep, it has been my policy to extend the traceability system to include that sector. While there has been reluctance within the sector to this, recent events have highlighted the need for it and it is my intention to have a system in place in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding abattoirs generally is that, under EU regulations, those slaughtering more than 1,000 livestock units per annum must comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Fresh Meat) Regulations 1997. Small abattoirs with a throughput of less than 1,000 livestock units per annum are derogated from certain requirements of these regulations provided they are licensed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the Abattoirs Act, 1988. These small abattoirs are, however, required to achieve minimum standards regarding, hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. I fully acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach taken by my Department to establishments that have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the regulations. However, given that consumer protection must be our absolute priority, my Department has no option but to refuse to license those premises which are not prepared to achieve the minimum standard required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of financial aid, abattoirs fall within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector. One such provision stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises that comply with existing minimum standards. <Col N="1485" /> Therefore, while it is not possible, nor would it be appropriate, to provide funding to achieve minimum hygiene standards, possibilities do exist for financial aid in circumstances which involve rationalisation, research and development, human resources, training, etc. These possibilities have been discussed with the ACBI and that association was invited some time ago to submit proposals for financial assistance in line with these criteria.</P>
    <P>On the question of animal movement, I have noted in some quarters the suggestion that the closure of small abattoirs and the consequential additional animal movement to larger export plants has been a contributory factor in the spread of foot and mouth disease in the UK. It has not been established that this has been a direct factor in the introduction of the disease to this island. In circumstances where the disease is present in the State, any movement of animals presents a risk. However, we have, in Ireland, taken appropriate precautions since the confirmation of the first foot and mouth disease outbreak in Great Britain to prohibit the movement of susceptible species, except under permit. To date such permits are issued only when the animals in question are moving directly to slaughter or, in certain exceptional circumstances, most notably for welfare reasons. In County Louth, permits are not being issued and animals are being moved for depopulation purposes only.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, animal movement will continue to be a feature of Irish agriculture for the foreseeable future, and for so long as we continue to export beef, movements to a relatively small number of large export premises will still be required. In these circumstances it is essential that the suitable arrangements are in place for animal identification and traceability and I have already described the arrangements I am making in that regard.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension. While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three-year scheme of compensation. Full compensation was paid in 2000 for reductions in payments during 1999. Compensation for reductions during 2000 was set at 75% and was paid to scheme participants at the end of March. Arrangements for the third and final compensation payment have yet to be determined.</P>

      <P>Due to staff shortages in the local office of my Department in Dungarvan it was not possible to carry out a final inspection of the investment works of the person under the national farm pollution scheme prior to 22 February 2001. On 22 February all farm visits by officials of my Department were banned as result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK. The question of carrying out farm visits has been considered, along with the other foot and mouth restrictions, by an expert group. The advice of this group to date remains that visits to farms continue to be a high risk activity and that for the present only visits deemed to be absolutely necessary should take place. On that basis it is not proposed to carry out any farm visits to inspect completed works. However, the position is being kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>In the national interest and as a necessary control measure against the spread of foot and mouth disease, FMD, my Department sought the co-operation of the AI industry and requested the suspension of all AI services. I am aware that this, as well as many other necessary measures taken, is causing problems for AI organisations and their employees-contractors as well as the farmers who would normally avail of their services at this time <Col N="1493" /> of year. I am satisfied, however, that as of now it would not be safe to recommend a full resumption of the services concerned. The overall position on FMD and the real threat it poses to Irish agriculture and our economy remains serious. The risks and potentially disastrous consequences involved in relaxing restrictions in key areas too early cannot be overstated.</P>
      <P>The nature of the AI service is that it involves extensive farm to farm contact, which is the highest risk category and any resumption must take that into account. The easing of the restriction on the AI service is, however, under active consideration and taking into account the advice of the expert committee on foot and mouth restrictions, I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter shortly. Any resumption will be on the basis of strict guidelines to be adhered to by operatives involved.</P>
      <P>As regards the milk quota arrangements, I have already announced measures aimed at alleviating some of the difficulties for producers affected by the restrictions on movement. I have also announced the delayed start of the 2001 quota restructuring scheme in order to take account of the difficulties arising at present for dairy farmers wishing to sell or buy quota. I am satisfied that the additional quota given to Ireland under Agenda 2000 will be fully utilised during the next quota year.</P>

    <P>*There was an increase of £2,713 million in the nominal value of the debt in 1999 as a result of the bond exchange programme. Under the programme which was introduced to improve the competitiveness of Irish bonds in the post-EMU trading environment, investors were offered the opportunity to exchange old bonds for new bonds which had coupons close to market rates and technical conventions analogous to those in other EU markets. This increase in debt will, however, be compensated for by a reduction in debt service costs as lower coupons are paid on the increased amount of debt. In other words, the market value of the debt was not affected by the exchange of bonds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> The Deputy should also note that £4,865 million, comprising the net proceeds of the flotation of the former Telecom Éireann and 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000, was set aside for pension pre-funding in the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities. These moneys will be transferred to the national pensions reserve fund shortly.</P>
    <P>The likely national debt figure for end 2002 is dependent on a number of factors of which the most important is the Exchequer balance out-turn for the years 2001 and 2002. The projected general Government debt/GDP ratio for end 2002, as published with Budget 2001, is 28%. This compares with an end 2000 ratio of 39.1%</P>

      <P>The total amount of tax outstanding at 31 May 2000, <Col N="1496" /> the most recent Appropriation Account figure, was £1,055 million. This was down from £1,167 million in the previous year notwithstanding the significant increase in the total amount of tax that had to be collected in the interim. The following table sets out the breakdown of outstanding taxes as requested by the Deputy over the past five years.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress continues to be made in reducing the overall level of Revenue debt. The debt at 31 May last year represented 6% of annual net tax collection and the scale of the reduction achieved is shown by the fact that the equivalent figure in 1988 was 57% of tax collected. Notwithstanding this good performance, however, the Revenue Commissioners are committed to seeking further reduction through a continued policy of encouraging voluntary compliance while rigorously pursuing outstanding liabilities.</P>
      <P>The table shows that the Revenue Commissioners estimate that £560 million will be collected out of the debt of £1,055 million. This is the most realistic estimate possible based on past experience. It reflects a substantial estimated content of a significant part of the debt especially for older years and also the fact that, even in times of strong economic growth, business failure is still a fact of life and some of the debt will relate to companies which may be insolvent.</P>

      <P>The rent-a-room scheme provides that where a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence, no tax is payable on the rent up to a specified amount. The specified amount for the nine month tax year commencing on 6 April this year is £4,400 and £6,000 for subsequent years. In order to qualify for the relief, it is necessary that the residential premises is situated in the State and is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence during the year. Where a person receives rent which is not taxed by virtue of this section, it will not affect the person's entitlement to mortgage interest relief on the property or the capital gains tax exemption, which is available on the disposal of a principal private residence. Also, a stamp duty clawback will not arise for first time buyers.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that deeds of transfer personally presented for over-the-counter stamping at the Dublin and Cork stamp duty offices are processed at the time of presentation, provided the documentation is correct. The Dublin office also provides a five day processing service for personal customers who do not require the immediate processing of their deeds. On average some 6,000 documents are processed weekly either over-the-counter or by the five day service by the Revenue stamp duty offices. This amounts to 80% of all documents stamped by the stamp offices.  </P>
      <P>The remaining 20% of documents for stamp duty processing are received by post from throughout the country. Arising from the implementation of a new computerised system of stamping an arrears of postal cases awaiting processing developed. At present the time required to process postal cases is in the order of about six to eight weeks. The target period set by Revenue in its business plans for processing postal cases is 20 working days and it expects to be on target by the middle of the year. Priority has been given by Revenue to the elimination of these arrears with additional resources being diverted to the work involved. This has resulted in a significant reduction of the backlog. In addition to the redeployment of resources by Revenue, on 26 January last I announced certain measures, to be included in the Finance Bill, 2001, to remove with immediate effect a range of deeds from a charge to stamp duty. It is anticipated the effect of that will give rise to a significant reduction in the number of deeds that require to be presented to Revenue, thereby, allowing greater staff resources to be available to process deeds that require stamping in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>The River Brosna forms part of the Brosna catchment drainage scheme. Under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 the Commissioners of Public Works are obliged to maintain the works in proper repair and effective condition. The channel through Mullingar is maintained on a regular basis. This involves inspection, mainten<Col N="1500" /> ance of weed traps, channels and bridges. In the last two years all parts of the river in Mullingar have been maintained at least once, with many parts maintained more frequently. In addition, the commissioners propose to commission a study of the flood risk in Mullingar when the current restriction related to the foot and mouth disease has been lifted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains fully committed to the introduction of a new programme of decentralisation over the next few months. It is unfortunate I have not been able to progress this issue quite as quickly as I would have liked, but the reality is I have been heavily involved in a range of very important activities over the past number of months, most recently with the Finance Bill which was only enacted in recent days. I now intend to pursue, with some vigour, my plans for a new programme of decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of preparatory work has been done in my Department over the past year or so in developing proposals, which I intend to finalise for submission to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Decentralisation and thereafter to the Government. In finalising my proposals I will have regard to all of the submissions received by my Department, including those received in respect of Mullingar and Bandon. I will also take into account a number of other factors and views, <Col N="1501" /> including those of the civil service management and the civil and public service unions. I have also had informal discussions on a new programme with my Government colleagues in recent months.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to sound evasive about a final date for a decision, I am not prepared to say definitively when a Government decision will be taken. The scale of the proposed programme and the range of issues and views that need to be taken into account are such that a reasonable period of consideration would be appropriate. I can say, however, it is my firm intention to progress my proposals and I can assure the House of my determination, and that of the Government, to decide on a substantial programme of decentralisation over the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached with the European Commission to allow the application of commercial and industrial incentives to the majority of projects under the town renewal scheme. Details of the new arrangements tailored to meet the Commission's requirements on State aids were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incentives will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, enterprises defined by the EU as having certain characteristics, including a staff of fewer than 250 employees, with either an annual turnover not exceeding 40 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 27 million. The range of projects cleared to proceed from 6 April 2001 following discussions with the European Commission include: all new build SME projects &ndash; such projects will be eligible for both commercial and industrial incentives; and refurbishment projects in the following categories &ndash; SME projects where the expenditure incurred is below 800,000 or £630,051 will qualify for the full range of commercial and industrial incentives, SME projects which involve both expenditure on refurbishment and the provision of an extension where the cost of the extension is at least 25% of the market value of the existing building &ndash; this category will also qualify for commercial and industrial incen<Col N="1502" /> tives, and local retail SME projects, excluding mail order and financial services. Incentives for office and industrial development are, therefore, excluded under this category.</P>
    <P>Projects which qualify under any of the three refurbishment categories outlined above will be eligible under the scheme. Refurbishment projects which do not fall within these categories are the subject of ongoing discussions with the EU Commission. While it is not possible to indicate when these discussions will finally conclude, it is my understanding that the arrangements that have now been agreed will now allow the vast majority of projects planned under the scheme to proceed. In view of the delay in reaching agreement with the Commission on the commencement of the commercial and industrial element of the scheme, the termination date of the scheme has been extended from 31 March 2003 to 31 December 2003.</P>
    <P>Provision to allow the implementation of these arrangements was included on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, in the Dáil. The provision also provided that capital allowances will not apply in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 6 April 2001 on industrial and commercial premises in designated areas under this scheme where any part of that expenditure is met by way of grant assistance from State bodies or elsewhere. This amendment is being made to ensure that the scheme complies with the European Commission's regional aid guidelines for the period to 2006 and similar amendments were made on Committee Stage in respect of the urban and rural renewal schemes.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce the type of arrangement for overseeing implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisaged by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the timely implementation of the national development plan. Particular attention is being paid to delivery of the infrastructure investment in the plan. To this end, special arrangements have been put in place to monitor and drive delivery of this element of the plan. In particular, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development, including public private partnerships, which is chaired by the Taoiseach. A cross departmental team of senior officials supports the Cabinet committee. This institutional structure provides a powerful means for addressing institutional, administrative and legal issues that might hinder deliverability of the NDP. For instance, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, includes provisions developed under the aegis of the Cabinet committee. Better project management in key implementing agencies has also been put into effect, which, for example, will lead to a reduction from five years to three and a half years in the period it takes to progress major road projects from conception to commencement on site. The Cabinet committee also receives regular progress reports from these agencies. In this context and in order to assist the committee's work, my Department has established a detailed NDP project tracking system, which will enable any emerging problems to be quickly identified and remedial action taken.</P>
      <P>In addition, and as required under the Structural Funds regulations, responsibility for overseeing implementation of the NDP Operational Programmes, OPs, rests with the OP managing authorities reporting to the OP monitoring committees. This is being done in way which will mainstream the positive experience of managing and monitoring Structural Funds programmes. The managing authorities for each of the OPs are as follows:</P>

      <Col N="1504" /> The various implementing bodies in each operational programme report physical and financial progress to the managing authority which in turns reports progress and, as appropriate, makes any proposals for reprogramming to the monitoring committee. The monitoring committee is responsible for taking reprogramming decisions in respect of cofinanced expenditure. It may make recommendations in respect of non-cofinanced expenditure. There is also a separate monitoring committee for the NDP/CSF with responsibility for taking decisions across programmes.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committees for the OPs and NDP/CSF comprise, among others, representatives of the managing authorities, Departments, regional authorities, State bodies, each of the pillars of the social partnership and bodies representing the horizontal concerns of equality, poverty, the environment and rural development as well as, in an advisory capacity, the European Commission and the NDP/CSF evaluation and information units. The monitoring committees are an effective expression of public private partnership oversight of the plan.</P>
    <P>As an integral part of its delivery, the plan also provides for the involvement of public private partnerships in the provision of infrastructural projects and these are being successfully developed. Three PPP competitions were initiated in 2000 and five more will be held in the current year. Eight new PPP toll projects have been with tender processes to start in the near future. Moreover, substantial progress has been made on four PPP pilot projects, Waterford bridge and by-pass, Kilcock/Kinnegad by-pass, Limerick southern ring road, phase 2, and the second West-link bridge on the M50. PPP projects are also being developed in environmental services and in the areas of education.</P>
    <P>In addition, a framework for PPPs, which is a commitment of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is near completion and discussions are currently under way on the standardization of PPP contracts, guidance notes and project documentation.</P>

Furthermore, I am advised it would be a complex and lengthy statistical exercise, which would be disproportionate on cost <Col N="1505" /> grounds to the information obtained, to extract information in relation to each individual employer across different sectors of industry by numbers employed .</P>
      <P>Prior to its abolition, the employer PRSI contribution ceiling on employees' earnings was set at £36,600. Therefore, for employees earning up to this amount, which is twice the estimated average industrial wage, the measure to abolish the ceiling will have no effect on the payroll cost to employers. The impact of this change depends on the number of employees earning above this level of income.</P>

      <P>I cannot provide information to the Deputy on the level of credit card fraud as there is no published information series available.

Observations from concerned parties have been considered and additional discussions have been entered into. The Commissioners of Public Works are in the process of preparing responses to all of these observations. Minor alterations to the scheme have also resulted from the observations submitted and the scheme includes channel improvements, channel realignment, bridge replacement and ancillary works such as fencing, spoil treatment, environmental mitigation measures, etc. These alterations are currently being costed and the scheme will be resubmitted, for confirmation to the Minister for Finance in late April-early May 2001.</P>
      <P>The works programme is scheduled to be carried out over a period of six months but the current restrictions in relation to foot and mouth disease preclude the commissioners from determining a start date. If works cannot commence by June this year, environmental constraints may impact on the start date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's economic success in the past number of years has been achieved through our ability to improve our international competitiveness. In 2000 the competitiveness report ranked Ireland as the seventh most competitive economy in the world. Among the key reasons for this high placing are: the substantial investment in education and training over the last three decades; the rad<Col N="1513" /> ical restructuring of the tax system which has improved incentives to work; the promotion of market liberalisation; the implementation of the terms of successive national agreements.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to ensuring our economy remains competitive in the broadest sense of that word. This, in turn, will encourage foreign countries to invest in Ireland and contribute to the development of our economy. While the slowdown in the US economy may affect the amount of investment from there, the extent of the impact will depend on prospective economic developments in the US and on our continued adherence to the approaches outlined above.</P>
    <P>At European level, EU Heads of State and Government set a strategic goal for Europe for the next decade at the European Council in Lisbon last year, namely, to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Since then the Council of European Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, has held a number of discussions to implement the strategic goal adopted at Lisbon.</P>

      <P>As the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability in the Waterford region is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance, I have forwarded the Deputy's inquiry to the chief executive officer of the board for attention and direct reply to you.</P>
      <P>While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which <Col N="1514" /> may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter, however, for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
    <P>My Department has also engaged Dr Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists, and I am expecting its final report shortly. Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is section 8 of the Finance Act 2001 which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Pharmacy Act, 1962, provides for the keeping of open shop for the dispensing of medical prescriptions and sale of poisons. The legislation does not restrict the ownership of pharmacies but provides that the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions must be under the personal supervision by an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under section 2(3) of the Act. A shop for the sale of poisons must also be under the personal management of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under section 2(3). The European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications In Pharmacy) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 239 of 1987) amended the Pharmacy Act, 1962 by the insertion in section 2 of a new subsection &ndash; subsection 3A &ndash; which further defined an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;. This was further defined in the European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications in Pharmacy) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 330 of 1991). The purpose of S.I. No. 239 of 1987 and S.I. No. 330 of 1991 was to give statutory effect in this country to EEC Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC. These regulations provide for the mutual recognition of qualifications in pharmacy in respect of nationals of member states and include the provision that a pharmacy in this State which has been in operation for less than three years shall not be managed or supervised by a pharmacist who qualified in another EC member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attempts were made by the European Com<Col N="1515" /> mission on several occasions to introduce measures which would facilitate the free movement of pharmacists. However, restrictions in most member states on the freedom of pharmacists to open new pharmacies became a major stumbling block to the adoption of any Council directives which would provide for the free movement of pharmacists. Member states that had restrictions on the opening of new pharmacies were unwilling to remove them and other member states, including Ireland, were unwilling to support a measure which would impact unfairly on their own graduates. For example, while Irish graduates would be restricted from opening pharmacies elsewhere, their peers from other member states would not be restricted from opening pharmacies in Ireland and in other countries with no such controls. Eventually, a compromise proposal was worked out which provided for a derogation incorporated in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC which was a derogation from the obligation to recognise EC qualifications in respect of &ldquo;new pharmacies&rdquo; in this case pharmacies which have been in operation for less than three years. Regulations were then made in this country to give statutory effect to the directives and which availed of the derogation concerned. Issues arising from unrestricted pharmacy openings were later addressed in Ireland by the introduction of the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement Regulations), 1996. However, these regulations quickly became the subject of a judicial review and it was decided to defer any change to the regulations dealing with the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 were resolved.</P>
    <P>My view is that the use of the derogation provided for in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC is not a satisfactory solution in the longer term. The derogation provided for and introduced in this country did not impact on the pre-existing arrangements in respect of pharmacy graduates travelling between this country and Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it would be premature to amend the regulations providing for the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 have been resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of health boards in the first instance. Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority received an additional investment of £2.34 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million related to the orthodontic initiative. The ERHA has advised me of the following progress on its proposals in respect of the orthodontic initiative. The appointment of two additional consultant orthodontists is currently in train; a third additional consultant orthodontist post has been approved by my Department and the recruitment process is currently under way; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; interviews to recruit three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards will be held in April with appointments to follow without delay; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and offers of employment have issued; a competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be held shortly; a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards is currently being organised; and the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at St James' Hospital Unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; it will open as soon as this process is completed; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St James' Hospital orthodontic unit will be completed in the next four weeks; and the Northern Area Health Board is currently pro<Col N="1517" /> gressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P>As part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department also approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group has been examining this proposal and hopes to finalise it in the coming weeks; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; and agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin dental hospitals on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists will commence training in October 2001.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me that some patients in category 1 have been waiting up to two years for assessment or treatment, this will be reduced to zero over the coming weeks, and some patients in category 11 have been waiting six years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of hospital services in its functional area. I am advised by the board that the attending consultant obstetrician determines the appropriate care, treatment and duration thereof of mothers and their children based on the clinical and medical condition presenting in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further advised by the board that approximately 2.3 births per day from Monaghan General Hospital and Dundalk County Hospital will be delivered at Cavan and Drogheda and that this number should not have any significant demands <Col N="1518" /> on bed space. With regard to staff availability, I am advised that midwives from both Monaghan General Hospital and Louth County Hospital have been redeployed at both Cavan and Drogheda thereby providing adequate staffing levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221, 232 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>There were two measles related deaths during the year 2000, both of which occurred in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, as there are only two cases involved, it would be inappropriate of me to comment on the particular cases in order to protect the identities of the families concerned. These tragic deaths clearly demonstrate the potential serious consequences of the disease. I therefore urge all parents to ensure their children receive their primary childhood immunisations, which are available free of charge from their family doctor, which will protect them and the wider community against these diseases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 to 231, inclusive, and 238 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to point out that measles is a highly infectious disease. It is not a trivial illness. Approximately one in 15 children with measles suffer serious complications. Serious cases require urgent hospitalisation where the average length of stay ranges from five to ten days. Common complications include pneumonia, diarrhoea, croup, malnutrition, otitis media, mouth ulcers and eye complications. Less common complications include acute encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, which may result in permanent brain damage or death. Sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE, is a severe complication of measles, usually ocurring years after the infection and which may cause progressive brain degeneration leading to intellectual impairment, seizures and eventually death.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested information from the health boards on the issues raised by the Deputy. In the time available the Eastern Regional Health Authority has not provided any information. The other boards have responded, however, all the requested information has not been provided. My Department will write to the boards regarding the outstanding information and this will be provided to the Deputy when it is received.</P>
      <P>The information provided by the health boards is as follows: </P>

    <P>I am concerned that immunisation uptake rates for the primary childhood immunisation programme, and in particular for MMR, are still below the target of 95%, which is required to achieve herd immunity. My Department is in regular contact with the health boards at a senior level about the issues which need to be addressed to meet the target. The health boards are in the process of developing strategies to address the uptake problems on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, a national steering committee has been established which will address a wide range of issues relating to immunisation including the primary childhood immunisation programme. These issues will include identifying and addressing the difficulties which are hampering achievement of the uptake target. MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and I take this opportunity to urge all parents to immunise their children. This will ensure individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

    <P>MMR vaccine was introduced into the national primary childhood immunisation programme in 1988. The national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recommends that MMR vaccine be administered at 15 <Col N="1525" /> months with a booster dose administered at four to five years of age. The use of a second dose of MMR vaccine is considered to improve the control of the diseases and some countries have now managed to interrupt the transmission of the diseases by achieving high vaccination coverage for both doses. The booster dose offers a second opportunity to vaccinate children who have not received the vaccine and offers a second chance to protect those children who fail to seroconvert following a single dose of the vaccine, primary vaccine failures. Primary vaccine failures represent less than 5% of children immunised above the age of 12 months. However, these children can contribute to the maintenance of disease transmission. The second dose of MMR vaccine given at school entry also contributes to the prevention of school outbreaks.</P>
    <P>The current GP delivered primary childhood immunisation programme was introduced in December 1995. Therefore, national immunisation uptake data in respect of MMR vaccine and other primary immunisations for children at two years of age is available from 1998. Detailed information in respect of earlier years is not available for all health boards or for all years concerned. The national MMR uptake rate in respect of children at two years of age since 1998 is as follows:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is the regulat<Col N="1526" /> ory body for human medicines in Ireland. The licensing of vaccines for use in Ireland is therefore a matter for the IMB which must satisfy itself as to the safety and efficacy of vaccines before granting a licence.</P>
    <P>The national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recommends that MMR vaccine be administered to children at 15 months with a booster dose administered at four to five years of age. The IMB recommends that children under 12 months should not normally be given MMR vaccine unless they are at special risk, for example in an outbreak situation, since the presence of maternal antibody may interfere with their ability to respond to the vaccine. The national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland also recommends that when measles outbreaks occur, most susceptible children will be protected by giving MMR vaccine within 72 hours of contact with a case. The younger the infant the lower the likelihood of seroconversion. When immunisation below the age of 12 months is deemed necessary it is recommended that a second dose of vaccine be given at 15 months and a further dose should be given at school entry age. This is in line with the recommendations from other EU member states and the schedule in the US.</P>
    <P>The IMB also advised that children given MMR vaccine before their first birthday should be considered as potentially susceptible to all three diseases and should be revaccinated with two doses of MMR. The purpose of the two dose vaccination schedule is to produce immunity in the proportion of persons who fail to respond immunologically to one or more components of the first dose.</P>
    <P>The international consensus, including the WHO, is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and this is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue.</P>

While sections 26, social reports to the District Court, and 28, appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child and provision for separate representation, of this new Part IV remain to be brought into operation by ministerial order, the recently published national children's strategy states that:</P>
      <P>action will be taken to implement those provisions of the Children Act, 1997, which provide for the protection of children in the court system who are the subject of custody or access disputes between parents. This action will include: the extension to the District Court of the power to order social reports in guardianship, custody and access proceedings; the provision of a guardian ad litem service in such proceedings to represent the interests of children.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the national children's strategy commitments will be co-ordinated by the new National Children's Office which the Government has recently established. The office will report to me in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for children and also to the Cabinet committee on children which held its first meeting on 28 March last.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that since the Government came into office it has invested an additional £90 million in revenue in the child welfare and protection services. This has allowed for very significant improvements in the services and these improvements will continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The filming and scanning of an estimated 21 register entries to provide a data base of images of the pages and the direct scanning and conversion of the printed indexes, to provide a machine readable index began in 1996. This work was initially carried out by civil servants relocated to Roscommon who were assisted by participants in a community employment scheme. In recent months additional civil servants have been <Col N="1530" /> assigned to the project and some staff have been recruited locally on a temporary basis. It is estimated that the work will be substantially completed in 2002, which is a necessary prerequisite to the full decentralisation of the General Register Office.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, this project is part of a wider plan to modernise the registration service. My Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are engaged in the review of the entire registration system, including registration law, the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes needed in the law and structure of registration to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format directly at the point of registration. Consultants have been contracted to assist in this process. The objective is to implement a modern efficient effective and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health services in the Tuam area is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Western Health Board. The board informs me that it envisages a 60-bed community hospital comprising a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing care and the remaining 30 beds made up by direct access beds, rehabilitation / convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. In line with what is generally provided in the board's district hospitals, the service will have a very significant mix of multidisciplinary staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, paramedical as well as other complementary therapists. Coupled with this, the board envisages the Tuam hospital functioning at the hub of a comprehensive outreach service providing home care programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing, home help, as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services will be supported by social support services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important dimension of this service would be its linkage with the acute services, mainly in Galway, but also in Castlebar and Roscommon. This linkage would enable patients to be dis<Col N="1534" /> charged early for convalescence, and would ensure that patients are taken away from their families and communities for the shortest time possible. There would be a very close linkage with private nursing homes so as to give every resident in need of long-stay care a choice as regards placement. The community hospital would open the way for the development of consultant-led outpatient clinics from Galway Regional Hospital and tele-imaging and x-ray services could be developed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the procurement of the existing hospital, the board has appointed an estate agent to conduct negotiations with his counterpart appointed by the Bons Secours Order. These negotiations are in respect of the hospital building and the adjoining lands. As yet, agreement has not been reached on price.</P>
    <P>With regard to the existing out-patient psychiatric service, this will be relocated to alternative facilities in Tuam, when the Bons Secours closes.</P>

      <P>As the provision of services for persons with an intellectual disability in the Limerick region is the responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance, I have forwarded the Deputy's inquiry to the chief executive officer of the board for investigation and direct reply to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
      <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter, however, for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also engaged Dr Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective sup<Col N="1535" /> ply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists, and I am expecting their final report shortly.</P>
    <P>Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001 which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>To contract a valid marriage in the State the parties to the marriage have the capacity to marry each other, freely consent to the marriage and observe the necessary statutory formalities. The requirements for a valid marriage include the following &ndash; both parties to the marriage must be over 18 years of age and each party to the marriage must give at least three months prior written notification of their intention to so marry to the registrar of marriages. A person may apply to the High Court or the Circuit Family Court for an exemption order in relation to these requirements. These requirements apply to all marriages within the State.</P>
      <P>The other additional preliminaries and procedures for the registration of marriage depend on whether the marriage is by a civil ceremony in the office of the registrar of marriages or a religious ceremony. For a marriage to be solemnised in the office of the registrar of marriages both parties must fulfil statutory residence requirements before they can apply to the registrar for a certificate, seven days, or a licence, 15 days. The application procedure involved the personal attendance of one of the parties at the office of the registrar to complete forms and declarations required for the service of notice of marriage on the registrar. Marriage by licence may not take place until the eight day after the notice of marriage is received by the Registrar, while marriage by certificate may not take place until the twenty-second day at the earliest after notice of marriage was received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a couple wish to get married in a religious ceremony they will be expected to comply with the requirements of their church or denomination. Marriage by religious ceremony may be by special licence, episcopal licence, ordinary <Col N="1536" /> ecclesiastical licence, on publication of banns, or by registrars licence and registrars certificate, as set out in the Marriages Acts. A period of residence, within a specified area is required before notice can be served on the minister or licencer for the issue of a licence. The Registration Acts also provide that bishops and the heads of particular denominations may grant a special licence to enable a couple to marry at any place and time.</P>
    <P>If either party to the marriage has been married previously it is necessary for that party to produce either a divorce decree or a death certificate, as appropriate. In the case of a divorce granted by a court outside the State the divorce decree and other information in relation to the domicile(s) of the parties concerned must be provided to enable An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir to determine if the divorce is recognisable under the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, review of orthodontic services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. As a result, funds of £5.3 million have been provided for <Col N="1537" /> orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>This year the Western Health Board, WHB, has received an additional investment of £495,000 for orthodontic services, of which £420,000 is to fund its initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This additional investment will enable the board to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists.</P>
      <P>The WHB has informed me that as of 28 February 2001, its waiting list for orthodontic treatment was 2,093. The board envisages that these measures would mean an additional 600 patients would be seen this year. The board's objective is to reduce the treatment waiting period to not more than 12 months over the next three years.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the four year waiting list for orthodontic treatment and the fact that many parents have to have this treatment carried out privately at extreme cost to themselves, he will make available a refund to parents of children over two years on the waiting list who have had orthodontic treatment carried out privately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of health boards in the first instance. There is no provision to refund the cost of private orthodontic treatment obtained by a patient independent of their health board. Such persons may be eligible for income tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card <Col N="1538" /> holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group has been examining this proposal and hope to finalise it in the coming weeks.</P>

    <P>The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland. The control of infectious diseases is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The report of the working party on tuberculosis, which had been established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland and to make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report made recommendations for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations covered a range of issues, including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management, and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis and it is developing such a strategy at present. It continues to review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, are a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, including those with autism, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
      <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter however for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the services in their region might undertake to facilitate this access. I have asked the two boards mentioned by the Deputy for details of the measures which they have taken, and will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as I receive it.</P>
      <P>My Department has also engaged Dr Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists, and I am expecting their final report shortly.</P>
      <P>Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is Section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, which amends Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessments and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

This review involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and will include a detailed assessment of future bed requirements in response to increasing demand and changing demographics. The review is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. In addition, I would also like to point out to the Deputy that under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, this Government is committed to investing £1 billion for the development of acute hospital services including new facilities, re-equipping and additional capacity.</P>
      <P>Private and semi-private beds have in recent years accounted for about 20% of total bed stock in the public hospital system.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds <Col N="1543" /> the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. In the Budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the programme for prosperity and fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the coverage of out-patient costs by the Voluntary Health Insurance board. Under the out-patient scheme, benefits payable are subject to specific limits which were introduced so that the board's liability could be more accurately defined and controlled.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention of the out-patient scheme to try to cover all expenses but to provide an element of benefit where insured persons have incurred large expenses in any particular year. The majority of insured benefits provided by VHI relate to in-patient treatment as this is the area where unforeseen healthcare costs, which are beyond the means of most individuals, generally arise and against which insurance protection is primarily required by consumers.</P>
      <P>In the case of VHI's long-established plans, the excess limit for an individual contract is £250 and for a family contract £400. The VHI applies lower excess amounts in the case of its more recently introduced &ldquo;Options Plans&rdquo;. The application of VHI rules in this regard is essentially an operational matter for VHI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the development of the health insurance market, as stated in the White Paper on private health insurance, the Government considers that the further evolution of private health insurance should include steps to promote the position of primary care in the system. The choice of products in the market is increasing and includes a variety of approaches to benefit payment in respect of the cost of out-patient treat<Col N="1544" /> ment incurred by insured persons. I am aware that the VHI board has been giving consideration to service and product development in a number of areas, including primary care.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276, 286 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The Medical Council is the authority responsible for the provision of registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>The fitness to practise committee of the Medical Council is called upon to consider the conduct of a registered doctor on allegations of professional misconduct and/or unfitness for health reasons to engage in the practice of medicine. Part V of the Medical Practitioners Act, in defining how the committee processes an application for such an inquiry, precludes the Medical Council or the fitness to practise committee from making public any matter concerning a registered medical practitioner that is being addressed.</P>
      <P>Section 45 provides that where a practitioner has been found guilty of professional misconduct and-or unfit to practice following a sworn inquiry, it is open to the Medical Council to make such a finding public and it is the usual practice of the council to do so when all proceedings have been completed. Where no finding has been made of professional misconduct and/or unfitness, the matter may only be made public with the consent of the practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the preparation of a new Medical Practitioners Act is currently under way. This process has involved extensive consultations with interested parties and I expect to be in a position to bring forward draft legislation later this year. Any amendment to the existing Act will examine the composition of the Medical Council to ensure that it equitably balances the interests of the gen<Col N="1545" /> eral public and the medical profession as well as ensuring appropriate openness and transparency in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>A series of meetings have taken place with the Medical Council regarding the preparation of the new Medical Practitioners Act. The dates of these meetings are 28 March 2000, 10 April 2000, 4 May 2000, 1 June 2000, 30 June 2000 and 6 November 2000.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is a statutory body established under the Health Act, 1970. The main function of comhairle is to regulate the number and type of consultant and senior registrar appointments and to specify qualifications for these posts. The board sets its own priorities in accordance with its statutory obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to appointments, the constitution of the comhairle is governed by the Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972, as amended. These regulations provide for a membership of 27, including not less than 14 persons who are registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services. The regulations also stipulate that all per<Col N="1546" /> sons appointed to the comhairle shall be selected for appointment by the Minister for Health and Children. It has been the practice over the years for each Minister to consult with a number of bodies prior to making the final decision on the appointments to the board.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, I consulted with a range of bodies, including all of the health boards, voluntary hospitals, and major organisations such as the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Irish Nurses Organisation, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. As a result, I received a large number of nominations for appointment to the board.</P>
    <P>I considered all of these carefully, having regard to the statutory requirements, the need to achieve a wide geographical spread, the value of representing a large number of consultant specialties, and the need to ensure an appropriate gender balance. In this regard, I am pleased to say that 13 of the 27 appointments made to the board were women, representing 48% of the total.</P>

      <P>The number of persons covered under the GMS scheme at any time, either nationally or in any health board area, varies for a number of reasons. The causal factors accounting for the recent fall in numbers include: economic development and rising employment levels; positive changes in income levels; better management of medical card record systems by health boards to remove persons from the records who have, for example, died; and, importantly, failure on the part of applicants to return relevant information.</P>

This phase of the campaign is now almost complete and preliminary uptake information available from health <Col N="1549" /> boards is positive. Phase two of the campaign commenced recently and will target primary school children as a priority.</P>

      <P>Long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in health board long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the board meets the cost of all of the person's health needs and, thus, the person ceases to qualify for a medical card in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in the Ombudsman's report are currently being comprehensively assessed in my Department. The overall area of funding in relation to the care of the elderly will be debated through the consultative forum in the new health strategy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, a major action plan was announced to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase one of the programme has commenced and is covering the eastern, north eastern and midland health board areas and is targeting 140,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will also be guided by the experience gained from putting phase one of the programme <Col N="1551" /> in place. Phase two will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country and will be implemented as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I would therefore like to clarify for the Deputy that &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo; is the national breast screening programme and that the role of the national forum on cancer services is to advise me on issues relating to the development of cancer services on a national basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to extend medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 and over was announced in the budget last December. Consistent with long established practice and procedure, direct discussions on budget decisions, such as this, do not take place with representative bodies or any party outside of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Irish Medical Organisation would have been well aware of the Government's commitment to improve the position of the elderly both generally and also, specifically, in relation to the health services. In that regard, the three year phased doubling of medical card income eligibility limits for those in the age group <Col N="1552" /> of 70 and over had already signalled Government intention in relation to medical cards and the budget announcement was simply a logical conclusion to that process.</P>
    <P>I met with the IMO at the beginning of March to discuss a number of issues relevant to general practice, including the introduction of automatic medical card eligibility for all persons aged 70 and over. I found the discussion both useful and informative.</P>
    <P>Prior to that meeting, the Health Services Employers' Agency had issued an invitation to the IMO to discuss the agreed implementation of the medical card extension. Currently, the IMO and Health Services Employers' Agency are discussing a number of issues in relation to the GMS in general. The HSEA hopes to be in a position to respond, very shortly, to the IMO's issues in a manner consistent with Government pay policy and the proper long-term development of the Irish health services. That will then facilitate progress on the agreed and timely implementation of the medical card extension.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing. In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. These new schemes, together with the pilot projects, will involve total estimated investment of over £1,000 million, with a potential private finance input of some £700 million, based on user tolls.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Roads Act, 1993, it is a matter for the National Roads Authority to promote the detailed programming of the work required for the NDP and to manage in co-operation with local authorities &ndash; and the private sector in the context of public private partnerships &ndash; the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>

      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires each planning authority to prepare a housing strategy which must assess the overall need for housing within the area covered by the strategy, including the need for social and affordable housing. Under the Act, planning authorities will be able to reserve up to 20% of land zoned in the development plan for residential use, or for a mix of residential and other uses, to meet the identified need for social and affordable housing. The percentage of land to be reserved can be made available to the planning authority at existing use value. Section 98 of the Act also specifies the criteria by which eligibility for affordable housing provided under part five will be assessed.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of housing strategies along with a model housing strategy were issued by my Department in December last. The guidelines set out the factors to be considered by planning authorities in determining the need for social and affordable housing in the preparation of their housing strategies and a methodology for calculating the extent of this need is provided in the model housing strategy. Copies of the guidelines and model housing strategy have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Houses provided by a developer under an agreement reached in accordance with Part V can be sold by a planning authority under the existing affordable housing scheme. These houses will attract the new house grant and may be eligible for a site subsidy of up to £30,000 in major urban areas and up to £25,000 in other areas. A mortgage subsidy of up to £9,000 payable over five years is also available to those on incomes of less than £20,000.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1999, which came into operation on 1 March 2000, provide for the introduction of a form of identification for licensed hackneys consisting of a sign to be displayed on all such vehicles on both the front and rear of the vehicle. The schedule to these regulations details the requirements to be complied with in relation to hackney signs, which were developed following consultation with hackney representatives. The sign must display the word HACKNEY or HACNAÍ, the name of the licensing authority, the vehicle identification mark and the number of the hackney licence granted in respect of the vehicle. The regulations also provide that no sign or advertisement, other than hackney signs, may be displayed on a hackney.</P>
      <P>Subsequent regulations made in August 2000 provide for the introduction of an internal hackney identification which requires the display of information regarding the hackney licence number, the name of the licensing authority, the name, photograph and signature of the driver of the hackney, as well as the serial number of the licence to drive small public service vehicles issued to the driver. The regulations seek to ensure that the public should be able to identify the driver of a hackney at all times.</P>
      <P>The primary reason for the introduction of a limited form of external identification for hackneys was to facilitate enforcement of the public service vehicles regulations by An Garda Síochána. I have no proposals to modify the current sign.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, provides for enabling powers for the imposition of an environmental levy in relation to the supply by retailers, at point of sale, of plastic shopping bags to the public, at an initial level of not more than 15p per bag.</P>
      <P>The detailed modalities of the proposed levy are currently being finalised and will be specified in due course in regulations. However, it is intended that the Revenue Commissioners will be responsible for the collection and enforcement of the levy. In addition, it is intended that there will be a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the proposed levy to customers, and this regulatory provision will be enforceable by local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners will have the necessary powers, equivalent to those available in respect of the implementation and enforcement of relevant taxation measures, to ensure that the proposed levy can be successfully applied.</P>

The funding available to the authority for 2001 is £665.306 million. The NRA headquarters are located in St. Martin's House, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4, and 72 staff are employed by the authority. The NRA reports to my Department on a quarterly basis on financial and physical progress under the national development plan for all projects and funding instruments.</P>
      <P>The NBA was incorporated in 1960 as a private company limited by shares.

The agency is a self-financing organisation which funds its activities from its retained earnings; operating costs for the agency are estimated at £5 million in the current year. The NBA headquarters are located at Richmond Avenue South, Milltown, Dublin 6, and the number of staff on its payroll is 56.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994 transpose the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) into Irish law. The regulations require the provision of collecting systems and secondary treatment facilities for waste water in all sizeable towns, or agglomerations as defined in the regulations by end 2005. The timescale for providing these facilities is governed by the size of the agglomeration and the nature of the receiving waterbody.</P>
      <P>A deadline of 31 December 2000 applied to agglomerations with a population equivalent in excess of 15,000. These include our major cities and towns such as Cork, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford. Projects are well advanced in respect of all of these areas which account for more than 80% of all urban waste water discharges in Ireland.</P>
      <P>For towns with a population equivalent of less than 15,000, a deadline of 31 December 2005 applies as follows: the provision of collecting systems for towns with a population equivalent between 2,000 and 10,000; the provision of secondary treatment for towns with a population equivalent between 2,000 and 10,000 discharging to freshwaters/estuaries, and the provision of collecting systems and secondary treatment for towns with a population equivalent of between 10,000 and 15,000.</P>
      <P>In line with the requirements of the directive, ten inland waters &ndash; six rivers and four lakes &ndash; were identified as sensitive areas. The regulations require that treatment more stringent than secondary treatment, generally referred to as tertiary treatment, be provided by 31 December 1998 in relation to discharges to sensitive waters from agglomerations in excess of 10,000 population equivalent. Tertiary treatment involving phosphorus reduction facilities are now in place in all of these locations. I will be making regulations in the near future to designate further areas as sensitive areas.</P>
      <P>The national development plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; provides for investment of almost £3 billion over the period 2000-2006 on water and waste water infrastructure. The investment includes £728 million to complete the 24 waste water schemes required by the directive by end 2000 and £421 million in respect of 62 additional schemes required by 2005. In July 2000, I announced the first phase of a rolling three-year water services investment programme to cover the period 2000 to 2002 a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The programme will be rolled forward by one year at a time up to the end of the NDP.</P>

      <Quest>the relevant advantages of tertiary sewerage treatment over secondary treatment; and his views on whether secondary sewerage treatment of municipal sewerage and landfill leachate is acceptable prior to discharge into a salmonoid-rated river.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The term secondary treatment of waste water, prior to its discharge to waters, generally means biological treatment to improve the quality of the discharge by reducing the biochemical oxygen demand, the chemical oxygen demand and the level of total suspended solids. Secondary treatment reduces the impact of a discharge on the receiving waters below that of a discharge which is either untreated or subject only to primary treatment. Tertiary treatment further reduces the impact of a discharge by providing for additional treatment more stringent than secondary treatment, including, for example, for the removal of either or both of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus.</P>
      <P>The impact of any discharge is partly determined by the extent of dilution available. Accordingly, where secondary treatment has been applied to a sewage discharge, this would be satisfactory to protect salmonid waters if there is adequate dilution available to reduce phosphorus levels sufficiently to prevent eutrophication. This would have to be assessed on a case by case basis. The standards which apply to designated salmonid waters are set out in the European Communities (Quality of Salmonid Waters) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 293 of 1988). It is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority, where necessary, to adopt an action programme comprising appropriate measures to reduce pollution and ensure that the standards are complied with in relation to any designated salmonid waters in its functional area.</P>
      <P>Landfill leachate is not discharged directly to waters but is usually collected and tankered to a sewage treatment plant where it is mixed with sewage before treatment. Landfill leachate is, therefore, generally, subject to the same treatment and discharge requirements as sewage. The operation of a landfill is subject to licensing by the Environment Protection Agency under the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>The marketing and re-use of asbestos products, including asbestos cement slates, is banned from 1 April 2000 in accordance with national regulations (S.I. No. 107 of 2000) implementing EU Directive 99/77/EEC. The relevant EU and national legislation allows for the retention of asbestos cement slates in the roofs of existing houses until the end of their service life, which is estimated at 50 years or more.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there are no known hazards associated with the retention of asbestos cement slates in roofs. The asbestos content, typically 10%, is well contained in the cement content, 90%, of the slate; and would not be released in hazardous quantities even if the slate was cut or damaged. I am further advised that there is no health protection reason to remove asbestos cement slates from existing houses. If a householder opts to replace such slates, there is no grant assistance available from my Department for this work.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the regulations on the protection of workers involved in the removal of asbestos waste from buildings, structures and installations containing asbestos and would be in a position to advise on this aspect.</P>
      <P>If asbestos cement slates are being replaced, they should be removed intact from roofs. Guidance issued by my Department to local authorities recommends that asbestos cement slate waste should be packaged in strong double-walled plastic sacks, or other containers of equivalent properties, prior to deposit as landfill. The waste should then be deposited at least two metres below the surface.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
      <P>The disability benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 23 September 1999 after he was found capable of work by a medical assessor of the Department. He appealed against the disallowance and he was examined by a different medical assessor who also considered him to be capable of work. His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow disability benefit. The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be reviewed in the light of fresh facts or new evidence.</P>

According to my Department's records, he entered into insurable employment in 1977 and he has a total of 193 paid contributions.

      <P>He applied for a retirement pension at age 65. While his Irish record was insufficient to qualify him for an Irish pension, he qualified for an EU pro-rate retirement pension at the weekly personal rate of £29.50, based upon a combination of his Irish and UK insurance contributions. As this is less than the carer's allowance he is currently receiving and as both payments cannot be paid concurrently, the carer's allowance continues in payment to him.

      <P>Within areas covered by area-based partnerships, applications for back to work enterprise allowance are made to the partnership company for the area concerned.</P>
      <P>In considering applications, partnership companies take account of relevant factors, including the possible displacement of existing businesses. This applies in the case of all proposed enterprises, whether or not they are subject to regulation. The provision of a subsidy for a business which would simply displace an existing viable business would not be justified. The self-employment project submitted by the person concerned was refused on the grounds that, in the view of the partnership company, the enterprise he proposed to pursue carried a risk of displacement of existing business. He was notified accordingly by the partnership company on 19 December 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In Budget 2001, I provided for the maximum rate of widow(er)'s pension to be increased by £10 per week to £95.50 with effect from this month. In addition appropriate adjustments have been made to the means test with extra bands added so that more people will not qualify for the payment. From this month a person with means of up to £98 per week may qualify for a pension.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance, living alone allowance and over 80's allowance are paid as supplements to social welfare payments and are dependent on the applicant being in receipt of one of a number of a specified payments.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to alter this. However, I am concerned as far as possible to improve the position of those who are not receiving social welfare payments but who are dependent on occupational pensions. In budget 2000, I extended the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income or household composition. I extended this provision to people aged 70 and over in Budget 2001. It is expected that this measure will benefit at least 43,000 households from May 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned claimed a widow(er)'s <Col N="1579" /> non-contributory pension in 1999 but was not eligible due to the fact that she had means in excess of the then statutory limit. However, with the improvements I have introduced in this year's budget and the changes in the way capital is assessed for pension purposes, introduced in Budget 2000, I am arranging to have the person's circumstances reviewed as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. There are no exceptions to these conditions on the basis of age and, consequently, people who are over 70 or 75 years of age must also satisfy the means test.</P>
      <P>People who qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension are accepted as satisfying the means test. However, if the household includes a person who is in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or occupational injury benefit then that household will not qualify for a fuel allowance. The benefit recipient could qualify for a £3 smokeless fuel allowance if they are residing in one of the specified areas and are on benefit for more than three months.</P>
      <P>In the case of contributory pensioners such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensioners the income of the qualified adult is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to a fuel allowance. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings-investments of up to £30,000 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare and related systems, whenever possible. The Deputy will be aware that progress is being made in relation to easing the means tests for schemes such as free electricity and for the medical card. At present, the free schemes are not subject to a means test in the case of people aged 75 years or more and the means test for the <Col N="1580" /> free schemes is being abolished for people aged 70 and above from May 2001.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowances to pensioners and am providing an additional £6 million for the scheme this year. The income limit I referred to above will be increased to £40 from October 2001. In addition, the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in the 2001 budget. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>
    <P>Any further changes in eligibility for fuel allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others. It is estimated that it would cost an additional £32.4 million per year to extend the free fuel scheme to all persons over 70 years of age. I would point out that there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent, in the first instance, on the woman qualifying for maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>In order to introduce the extended duration leave it was necessary for the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce regulations to amend the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. These regulations, which required a positive motion of approval to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, were introduced immediately after the Christmas recess. They were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 February 2001 and immediately brought into force.</P>
      <P>Since the extension of the maternity leave provided for in the budget imposes additional obligations on employers, it was necessary to give adequate advance notice and, therefore, retrospective application of the provisions of these regulations was not possible.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the Maternity Protection Act requires that the woman gives her employer at least four weeks notice of her intention to take leave, the extended duration of maternity leave can only apply to women who can give their employers the required four weeks notice following the commencement of the necessary regulations. Consequently, the new arrangements apply to anyone who goes on maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it has not been possible to extend the duration of maternity leave and also maternity benefit by four weeks in the case of women who had already commenced their maternity leave before 8 March 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those generally excluded from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme include people in <Col N="1582" /> full-time employment, people in full-time education, and people involved in trade disputes. The scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The principal is not, and never was, taken into account in the calculation of the mortgage interest supplement because it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>An application for a mortgage interest supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to bodies set up since the present Government took office in July 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the range of the Department's activities there is, at any one time, a range of <Col N="1583" /> working groups, committees, project boards, etc., involved in the many aspects of my Department's business. Many of these are set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to address particular issues and details are not available as to the number and nature of all of these. My Department also has ongoing business liaisons with other Departments and agencies who deliver complementary services.</P>
    <P>The following are details of the relevant bodies established since July 1997 and their aims.</P>
    <P>Comhairle was established in June 2000. It combines the National Social Service Board and certain functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. Comhairle is the national agency responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy services to members of the public, including people with disabilities. Comhairle maintains and distributes comprehensive information on the broad range of social services in a computer-based citizens information database. Comhairle also provides this and other supports to information providers in the voluntary and statutory sectors. In particular, it provides direct support to the national network at about 80 citizens information centres.</P>
    <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy Interdepartmental Policy Committee, which was formally established in April 1997 and is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach, comprises senior civil servants and representatives from relevant State agencies such as FÁS, ADM, and the Combat Poverty Agency, and provides the principal strategic focus for the NAPS.</P>
    <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy review working groups, under the auspices of relevant Departments, are:</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Health &ndash; Department of Health and Children;</P>
    <P>Urban Deprivation &ndash; Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation;</P>
    <P>Housing/Accommodation &ndash; Department of the Environment and Local Government;</P>
    <P>Rural Poverty &ndash; Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development;</P>
    <P>Employment/Unemployment &ndash; Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment;</P>
    <P>Educational Disadvantage &ndash; Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>A network of convenors of these working groups was set up in 2000 and is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach. In addition, an informal advisory committee, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Combat Poverty Agency, has also been established.</P>
    <P>Two cross-departmental groups were established in 1998, one dealing with homelessness and another with literacy among the unemployed. These groups reported to Government in 2000.</P>
    <P>As part of the strategic management initiative, a Civil Service wide series of expenditure reviews was initiated by this Government in July 1997. The review process has twin aims of providing (i) <Col N="1584" /> a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each spending programme and (ii) a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>A joint steering group representative of my Department and the Department of Finance was established to oversee this process within the Department. The steering group monitors progress in relation to the reviews under-way and approves completed reviews for submission to the steering committee, chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for the process on a service-wide basis. The reviews are carried out by working groups comprising of staff representing the policy and executive sections of the Department, the Department of Finance and other Departments or agencies as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Following is a list of reviews included in the expenditure review process:</P>

    <P>The aim of the Departmental Working Group on Joint Custody, which was set up in May 1997, was to look at the way in which joint equal custody arrangements could be accommodated within social welfare schemes, particularly the one-family payment scheme. Issues raised examined in more detail in later reviews.</P>
    <P>The aim of the review of the Working Group on Qualifying Conditions Age Contributory and Retirement Pensions, which commenced in April 1999, was to examine the background to the existing conditions and to examine and cost possible alternative conditions. Proposals in relation to the rationalisation of the pension rate bands and the introduction of the pre-53 pension were introduced in 2000. A more detailed examination of proposals for a review of the homemakers scheme and replacing the average contributions test with one based on total contributions will take place in phase two of the review which got under way recently.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the pension board reporting securing retirement income, on the <Col N="1585" /> national pension policy initiative, in May 1998, a number of interdepartmental working groups were set up to progress the board's recommendations. One such group, the working group on personal retirement and saving accounts &ndash; PRSAs &ndash; operates under the aegis of my Department and involves representatives of the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Pensions. Its main aim is to progress the recommendation to increase Second Pillar coverage via the mechanism of personal retirement savings accounts.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, proposed the introduction of a PRSI carer's benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. A working group was established in my Department to examine the operational details involved in the introduction of a carer's benefit scheme and it included a representative of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The carer's benefit scheme came into operation on 26 October 2000.</P>
    <P>A steering group was set up in December 2000 to oversee a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care is being carried out by Mercer Ltd. The study is examining the strategic issues involved in financing long-term care and it involves an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>The study, which also involves the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public/private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area. it is expected that this study will be completed by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group was established in December 2000 with representation from the social partners and relevant Departments, to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. This will include their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns.</P>
    <P>A working group representative of the Department and the Revenue Commissioners was established in August 1997 to consider the most appropriate means of implementing the Partnership 2000 commitment to reform family income supplement so as to be calculated on a net income basis. The group completed its work in November 1997 and the P2000 commitment was fully implemented on 1 October 1998.</P>
    <P>In line with a commitment contained in Partnership 2000, a consultative group, involving representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments was established in March 1999 to develop cost-effective solutions to the unemploy<Col N="1586" /> ment trap arising from the withdrawal of rent and mortgage interest supplements &ndash; RMIS &ndash; once a person takes up full-time work. Improvements in the RMIS arrangements provided for in Budget 2000 took account of the work of the group which concluded in October 1999.</P>
    <P>A report entitled &ldquo;the Disincentive Effects of Secondary Benefits&rdquo; prepared by Goodbody Economic Consultants was published in March 1999. The purpose of the study, which was commissioned by my Department and overseen by an interdepartmental steering group, was to identify anomalies or inefficiencies in the current arrangements for qualifying for retention of secondary benefits, with particular reference to the effectiveness of the latter arrangements in terms of assisting people to return to or remain in work.</P>
    <P>In line with a recommendation in the report prepared by Goodbody Economic Consultants on the disincentive effects of secondary benefits, a liaison group on secondary benefits and other entitlements comprising representatives of all relevant Departments and FÁS was established in April 2000. The primary aim of the group was to ensure a consistent and co-ordinated development of policy in relation to the retention of secondary benefits and other entitlements. The work of this group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>On the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector, following the publication of a Green Paper on supporting voluntary activity in May 1997, a steering group was established in May 1998 to advise and assist my Department on the consultation process leading up to the publication of the White Paper. An extensive consultation process took place. This led up to a national consultative seminar in March 2000, which subsequently led to the publication of the White Paper in September 2000. Consultancy assistance was required to assist in the analysis of submissions and of the feedback from national/regional seminars, preparation of discussion documents and facilitation of final drafts.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a national committee on volunteering with the long-term aim of devising strategies and actions for supporting volunteering. This committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flood, was launched on 5 December 2000. The committee's primary function is to agree a broad strategy for IYV 2001.</P>
    <P>While my Department is not responsible for the direct management of community-based projects and these projects do not come directly under its aegis, the Department has, since 1990, supported locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion work in their own communities. The supports for locally-based groups involved in community development initiatives in their communities are provided through the community development support programmes: the community develop<Col N="1587" /> ment programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the programme of core-funding to locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>Under each of these programmes funding is provided to locally-based groups on foot of three-year renewable contracts. As part of their contract with the Department funded projects are required to incorporate as companies limited by guarantee.</P>
    <P>Under the community development programme some 130 projects-areas country-wide are in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion in the programme. Expansion of the programme continued in 2000 in line with commitments set out in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>Some 70 projects-areas country-wide were in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion under the family and community services resource centre programme at the end of 2000 with expansion of the programme continuing in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Family.</P>
    <P>Some 40 projects-areas country-wide were in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion in the programme of core funding to locally-based community and family support groups at the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>These programmes are now administered under the community development and family support measure of the National Development Plan, 2000-06. Funding of £110 million has been made available to these programmes over the lifetime of the plan with funding of £17.02 million in 2001 to support these programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department is assisted in formulating policy in relation to the community development programme by an advisory committee representative of the local projects. The Combat Poverty Agency, the regional support agencies, the community workers co-operative and ADM are also represented on the committee. A number of sub-committees, focused on specific issues relevant to programme operate under the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>In addition, a technical group has been established to assist and advise the Minister in the task of selecting new areas and assessing applications for inclusion in the community development support programmes. This group includes representation for funded projects, the Combat Poverty Agency, ADM, and my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to the community development support programmes my Department also administers the money advice and budgeting service which operates nationwide through 50 local projects and two more likely to come on stream in 2001. The service is designed to target families and individuals identified as having problems with debt and moneylending. Each local project is an independent information and service provider, deeply rooted in the local community. Under the programme funding is provided to projects on foot of three-year renewable contracts. As part of <Col N="1588" /> their contract with my Department, funded projects are required to incorporate as companies limited by guarantee.</P>
    <P>My Department is assisted in formulating policy in relation to the money advice and budgeting service by a national advisory committee representative of the local projects. The Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle and a number of other agencies are also represented on the committee. A number of sub-committees, focused on specific issues, relevant to the programme operate under the national advisory committee.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall measures announced under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to assist in the provision of childcare my Department was allocated a sum of £5 million in 2000 to support the development of community-based out-of-school hours childcare services and established an assessment committee, which included representatives of funded projects, ADM, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and other agencies with expertise-involvement in childcare provision, to assess and advise me on applications under the scheme. With effect from 2001, responsibility for funding of out-of-school hours childcare services has been transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>During 2000, my Department established an audit committee. The role of the audit committee is, as part of the ongoing systematic review of the business control and corporate governance procedures within my Department, to oversee and advise on matters relating to the business control and risk management environment, to the operations and development of the internal audit function and to the relationship with external audit.</P>
    <P>The REACH agency was launched in September 2000 with an objective to co-ordinate and progress the development of modern integrated services across the public sector, including the development of an electronic public services broker to act as the gateway for the delivery of electronic services. REACH is a cross-departmental unit reporting to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental steering committee comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children, which Chairs it, the Departments of Finance and Environment and Local Government, the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and REACH has been set up to oversee the civil registration modernisation programme. The programme is being led by a full-time programme director in my Department who reports to the steering committee.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental task force to respond to the foot and mouth crisis in County Louth was established on 23 March 2001 to review the response needed in the area of social welfare and related services to the foot and mouth crisis in <Col N="1589" /> County Louth and to report quickly on the matter.</P>
    <P>Customer panels involve customers meeting representatives from my Department on an informal basis to express their opinions on the service they receive. Such panels have been set up from time to time throughout the Department and provide a useful means of obtaining views and feedback from users of the Department's services.</P>
    <P>My Department jointly operates a business users' panel for employers in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Prior to the transfer in 1996 of the disabled persons' maintenance allowance scheme &ndash; renamed disability allowance &ndash; from the health boards to the Department, a forum of the principal organisations and service providers representing people with disabilities was established to ensure that all aspects and implications of the transfer were discussed. The forum has continued in operation, now meeting on a quarterly basis, and has since been broadened to include issues concerning the invalidity pension and carer's allowance as well as other matters relevant to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A partnership steering committee and a series of regional and local committees have been established in the Department under the terms of Partnership 2000 and, subsequently, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Partnership has the central objective of creating a shared agenda for management, unions and staff.</P>

      <P>Carer's benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The carer's benefit scheme came into operation on 26 October 2000. The principal conditions for receipt of carer's benefit are that a carer must have given up work to care for a person who is need of full time care and attention and that they satisfy certain PRSI conditions.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to carer's benefit is currently being examined. Based on her previous entitlement to carer's allowance she is deemed to satisfy the full time care attention condition for receipt of this benefit. However, certain additional information is required. On receipt of this information her entitlement will be considered further and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department allows health boards to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Payment of ENPs are made at the discretion of the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>ENPs are normally made to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Health boards recognise that confirmation and communion times involve families in additional expense and all boards assist with such costs under this provision. Health boards decide each application on its merits having regard to the income and circumstances of the applicant.</P>

This assessment related to a proposed housing development.</P>
      <P>Quite separately, Sligo Corporation wrote to my Department regarding possible re-zoning of land at Connaughton Road and did not refer to any archaeological assessment having been commissioned by it on the site in question. My Department responded to the corporation on 5 March 2001 on the basis of the information formally submitted by it requesting that an archaeological assessment be carried out on the site prior to the making of a decision on re-zoning. Subsequent to the issue of this letter, Sligo Corporation provided additional information on the archaeological assessment carried out on the site which included a mitigating strategy for the site. Having considered this information, my Department does not now require a further assessment of the site should be carried out.</P>

While it might have been possible to have the Castlecomer Demesne project assessed under the ACCESS scheme, the position is that the closing date for applications was 31 October 2000. Over 170 applications were received for ACCESS funding and the applications are going through a detailed assessment procedure. In those circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to have the Castlecomer Demesne project included for consideration at this stage. It appears from an initial assessment of the project that the plan has a very strong tourism element and the promoters might consider seeking funding under tourism development budgets.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of agencies, etc., set up under the aegis of my Department since I came into office is set out below.</P>
      <P>The Special Area of Conservation Appeals Advisory Board was set up in 1998 to make recommendations to me in cases where landowners object to the inclusion, or exclusion, of their land in proposed special areas of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Burren Consultative Committee was established to offer advice where my Department's functions affect the development of the Burren and to work in co-operation with the management of the Burren National Park and my Department in the development of the national park in a way that recognises the role of local people in the Burren area and encourages a harmonious relationship with the local communities; <Col N="1594" /> acts as a forum to identify opportunities for the communities within the north Clare area, which will accord with the needs of nature conservation and take account of the particularly sensitive character of the Burren National Park and the built heritage, archaeological and architectural, of the north Clare area in general; encourages the harmonious development of towns and villages in the area in keeping with their existing scale and character in order that they may take advantage of development opportunities, including tourism; advises on presentation in the proposed centres supported by my Department; and encourages local knowledge, skills, and techniques in the presentation of the heritage of the Burren.</P>
    <P>The committee may develop plans and proposals for the general development of the Burren. Where such proposals involve responsibilities of Ministers other than myself, I shall facilitate the presentation of these proposals to other Ministers-Departments.</P>
    <P>The film industry strategic review group was set up in 1998 to: carry out an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of the existing State support schemes and incentives to develop the industry; analyse and identify the fundamental issues facing the industry and to make recommendations in regard to future measures in support of the film industry; and formulate a strategic plan for the future of the industry into the next decade. Having presented its report in August 1999 as required, the group was disbanded.</P>
    <P>The Screen Commission of Ireland was established on an operational basis in 1998 to promote Ireland as a location and centre of excellence for film-making. The functions of the commission were brought under the auspices of the Irish Film Board in 2000 following the report of the film industry strategic review group.</P>
    <P>The project management group for digital terrestrial television was established in 2000 to oversee the establishment of the digital terrestrial television platform in Ireland. In addition to representatives from this Department, the project management group includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Wicklow Mountain National Park Council and Killarney National Park Liaison Committee were set up in 2000 to represent the views of the local communities and groups which have a legitimate interest in the management of the Wicklow and Killarney National Parks. The primary task of both groups will be to develop a management plan for their respective parks. Once those plans are finalised the groups will continue to meet regularly to review their ongoing implementation and to further maintain a harmonious relationship between the park and the community.</P>
    <P>The Grand and Royal Canals task force was set up in 1998 to co-ordinate and monitor the activities of the various agencies responsible for developments within the canal corridors in the greater Dublin area, having regard to the recommend<Col N="1595" /> ations contained in the Grand and Royal Canal corridor study reports.</P>

    <P>A steering and monitoring committee in relation to the study of island airstrips and associated services was set up in 2000 to oversee a feasibility study now being carried out on the proposed development and day to day management of island airstrips and associated air services.</P>
    <P>Waterways Ireland, the North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and the supplementary Implementation Bodies Agreement signed in March 1999. It has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>An Foras Teanga, the North-South implementation body for language, was established on 2 December 1999 under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999. The body is comprised of two agencies &ndash; Foras na Gaeilge, which exercises the functions of the body in relation to the Irish language and Tha Boord o' Ulster-Scotch, which exercises the functions of the body in relation to Ullans and Ulster-Scots cultural issues. The body assumed the functions of Bord na Gaeilge, which was dissolved on 1 December 1999, in regard to the promotion of the Irish language. Additional functions were also transferred to the body.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, local committees and other consultative arrangements are established from time to time in relation to the operation and monitoring of local services.</P>

      <P>Mobile patrols include patrol car, patrol van and the district detective unit car. The divisional task force and the drugs unit, Coolock, also patrol the area and checkpoints are operated.</P>
      <P>The school attendance officer, JLO personnel and community policing personnel &ndash; one sergeant and six gardaí &ndash; visit the schools on a regular basis and give school talks and lectures concerning drug related problems, vandalism, public disorder and general crime. They also liaise with the various community voluntary groups and advise them of related problems. The community policing unit has good working relations with the neighbourhood watch schemes in the area and this co-operation has had a positive impact in the fight against crime.</P>

As the Deputy will appreciate, questions relating to the above legislation are matters for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is responsible for all road traffic legislation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 to 360, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>People with Disabilities in Ireland &ndash; PwDI &ndash; Limited is an independent voluntary, non-profit organisation which seeks to represent all people with disabilities through an effective representative structure and to promote self-advocacy of people with disabilities through training, raising awareness and providing information. My Department provides funding to support the operation of PwDI Limited and a sum of £1 million is being allocated to it for these purposes in 2001.</P>
      <P>The development of training materials and similar activities are internal matters for PwDI Limited. Nonetheless, I have made inquiries about possible controversies and have been assured by PwDI Limited that it is unaware of any current controversies of the kind adverted to in Questions Nos. 357 and 358. PwDI Limited has offered to write to the Deputy with details of concerns which were expressed last year in relation to an earlier draft of training materials which I understand have been superseded.</P>
      <P>On 6 January 1999, arising from my concern at the ongoing delays in getting this representative body established, I announced the appointment of a seven person steering group to finalise the preparation of a constitution for a permanent Irish Council of People with Disabilities, to restructure the organisation, to oversee the election of a permanent representative organisation for people with disabilities and to ensure that people with disabilities are empowered to participate in the elections. PwDI Limited was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963 to 1999, as a limited company and registered with the Companies Office on 29 March 2000. A new chief executive officer was appointed in October 2000.</P>
      <P>In accordance with its terms of reference, the steering group brought forward a draft memorandum and articles of association for PwDI Limited, the members of the steering group being the subscribers to the new company. I understand that the memorandum and articles of association were voted upon by the members of PwDI Limited and accepted on 18 June 2000 in Tullamore. The memorandum and articles of association are, in effect, the constitution of that organisation.</P>
      <P>Among other things, the memorandum and articles of association establish a blueprint for an elected representative structure in PwDI Limited. As a result of the adoption of the memorandum and articles of association, elections to network committees were held around the country in late 2000 and early 2001. A few remaining networks have yet to complete their election procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the articles of association for a maximum of 30 network committees and each committee, which has at least ten elected members, may appoint one person to the board of PwDI Limited. It is proposed to hold an induction course for nominees to the new board on 7 April 2001. I understand that the intention is that <Col N="1601" /> within one month of the induction course, the board nominees will be invited to a meeting at which subscribers to the memorandum of association will formally appoint them to the board in accordance with paragraph 54 of the memorandum and articles of association of PwDI Limited. The subscribers will continue to facilitate transition to the new board over a period of approximately three months to enable it to successfully integrate and carry on its work to the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will see, the groundwork has been laid in developing this democratic process for people with disabilities. I look forward to the imminent completion of the process and to the emergence of a vibrant and active representational forum.</P>

      <Quest>the legislative proposals he has to amend section 2(2) of the Bail Act, 1997 in order that a previous conviction of an accused person will be taken more strongly into consideration when deciding whether to refuse bail in accordance with section 2(1) of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 572 of 20 March 2001, where I pointed out that section 2(2) of the Bail Act, 1997, already provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under section 2(1) of the Act, which enables a court to refuse bail if satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious crime, a court must take into account any previous convictions of the accused person.</P>
      <P>The granting of bail in accordance with the provisions of the Act is, as I pointed out to the Deputy, a matter for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. While I am keeping the operation of the Act generally under review, I have no proposals to change the provisions of section 2(2).</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that one garda is attached to Clonark Garda station and will take up residence in the station when renovations to the station have been completed.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; radio communication system is operable between Clonark and the district headquarters in Ballinasloe when Clonark is unmanned.</P>
      <P>Ballinasloe is open 24 hours every day and there are mobile patrols working around the clock. In addition, the divisional traffic corps and district detective branch patrol Clonark Sub-District.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No complaints have been received from the public about the lack of Garda attention. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the value <Col N="1607" /> of fines collected for speeding by camera detection since the inception of this service is not readily available. It would require a considerable amount of Garda time to compile such information which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate could not be justified. As the Deputy may be aware, the gardaí utilise in-car video, mobile video cameras and fixed camera systems for speed detection. The gardaí also use other speed detection equipment such as lasers and radar speed guns for example.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities, however, that in respect of fixed speed cameras, the number of detections from April 2000 to 23 March 2001 was approximately 48,646. A recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General has shown that 84% of these fines are paid without the need to institute court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that in the year 2000, the provisional total for the number of on-the-spot speeding fines issued by the gardaí was 224,264.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are specific legislative provisions applying to family law proceedings &ndash; the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 &ndash; which require the court to hold proceedings otherwise than in public. There is also a general provision in the law which gives the court discretion in other family law proceedings to hold them otherwise than in public and the general practice is to invoke this discretion. My Department continues to keep the law in this area under review.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 report on family courts, the law reform commission affirmed the importance of the right to privacy in family law cases on the basis that they frequently involve detailed discussion of personal relationships. However, the commission recommended that access by a bona fide researcher to such proceedings should be allowed by a judge subject to refusal only on the basis of compelling and stated reasons and that the attendance of students of family law should be allowed at the discretion of the judge. The commission's report was preceded by a consultation paper of 1994. As the Deputy will appreciate, the law reform commission's recommendations fall far short of any major relaxation of the<i> in camera</i> rule, as it is called, for family law proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> In its sixth report, the working group on a courts commission, established to review the operation of the courts, expressed support for the law reform commission's proposal. It stated that a balance should be found between the right of privacy of litigants and children in family law cases and the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice in the area. It also stated that policy reform, research, accountability and provision of adequate services cannot take place without accurate statistics from the courts on a regular basis. With these aims in mind it recommended that a pilot project be established whereby a qualified solicitor or barrister record and report on family law decisions and assemble family court statistics for publication on a regular basis. The reporter or researcher would attend hearings only with the consent of the judge and of the parties and the publication of any identifying material would be prohibited.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has responsibility for <Col N="1609" /> leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. Funding of £250 million was allocated to my Department under the national development plan and was supplemented last October by a further Exchequer allocation of £26.5 million. This funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, 2000-2006. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and childcare places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>Funding measures available, which have been advertised in the national and local press, include capital and staffing grants to community based child care providers and capital grants to self-employed private child care providers.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care section that, to date, there has been no application for funding under any of these measures for a play group in this school. While there is no closing date for the child care grants scheme, funding can only be allocated to groups on receipt of a completed application form and following the assessment and appraisal process. My Department will give due consideration to any application for funding for such a play group.</P>
      <P>In addition to this funding, following a recent decision of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion aimed at streamlining the processing of applications for child care facilities, responsibility for £12.5 million towards schools-based child care initiatives has now transferred to my Department from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Of this, £2.5 million is intended to promote the release of spare classrooms for use as child care facilities. Under this initiative, grants will be made available to schools where the management makes spare classrooms available for the provision of child care. The funding available could cover the refurbishment of the classroom as well as heating or insurance costs. A survey of primary and post-primary schools in relation to this matter was recently carried out by the Department of Education and Science and is currently being examined by Area Development Management Limited in terms of the practicality of the rooms for use as child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The balance of £10 million transferred from the Department of Education and Science will be used to support schools-based after-school hours child care. It is envisaged that £5 million of this will be targeted at schools and communities which experience significant disadvantage while the remaining £5 million will be open to all schools. These initiatives are still in the developmental stage.</P>
      <P>Further details of all child care funding schemes are available from the equal opportunities child care division of my Department, Lo-call 1890 20 90 30.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this Government has committed £250 million to the child care measure under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. In April of this year, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for child care providers under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme staffing grants are available for community-based not for profit groups. As outlined in the general guidelines for the funding measures, applications are assessed according to the following criteria: the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination; and the costing and value for money of the proposal.</P>
      <P>A number of factors are considered in assessing applications including the location of the service, the extent to which it will enhance child care provision in disadvantaged areas, the extent to which the project will maintain or increase the number of places and the extent to which the service will facilitate parents in accessing training, education and employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the community play school in question, an application for a staffing grant was received in my Department's equal opportunities child care section from this facility on 4 December 2000. Following a technical assessment by Area Development Management Limited, the application went before the programme appraisal committee on 22 February 2001. In this case the programme appraisal committee recommended that the project should not be funded on the basis that the application did not rate highly against the criteria of the equal opportunities child care programme. Following consideration of the recommendation of the programme appraisal committee, I made my decision not to approve funding to this application on 7 March 2001 and a letter issued to the group on 8 March 2001 in this regard.</P>
      <P>In making my decision, I requested my Department's equal opportunities child care section to put in place arrangements to discuss, with the management committee of the group, the issues arising from the recommendation of the programme appraisal committee. Officials from my Department's equal opportunities child care section have been in touch with the group and, I understand, a meeting was held on 27 March 2001 between representatives of Area Development Management Limited and the management committee of the group to discuss further the reasons for the refusal of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the group in question is considering submitting an appeal. It is open to any group to submit an appeal or forward further information on an application which would then be considered by the programme appraisal committee. Once the programme appraisal committee <Col N="1615" /> has given due consideration to any additional information or appeal received a recommendation will be made for my approval in the case. In the interim period, it would be premature of me to comment further at this stage.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the Government has allocated £6 million for the BMW region to finance an increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects, which are overseen by my Department in conjunction with the Garda Síochána. The projects are a crime prevention measure which aim, through intervention and prevention, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The projects will be monitored as set out in the plan. In addition, financial monitoring will be carried out in the normal way by the internal audit unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the national development plan for Ireland for a programme to combat crime by addressing social inclusion through employment. The Irish Prison Service element of the programme is called CONNECT 2000-6.</P>
    <P>In the BMW region it is being implemented in Castlerea Prison commencing in the year 2001. The budgeted provision is £2.17 million or 2.75 million for the 2001. Over the course of the national development plan the programme will be introduced to the other prisons in the BMW region &ndash; Loughan House, Mid<Col N="1616" /> lands prison and Portlaoise Prison. The total budgeted provision for the BMW region in this programme is £14.95 million or 18.98 million over the period 2000-6.</P>
    <P>The National Training and Development Institute, a part of the REHAB group, who have a track record in developing work training for socially excluded groups, has been engaged to develop the training programmes for CONNECT and also to perform an outside consultancy role in evaluating the effectiveness of the project. The project will also be subject to the normal monitoring of public expenditure by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department have been allocated £5.972 million under the National Development Plan 2000-6 for the BMW region. The probation and welfare measure is a crime prevention one which proposes to foster a number of specialised and targeted programmes directed at persons referred to the service by the courts or on conditional release from custody.</P>
    <P>The projects will be monitored under the guidelines as set out in the plan. In addition, financial monitoring will be carried out in the normal way by the internal audit unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for offering advice on gender proofing of all policies and programmes funded through the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A new unit has been established within my Department to support this work, the national development plan gender equality unit. The total budget for the unit covering the BMW and southern and eastern regions is £4 million for the period 2000 to 2006. In addition to engaging in training and advisory activities which benefits both regions, the unit is providing funding to a consortium of county development boards in the BMW region to develop a model of training on gender proofing. They are: Roscommon, Donegal, Offaly, Galway, Sligo and Westmeath. An advisory group has been set up to oversee the implementation and outcomes of this training. The unit has a staff of three who are employed full-time: a gender equality expert, an executive officer and a clerical officer. Arrangements to increase the staff complement of the unit are under way.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for an equality for women measure in the BMW region. The measure will fund initiatives under the following strands: the up-skilling and retraining of women employees; encouraging entrepreneurship and career development among women; innovative projects for disadvantaged women and women over 50 years of age; support for the participation of women in decision-making; gender proofing of personnel practices; family friendly arrangements in employment and sharing of family responsibilities; and a research and information campaign for return to work women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> The budget for the measure for the BMW region is £6.1 million over the period 2000-6. There are four departmental staff working on the implementation of this measure and a similar measure for the southern and eastern region: an assistant principal part-time, a higher executive officer full-time, an executive officer part-time and one clerical officer part-time. My Department recently engaged a technical and support service for the two measures for the period February 2001 to February 2004 to advise on project selection and to provide project management support.</P>
    <P>These are new measures. The first four strands will be delivered directly by my Department with the aid of technical support. Last year my Department advertised for project proposals under these strands for the period 2001-2003. The available budget for the BMW region was £1.6 million. The closing date for receipt of applications was 5 January 2001. A total of 126 applications were received from the BMW region involving an estimated expenditure of £25 million. These applications are now being examined. A project appraisal committee comprising representatives of my Department, the BMW and S and E regional assemblies, the Equality Authority and the four pillars of social partnership has been set up to assist with this task. The project appraisal committee will submit recommendations to me for decision.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority, on behalf of my Department, is delivering the strand on gender proofing of personnel policies in both the BMW and S and E regions. Following a tendering process, the authority has set up a panel of experts to carry out the gender equality audits of organisations participating in this initiative.</P>
    <P>A national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise is delivering the family friendly strand under the measure. The national framework committee is an initiative under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The committee is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and comprises representatives of IBEC, ICTU, public sector employers, my Department and the Equality Authority. To date the committee organised family friendly workplace day on 1 March, set up a website and published a brochure on family friendly policies.</P>
    <P>The measure is also funding research on the information needs of women who are seeking to return to the workforce and research to support women in business and management. The measure is also co-funding, with the European Commission, research on reconciling work and family roles with particular reference on how to involve men in family and domestic activities.</P>
    <P>Measures funded under the national development plan are required to meet agreed reporting and monitoring requirements. The progress on the implementation of the measure <Col N="1618" /> will be reported twice a year to the relevant monitoring committee, including details of financial expenditure and performance indicators.</P>
    <P>My Department is also chairing a new committee set up under the national development plan, the Equal Opportunities and Social Inclusion Co-ordinating Committee. This committee will give added support for gender equality, social inclusion and equal opportunities in relation to NDP expenditure, including in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation. As part of the national court service building programme the following capital projects are under way at present in the BMW regions: Carrickmacross courthouse, £0.77 million and Sligo courthouse, £5.9 million.</P>
    <P>Projects recently completed include the refurbishment of Arva courthouse at a cost of £250,000 and Buncrana courthouse at a cost of £450,000.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the costs referred to above are total project costs including fit-out.</P>
    <P>In Monaghan courthouse the space currently occupied by Monaghan County Council is being acquired by the Courts Service and will be developed for court use. At present it is not possible to give a costing for this project.</P>
    <P>Major refurbishment and extension of Dundalk courthouse is due to commence in the immediate future and the estimated total project cost is £8.4 million. Other projects which it is intended to commence later this year include the refurbishment of courthouses in Castlebar at an estimated cost of £10 million, Longford at an estimated cost of £5 million, Boyle at an estimated cost of £1 million, Tubbercurry the estimated cost of which is not available at present and Swinford at an estimated cost of £1.2 million. The Courts Service is also reviewing its accommodation requirements in Donegal with a view to providing comprehensive court facilities for court users.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service is also developing court services in all court offices including the computerisation of court offices in the BMW and other regions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions in relation to the offences of maintenance and champerty over the past decade is not readily available. The information could only be compiled by diverting staff resources from other important work.</P>
      <P>In relation to professional fees, the Deputy will be aware that section 68 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, provides that a solicitor shall not act for a client in connection with any contentious business on the basis that his or her charges are to be calculated as a specified percentage or proportion of any damages that become payable to the client. Any such charges are not recoverable. A contravention of the Solicitors Acts constitutes misconduct on the part of a solicitor for which he or she can be subject to disciplinary proceedings. The code of conduct of the Bar provides that barristers may not accept instructions on condition that payment will be subsequently fixed as a percentage or other proportion of the amount awarded. It is open to a solicitor or barrister to take a case on the basis that his or her ordinary fee will be payable if there is a successful outcome and not otherwise. I am not opposed to this practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the services provided by Legal Aid Board solicitors, I am advised by the board that it does not instruct its law centre staff to refer querists with potential claims for damages to private solicitors.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the value of fines collected for speeding by camera detection since the inception of this service is not readily available. It would require a considerable amount of Garda time to compile such information which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate could not be justified. As the Deputy may be aware, the gardaí utilise in-<Col N="1620" /> car video, mobile video cameras and fixed camera systems for speed detection. The Garda also use other speed detection equipment such as lasers and radar speed guns for example.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities, however, that in respect of fixed speed cameras, the number of detections from April 2000 to 23 March 2001 was approximately 48,646. A recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General has shown that 84% of these fines are paid without the need to institute court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that in the year 2000, the provisional total for the number of on-the-spot speeding fines issued by the Garda was 224,264.</P>

      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting etc.</P>
      <P>I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. An application for a Garda CCTV system in Castlebar is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 396 together.</P>
      <P>The procedures in respect of applications for family reunification from family members of persons in respect of whom a declaration of refugee status is in force are set out in section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
      <P>Section 18 provides that a person who has been recognised as a refugee can apply to the Minister for permission to enable a member of his or her family to enter and reside in the State. The Minister is required to refer such an application to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of investigating the application and submitting a report thereon. This report sets out the relationship between the refugee and the person who is the subject of the application and also deals with the domestic circumstances of the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to there being no objections from the perspective of national security or public policy, where on the basis of the report the Minister is satisfied that the person is a member of the family <Col N="1622" /> of the refugee, the Minister must grant permission to the person to enter and reside in the State. In this context &lsquo;member of the family' is defined as being the spouse of the refugee, the minor unmarried children of the refugee and, where the refugee is under the age of 18, his or her parents.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minster may, at his or her discretion, grant permission to certain other dependent members of the family where those relatives are dependent on the refugee or suffering from a mental or physical handicap to such extent that it is not reasonable for them to maintain themselves fully. The categories of relative to whom this provision applies are set out in section 18(4)(f2&gt;b) of the Act.</P>
    <P>In considering applications which come within this latter provision, the Minister will have regard to the report of the commissioner, any other relevant circumstances of which he is aware and any national security or public policy implications.</P>

    <P>These figures include a dedicated community policing unit comprising one sergeant and ten members of garda rank. The Clondalkin area is also patrolled by a divisional task force, traffic units and district drug units, which had a combined strength, as at 1 March 2001, of 41, all ranks, seven of whom were drawn from Clondalkin Garda station. Moreover, a Garda office has recently been established in Bawnogue. The policing needs of Clondalkin are and will continue to be fully considered within the context of the <Col N="1623" /> overall needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that youth crime accounts for 7% of total crime in the Clondalkin area. There are three Garda juvenile liaison officers allocated to the district, with one Garda sergeant managing the Garda juvenile diversion programme. One Garda juvenile liaison officer is permanently allocated to Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>My Department provides funding for two Garda youth diversion projects in Clondalkin, namely, the GRAFT project in Ronanstown and the SWIFT project in Bawnogue and south-west Clondalkin. The projects aim to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal and-or anti-social activity.</P>
    <P>Funding is also provided, through the probation and welfare service, for the Tower project. This project aims to participate in the development of community sanctions through a programme to reduce the incidence of criminal behaviour and to assist in the personal development of marginalised young people from the north Clondalkin area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the response of the criminal justice system to the incidence of crime and, in particular, youth crime in Clondalkin is appropriate, proportional and yielding positive outcomes.</P>

    <P>Bord Fáilte is currently finalising, in consultation with the industry, a major reassurance tourism marketing campaign to counter the adverse effects of foot and mouth disease on the tourism sector, following discussions which I had recently with both the chairman and the chief executive of Bord Fáilte. The campaign will be <Col N="1625" /> rolled out progressively in line with the best marketing advice and the advice of the expert group on foot and mouth disease controls established by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. The objective of the campaign will be to reassure potential holidaymakers, both at home and abroad, as well as the travel trade, that Ireland is a safe destination which is open for business. It will also emphasise that Ireland continues to offer its traditional warm and friendly welcome to all our visitors, a point which I have highlighted in many recent statements.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is outlined in <Col N="1627" /> the following schedule and relates to all urban and rural areas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Trutz-Haase index was used in the compilation of areas for inclusion in the RAPID programme. The 25 areas designated consist of a number of DEDS, clusters of DEDs, or parts of DEDs, which came within the index, and consist of the 25 areas of greatest concentration of disadvantage in the country. Where necessary, the DED boundaries were adjusted to correspond to local understanding of neighbourhood areas so as to achieve common community focus or to take account of significantly deprived neighbourhoods of local authority residents, especially where these lie in close proximity to, but not within, the boundaries of a DED. All the designated areas are located in the main urban centres.</P>
      <P>A second strand of the RAPID programme, which will be targeted at deprived neighbourhoods in rural areas and provincial towns, is being drawn up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and is scheduled to be operational towards the end of the year.</P>

    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): The tourism, social inclusion and culture, recreation and sports elements of the national development plan, NDP, which are <Col N="1630" /> under the aegis of my Department and are being operated in the Border-midlands-western, BMW, region are as follows: Bord Fáilte will be the implementing body for the tourism product investment scheme, towards which some 100 million of NDP funding has been earmarked for tourism projects in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>The board will be responsible for the monitoring of individual projects and will compile six monthly progress reports for the managing authority, the regional assembly, for submission to the monitoring committee, setting out progress against initial objectives and targets. Bord Fáilte has its headquarters at Baggot Street Bridge, Dublin 2 and its total staffing complement is 239.</P>
    <P>CERT is responsible for three sub-measures under the NDP with expenditure totalling £107 million over the period 2000 to 2006: under measure 12a, CERT will facilitate the transition from second level education to job placement within the tourism industry; under measure 12b, CERT will provide training and employment interventions at national, regional and local level for the unemployed, women returning to paid employment, early school leavers and the socially excluded; and under measure 24f, CERT will facilitate raising and maintaining the highest operational standards in tourism and provide training or development intervention for persons already working in industry. The primary focus will be on human resource management and operational best practice.</P>
    <P>CERT has its headquarters at Amiens Street, Dublin 1 and has a staffing complement of 91.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which was established by the Government in agreement with the European Commission, has <i>inter alia</i> an intermediary role in allocating funding and managing programmes for local partnership companies and community groups in the BMW region. An amount of £15.75 million is provided in the Vote of my Department for 2001 to meet the cost of these programmes.</P>
    <P>The NDP provides that the overall monitoring of these programmes will be carried out by the regional assembly with input from ADM and this Department as appropriate. ADM company's headquarters is in Holles Street, Dublin and it has a total staff complement of 85.</P>
    <P>Under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP, a sum of £26 million has been specifically allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-06 in the BMW region. These facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities and, where appropriate, voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading sports and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled <Col N="1631" /> for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>
    <P>The Department is a member of the BMW regional operational programme monitoring committee which has responsibility for overseeing the overall operation of the BMW regional operational programme.</P>

      <P>At the inaugural meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format held in Belfast on 27 October 2000, the Council agreed to the establishment of the new all-island tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited, TIL. The company was formally incorporated on 11 December 2000 and its board of directors was appointed on 19 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The functions of the new company are set out in detail in its memorandum of association. In summary, the new company will have responsibility for Tourism Brand Ireland, strategic all-island destination marketing in all markets outside the island of Ireland, international roll out of regional and product marketing programmes formulated by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and operation of the overseas office network. The principles underlying the relationship between TIL, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte are set out in a memorandum of understanding agreed between the two Departments in October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> The outline programme budget of TIL has been set at IR£21 million per annum. The company's headquarters will be located in Dublin with a regional office in Coleraine. The recruitment process for the post of chief executive is at an advanced stage and the board hopes to be in a position to make an appointment very soon. In the meantime, preparatory work is progressing on the company's marketing programme for the 2002 season. The specific strategy to be employed within that programme is an operational matter for the board of TIL.</P>

      <QRef>[9929/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): The Irish Sports Council was established by commencement order under the provisions of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, (No. 6 of 1999). The statutory functions of the council include the promotion and development of sport in Ireland in accordance with Government policy.</P>
    <P>Millennium Festivals Limited, a private limited company, was set up in 1998 to develop and support festivals for the purpose of celebrating and commemorating the millennium. Following completion of its remit the company went into voluntary liquidation at the end of last year, 2000.</P>
    <P>The national assessment committee for the young people's facilities and services fund which is chaired by my Department was established in 1998 to set objectives and prepare guidelines for the assessment of plans and strategies under the fund. The aim of the fund is to support the development of youth facilities, including sports and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas, where a significant drugs problem exists or has the potential to develop. The committee monitors ongoing progress in the implementation of the plans and strategies approved for funding and addresses any difficulties or issues arising.</P>
    <P>On 10 February 1998 the Government decided that an independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming be carried out by Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. In arriving at its decision, the Government took account of all issues arising, including the concerns of victims, the desire for privacy of a number of victims and their families and the wider policy issue of how best child sex abuse cases should be handled in such circumstances in future.</P>
    <P>In 1998, I reconvened the committee which <Col N="1634" /> drew up the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland to review its contents in the light of the Murphy report. A new code was launched on 7 November 2000.</P>
    <P>In July 1998 I established a group to review the sports capital programme which is administered by my Department, with the policy objective of promoting a more strategic approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation in Ireland. The group, which was chaired by my Department and whose members were drawn from the relevant Government Departments, local authorities and the Irish Sports Council, reported to me in December 1998. In the light of recommendations of the group I introduced a new sports capital programme in 1999.</P>
    <P>I established an interdepartmental working group in August 1999 to develop guidelines and advise on the other key issues for the operation of a public-private partnership, PPP, approach in relation to swimming pools. The group is chaired by my Department and comprises of members from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Office of Public Works, and representatives from three local authorities. This report is under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>In October last, I asked the Irish Sports Council to undertake a review of Ireland's participation in the Sydney Olympics. The purpose of the review, which was carried out by a steering group appointed by the council, was to learn from the experiences of Sydney 2000 and to develop a strategy, based on the analysis of the factual information gathered during the review, for the preparations towards Athens 2004. The review was published on 6 February 2001.</P>
    <P>The national advisory committee on drugs was established by the Government in July 2000. Its role is to advise Government in relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of the drugs problem in Ireland, based on the committee's analysis and interpretation of research findings and information available to it. It is overseeing the delivery of a three year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland.</P>

      <QRef>[9959/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): As the Deputy will appreciate, responsibility for promoting the regions, including individual counties, does not rest with my <Col N="1635" /> Department but with Bord Fáilte, the relevant regional tourism authorities and the industry in each region.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the differing levels of performance throughout the country in relation to overseas tourism and have provided Bord Fáilte with funding for regional marketing to support marketing initiatives of the regional tourism authorities; with a high priority being given to the western, north western and midlands regions.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for promoting County Monaghan rests with the North West Regional Tourism Authority and I understand that the County Monaghan tourism industry plays an active role in the affairs of the authority, participating in its promotional events both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The tourism product investment scheme which will be implemented by Bord Fáilte under the national development plan will also have a strong focus on less developed tourism areas.</P>

      <Quest>if he will provide the most up to date figures on the drop-out rates among second level students; the percentage of these which come from schools that are classified as disadvantaged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9450/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI-Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment 1998 early school leavers survey indicates that about 81% of students currently complete second level education. This figure is broadly in line with my Department's analysis of data in this area which indicates a completion rate of some 83% when account is taken of a range of factors such as inter-school transfer. As much as 44% of early school leavers attended schools which are classified as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Given the vital significance of school completion for the life chances of our young people I am very conscious of continuing to press for improvements in the numbers completing second level. As the Deputy will be aware this is a complex and difficult issue and one not amenable to quick fix or easy solutions.</P>
      <P>The correct approach is to advance on a number of fronts. In the first instance we must ensure that there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act achieving this. We must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and junior certificate schools programme are examples of measures which are making a real impact.</P>
      <P>It is also essential that we assist schools in a focused manner in dealing with the problem of early school leaving. For that reason strategies are in place to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and has since been extended for a further phase up to 31 August 2002. At present I <Col N="1641" /> am considering the expansion of the initiative to additional schools and areas. This expansion will be based on need and objective criteria on the basis of the identification of the primary schools which feed the post-primary schools which have the most severe problems with retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding is allocated to targeted schools on the basis of plans which they were helped to design. This initiative was extended by a further 59 schools in June 2000. The selection of schools was based on an objective analysis of their retention rates. Accordingly schools with the most significant difficulties were invited to participate in the initiative. This has allowed resources to be targeted at schools <Col N="1642" /> through which they would reach the greatest number of young people at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the issues raised by the Alliance for Childhood concerning computer-based learning. As with all developments in our education system the well-being of the student is of primary importance to me and I share the concerns in relation to any potential negative impact due to over reliance on computers in child learning. The use of information and communications technology in education, like any other development, must be seen in the context of the potential it has for improving the learning process and for complementing rather than replacing tried and tested pedagogical practice.</P>
      <P>My Department's Schools IT2000 project, initiated in 1998, is intended to enable students to develop the skills necessary to benefit from full participation in the information society and to provide teachers with the skills to enable them to utilise ICTs as part of the learning environment of the school.</P>
      <P>A number of inter-related initiatives have been put in place to achieve these aims. These include not only a sustained process of infrastructural development for schools and a comprehensive programme of teacher ICT training but also a number of projects which concentrate on the effects and potential for the use of ICTs in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of ICT with children with learning difficulties is also being investigated and developed in this context. It is becoming clear that access <Col N="1643" /> to ICT has the potential to enhance the learning process for these children. In fact it is also evident that, in the case of certain children, access to ICT is essential to enable them to communicate and thus to make effective use of the learning process.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the processes and supports put in place by my Department within and around the Schools IT2000 programme will ensure that its aims are achieved and that the integration of ICTs into education will be done in a balanced way which will cater for and be sensitive to the needs of students.   </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last January I launched a major new programme entitled Giving Children An Even Break to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will be run over a three year period and will cost £26 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme and the school in question has been included in the rural dimension. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £750 in respect of the current school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The position of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

      <P>The special fund for students with disabilities, which is assisted by the European Social Fund, is administered directly by my Department. It provides grants towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions or post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities, including dyslexia. The purpose of the scheme is to provide the students in question with assistance and-or equipment to enable them to enter, partake in and complete their course of study.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution. Decisions on applications are taken by an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which, in 2000, consisted of representatives of my Department, a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability and a representative of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The allocations are paid to the relevant institutions in respect of particular students. The institutions disburse the funds and certify the expenditure to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Department.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated under the fund for students with disabilities has been increased substantially from £250,000 in 1998 to £1,232,889 in 2000. Under the 2000 fund allocations were made to 512 successful applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427 and 455 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. In September 2000, I established an action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students.</P>
      <P>Last September, as an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grantholders and targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: between £1,775 and £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and between £710 and £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present I am considering the report of the <Col N="1647" /> action group and I hope to be in a position to make an initial response in the near future.</P>
    <P>Late last year I also announced that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>With regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will evaluate the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and as such represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, school insurance arrangements have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, the relevant vocational education committee arranges <Col N="1648" /> insurance cover. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.</P>
    <P>The Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have already shown my commitment by establishing the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000 with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    <P>In addition, there has been significant improvement in recent years in the level of capitation grants. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly further increased by £10 to £202 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The funding assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services for the different school types at second level reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> Voluntary secondary schools with 200 pupils or more in the free education scheme receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>The Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity between the different sectors at second level.

      <P>A total of £550 million is being provided to support research, technological development and innovation in the higher education sector <Col N="1651" /> under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. As the Deputy will be aware, funding under the education RTDI is allocated on a competitive basis having regard to the quality of the proposals received and the need to promote excellence in research. Accordingly, it is not possible to forecast the amounts which will be allocated to each institution in 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department's RTDI programme comprises four sub-measures, each designed to target specific aspects of research in the third level sector. These sub-measures include grants for individual students and researchers, support for academic communications generally and funding for institutions' research needs. Awards for institutional research needs are made under the technological sector and strategic research sub-measures and involve funding for activities over several years. The timing of expenditure in a given calendar year will depend on the period of award and the rate of progress on specific projects.</P>
      <P>Bearing these caveats in mind, provisional expenditure data for 2000 in respect of research proposals from universities and institutes of technology under the RTDI are as follows:</P>

      <P>The home tuition scheme is designed to provide compensatory home based instruction to students who suffer lengthy absences from school because of serious medical conditions. The pupil to whom the Deputy refers has an excellent school attendance record and, therefore, would not be eligible for support under the home tuition scheme.</P>
      <P>Pupils who have been assessed as having special needs and are attending ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis are entitled to the support of the resource teacher service. The child in question is currently on the caseload of a resource teacher who serves three schools in the area.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently reviewing the adequacy of the resource teacher support being made available to the child in question. As soon as the inspectorate has reported my Department will be in touch with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>I have re-scheduled the leaving and junior certificate oral and practical tests, which were recently deferred, for the two week period from Monday, 23 April to Friday, 4 May 2001. A circular letter to this effect has issued to all post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The revised schedule is in the best interests of examination students as it ensures that the oral and practical tests will be completed as soon as possible after the Easter break. It also provides a reasonable gap for students before the commencement of the written examinations.</P>
      <P>While I remain very hopeful that the outcome of the ASTI ballot will be positive and that this year's examinations will proceed in all respects as usual, I have instructed my Department to keep its contingency plan, including arrangements for marking candidates' work, in place on a precautionary basis.</P>
      <P>If the examinations proceed as usual the time scale for issuing the results will remain as in previous years. I have already made it clear in the House that if it is necessary to activate the contingency plan, the results of the examinations may issue later than usual if delays are experienced during the marking process. Some delay may be unavoidable in the case of the junior certificate exam. The priority will be to ensure that standards are maintained. It is essential that the high reputation enjoyed by our public examinations continues and that public confidence in the examination system is preserved.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of 77 pupils at Killeagh national school on 30 September 1999 warrants a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2000-01 school year. Therefore, the third mainstream class teacher's post was suppressed at the end of the 1999-00 school year. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment on 30 September 2000 was 78 pupils, which is the most up to date information available to my Department on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
      <P>A circular outlining the schedule and staffing arrangements for primary schools in the 2001-02 school year will be issued in the near future to the boards of management of all primary schools.</P>

In this context the Deputy will be aware that education services are delivered throughout the country, through the schools system, the further and higher education institutions and education centres. In so far as the BMW region is concerned, the vocational education committees have a specific educational remit.</P>

      <P>As regards the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the remit, budget and responsibility of each organisation or agency involved in the BMW region, given the scale of the activities involved, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested.

      <P>Last August I announced my plans to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions. My intention is to address the related problems of non-completion of second level education and low participation rates in higher edu<Col N="1664" /> cation, which are hampering development in these regions.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement the diocesan authorities offered St. Peter's College, Wexford, as a location to facilitate development of a centre with higher education links. The development of this outreach centre is being examined in the context of my overall plans and in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to courses currently being run is that Carlow Institute of Technology runs two courses in both Wexford and Kilkenny &ndash; the national certificate in business studies and the national certificate in office information systems. Student enrolment for these courses is 32 students in Wexford and 34 in Kilkenny. These activities are funded from the institute's block grant. My Department does not specify a particular allocation to the institute for the activities.</P>
      <P>The National University of Ireland, Maynooth, also provides outreach courses in Kilkenny. Details obtained from the university in respect of the courses provided and current enrolments, are set out in the following table:</P>
