      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I read the Order of Business, on behalf of the House I congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle, on reaching the fortieth anniversary of your election to this House. You have served this House well in your constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. You fought 12 elections before your election to the twenty-eighth Dáil and you now join the handful of people who, since the foundation of the State, have given such long service. Later this morning we will have an opportunity to celebrate with you but it is appropriate that the House now congratulate you on this wonderful personal achievement.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I congratulate you also, sir. It is a great achievement to be Ceann Comhairle of this House and to be Ceann Comhairle after such a distinguished career is a magnificent achievement. Many Members of this side of the House would be interested if you would patent and circulate the formula for how to survive for 40 years and win 12 elections. We might discuss that with you later at the informal occasion after the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, to which you still belong &ndash; you are on temporary release at the moment &ndash; I can confirm to Deputy Noonan and other Deputies that rumours to the effect that you were nominated to contest elections following your confirmation, if not your first communion, while they are perfectly explicable having regard to your wonderful physical condition, are not entirely true. It is your steadfast loyalty to the ideals of labour and, more importantly, your incredible service to the constituents of Carlow-Kilkenny which have kept you here in this House. We are delighted, on your behalf, to celebrate your honour today.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 30, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 4) Regulations, 2001; No. 31, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Eligible Customer) Order, 2001; No. 32, motion re Membership of Committees and No.1, Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 30, 31 and 32 shall be decided without debate and that questions shall be taken from 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. In the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the Order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past four years the Taoiseach and his Ministers have been telling the Irish public that they have a plan of campaign which would lead to the closure of the plant at Sellafield. Instead of succeeding in their campaign to close Sellafield, a major expansion has been announced by the British Government with its approval of the new MOX plant at Sellafield. This poses additional environmental and health risks to the people of Ireland. Sellafield is very near the east coast of Ireland and there have been serious doubts about the effects of the plant on the health of the Irish nation previously. Does the Taoiseach accept that his four year campaign to close Sellafield has been an abject failure? Given his commitment to raise the Sellafield issue with the British Prime Minister at every available opportunity, does the Taoiseach admit that he has been singularly ineffective in influencing him, despite the apparent good relationship they enjoy? Has the Taoiseach raised the issue of the approval of the MOX plant at Sellafield with Mr. Blair on a number of occasions? Does the Taoiseach plan, at the first available opportunity, to request the Prime Minister not to go ahead with the planned MOX plant? Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House if he believes he has any influence with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair where Irish interests are concerned, other than in matters relating to Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to Deputy Noonan's</P>
      <P>queries, may I add some additional questions? Can the Taoiseach confirm that, upon entry into office four and a half years ago, there existed an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government? The committee followed on from the excellent success achieved by Deputy Stagg in ensuring that permission for an underground storage plant was refused. Can the Taoiseach confirm that the committee was disbanded or downgraded when he became Taoiseach, to the extent that a Minister of State was responsible for its operation rather than a Minister? Can the Taoiseach confirm that an interdepartmental committee which met on a frequent basis and which had access to technical, scientific and legal advice, was effectively mothballed and has met infrequently, if at all? In the light of this major threat to the environmental safety of the people of this island, does the Taoiseach propose to reinstate the status of the committee and give it the priority it enjoyed under the previous Administration?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputies Noonan and Quinn, I confirm that the Government, as it has during the past four years and as have other Governments, including those of which I have been a member, will continue to do everything it can on every front, legally and politically, to stop the British Government from pursuing its proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement yesterday that the MOX plant is to be commissioned is difficult to comprehend for a number of reasons. A new look at safety and exposure to risk was expected in the light of recent tragic events. I thought the British Government would look at such issues, considering it is actively involved in the aftermath of 11 September. The proposed plant has been the subject of frequent strong exchanges between the two Governments over the past four years and long before that. It is the subject of arbitration proceedings initiated by Ireland against the United Kingdom under the OSPAR Convention. A high level meeting between Irish and British officials is due to take place tomorrow. We asked that no decision be taken on the matter while arbitration is in progress and we expected that request to be honoured, something we will pursue tomorrow. The United Kingdom's view that the manufacture of MOX fuel is justified does not accord with the Irish view, that the economic case has not been made in accordance with the requirements of EU law.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom view is that the manufacture of MOX fuel is justified, but our view is that the economic case has not been made in accordance with the requirements of EU law. The OSPAR Convention and the OSPAR case are important because when the United Kingdom put in its planning application, for commercial reasons as it stated, no attempt was made to include figures or to make an economic case. A series of Xs was included right through the economic assessment, which was entirely inappropriate. One cannot attempt to make a case while ignoring the economic position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Noonan's question, I assure him that our advice has always been that there are three ways in which we can fight this: under the OSPAR Convention, under EU law or under UN law. The OSPAR Convention arbitration process was the first step. While success would not close the plant, it would give us the economic assessment and information which we did not have. We are advised that we have a sustainable case under EU law, specifically Directives 142 and 227 of the EURATOM Treaty. We can fight the decision on the basis of directives and procedures which we think the United Kingdom has infringed. I assure the House that the Government believes the development of the MOX plant to be totally unsatisfactory. I have <Col N="716" /> raised the matter with Mr. Blair on several occasions and I will do so again.</P>

      <P>I presume the Taoiseach is aware that the British Prime Minister, while addressing the House of Commons this morning, stated that there is incontrovertible evidence that the attacks on the United States were organised by Mr. bin Laden's group. Mr. Blair's declaration of this fact is, in all probability, the first step in declaring war against Afghanistan and possibly other countries within the next few days. In view of the ease with which a ship on the high seas carrying plutonium rods may be deemed a terrorist target, will the Taoiseach, as an interim measure, request the British Government today to defer its plans to construct the MOX plant at Sellafield until a peaceful world order has been established, whenever that may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's request will be met at the meeting tomorrow. I hope to speak to Mr. Blair today. I will certainly speak to him within the next 24 hours. I take the point made by Deputy Noonan, but it is not the only point. Effectively, what will happen is that France, Germany and a number of other countries that have decided not to engage in the recycling of spent nuclear fuel will bring the fuel up the Irish Sea to be recycled at the MOX plant and then parade back down the Irish Sea again. It is an entirely unreasonable position on the part of the British, but they have not listened to our case for nine or ten years. The EURATOM Treaty allows Ireland to make a case concerning the justification of the plant, with specific reference to withholding of information on the cost of the plant, the fact that its capital cost was excluded from the economic case and the violation of the obligation to subject the plant to a proper environmental assessment. We can fight the decision on these grounds which, admittedly, are perhaps the grounds under which we have to fight it. The Government believes it has a sustainable case under EU law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case we are taking under the OSPAR Convention is important so that we can access information. Our sustainable case, we hope, is under Directives 142 and 227 of the EURATOM <Col N="717" /> Treaty. We will proceed with that and the point made by Deputy Noonan.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the legality and constitutional appropriateness of pursuing the 25th amendment to the Constitution. I made it plain, based on very good legal advice I had received and which in the past has proven to be well informed, that Article 46.4 was not being properly utilised. Subsequent to that the Taoiseach's senior spokespersons rejected my assertion and in an informal media briefing yesterday evening gave a draft or a copy or a note of what purported to be an extract from legal advice. When queried by some of the senior journalists they stated that there was no written advice given by the Attorney General to the Government in relation to the constitutionality of this provision and that oral advice had been given by the Attorney General to the Cabinet in consideration of the proposal. I find that extraordinary for a matter of such complexity; the Minister for Foreign Affairs is right.</P>

      <P>I was of the view yesterday that there was merit in the case being made by Deputy Quinn and I have had no advice today that would make me take up a different position. On an associated issue, the conduct of the referendum, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has decided that the Referendum Commission will not be funded in the manner in which it was funded in advance of the Nice Treaty? What arrangements will be put in place through the Commission to fund both sides and contrary arguments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for giving me the chance to give the advice that the Attorney General has given.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked yesterday about the 25th Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. I answered the Deputy correctly yesterday but I did not have a chance to talk about it later. I can clear the issue up to the Deputy's satisfaction as his legal advice is based on a radical misunderstanding of Article 46.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one proposal in the Bill to amend the Constitution, namely, to insert into the Constitution the text set out in the First Schedule and the text of a criminal statute, as set out in the Second Schedule, is not a proposal within the meaning of Article 46.4 of the Constitution. The <Col N="718" /> Bill to amend the Constitution does not propose that the Schedule to legislation should become or have any legal effect. A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Bill to amend the Constitution will only give effect to the amendment set out in the First Schedule and will not give effect to anything in the Second Schedule. A separate, subsequent decision by the Oireachtas to enact the Bill in the terms of the Second Schedule is the only way in which the terms can become law or have any effect. If the referendum is carried, the changes that it effects in the Constitution will lapse if the Legislature fails to enact the terms of the Constitution. As I said at the press conference the other day, the amendment to the Constitution to accommodate the Good Friday Agreement and to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution came into effect only when the State became bound by the terms of the Agreement. The vote was on 22 May 1998 and it was Christmas 1998 before it took effect. The terms of that agreement, many of which had nothing to do with the Constitution at all, were not proposals to amend the Constitution within the meaning of Article 46.</P>
    <P>The point Deputy Quinn made yesterday was that it is precisely because it is unlawful to propose a criminal law and a constitutional law in the same Bill that the present amendment was drafted as it is. It was drafted deliberately to avoid containing two proposals, which was the Deputy's concern, and it does not contain two proposals. The legislation, the text of which is set out in the Second Schedule, is not being processed for enactment; all that people are voting for is to accommodate that legislation in the Constitution should the Oireachtas, at a later stage, pass it into law. I assure Deputy Quinn that based on my legal advice, which was checked long before this and the Good Friday Agreement also, what he said yesterday was based on an erroneous assumption &ndash; that matters set out in the Schedule of the Bill to amend the Constitution amount to legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>To be helpful, I wrote to Opposition Leaders about points for clarification in a non-confrontational way, as this debate has in the past been emotive and if anyone seeks information I am happy to reply on any point and to give briefings. My purpose is to ensure we all know what we are doing; if there are some other purposes that is fine also but I would rather there were not, on this issue. I am not making that point about Deputy Quinn's contribution, but about other issues.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Noonan's question, no decision has been made on funding or how the Referendum Commission will work but as soon as it is I will let him know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reply but I disagree fundamentally with his analysis. He has not answered my first question, which related to whether the advice given was oral advice. His spokesperson said yesterday that the advice was oral. In light of the seriousness of this matter, the <Col N="719" /> fact that it will be subject to litigation &ndash; we have had the X and C cases &ndash; and in the interests of clarity I have two questions, so that if the Irish people are asked to vote on an amendment to the Constitution, the provisions of that amendment are legally sound. Despite varying views we are all agreed that the amendment must be appropriate. Does the Taoiseach have written advice from the Attorney General? Will he publish that advice in a manner similar to the way Attorney General Peter Sutherland published his advice in 1983 and Attorney General Dermot Gleeson published his advice in 1995? Those are two direct questions.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business and arising from what the Taoiseach has just said, he has indicated new information to the House, that the Second Schedule to the Bill as published is for information purposes only. Does that mean that the Second Schedule will not be subject to the normal scrutiny of Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage in the House? If it is not subject to the normal scrutiny of the House and is not, in effect, part of the legislation but merely there for information purposes, is it not true that then it is not subject to amendment at all? Once a referendum is passed, the subsequent legislation introduced may not be amended. Is the Taoiseach saying to us that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, as outlined for information purposes in the Second Schedule of the Referendum Bill, may not be amended at all by the Government or anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not saying that. The Bill would be debated as part of the overall discussion. It will be debated right through the Stages but the Presidential signature would be withheld. After the vote it would have to come back to the House and as I understand it, amendment made in the course of that debate could be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two contradictory pieces of advice now from the Taoiseach. He has indicated in reply to Deputy Quinn that there is only one Bill and that the Second Schedule to that Bill is there for information purposes and information purposes only. If there is only one Bill, how can a full parliamentary debate take place, including <Col N="720" /> Committee and Report Stages, with the possibility of amendments being made on the proposal of the Government or Opposition? How can this be?</P>
      <P>I do not understand the second part of the Taoiseach's advice to the effect that amendments made in the House, but not in effect signed off by the President, can subsequently be introduced in the event of a referendum being successful and can be included in subsequent legislation. This is a legal quagmire; the Taoiseach is very unclear about what is happening and has a responsibility to put the written advice of the Attorney General before the House in order that we are not put in the position of buying a pig in a poke on behalf of the Irish people.</P>

As we see it, this is inextricably linked through Article 46.4 to the amendment process and is, therefore, flawed. The Taoiseach, however, rejects that opinion and has promised to provide us with the legal advice he has received on the matter. Will the promised legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy come through the House in the normal way? Will we have a Second Stage debate? Will it be possible to amend the Bill in any way as it passes through the House?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement yesterday, and it is welcome, that Ireland will proceed to the ratification of seven of the 12 international conventions on terrorism which we had not yet ratified. On the legislative programme, if these seven are to be ratified, that will require work by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department. If, at the same time, there is a commitment being given at the Council meeting &ndash; to the proceedings of which we do not have access &ndash; on reforms in security at the level of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, how is it proposed to harmonise these two legislative programmes and have they implications for the European Convention on Human Rights? Will the Taoiseach set out a timetable, so that we can see which legislation is likely to come first and the relationship of one batch of legislation to the other. Otherwise, all three commitments will be quite meaningless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point and we can set that out. The Justice and Home Affairs Council, which met about a fortnight ago, agreed to assess, in all of the countries, what conventions remain to be ratified. In our case, we have ratified 13 of them, ranging from the Tokyo agreement of 1963 right up to the New York one at the end of 1999. There are also six other conventions which we have not ratified. Some of those date back to the early 1970s. Then, there are some new proposals which were also discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting. There has also been a suggestion from India for a composite motion at the UN to try to achieve some agreement on many of the outstanding ones, because if we have to wait for the legislative base to go through all Parliaments, that would take a long time. That would not be helpful in the aftermath of the events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>We are looking at the six or seven most important conventions, including conventions on prevention and punishment of crime and the taking of hostages, to see how we can best deal with those. If we were to get involved in drafting each one individually, I am concerned that that could take a few years. We have to see if there is any other way of dealing with these issues. Other countries are taking the same approach. Legislation will be required and that can lead to constitutional problems &ndash; for instance, the difficulties we had in relation to extradition over the past 20 years. The examination is proceeding and, as the Deputy has requested, I will ask the Minister to set out clearly what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's answer is <Col N="725" /> helpful. If the conclusions of the European Council meeting were entirely within the framework of the international conventions &ndash; the UN conventions &ndash; it would be possible to envisage what the legislation would be like, but the problem is in relation to the balance. When the Taoiseach says there are other matters which have been agreed by the Ministers, one is left with the problem of whether the legislative programme deals with the international conventions not ratified or, if it deals with such additional items, are these consistent with that legislation and with the ECHR. That is the problem on which we need parliamentary scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. Of the list of about 20 conventions, we have ratified 13 over the years, leaving at least six which we have not ratified. Then there are the new proposals which were brought forward, to which the Deputy has referred. There are still some outstanding issues from Canberra, back in 1999.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we have ratified many of those, such as Tokyo, The Hague and Montreal. There are at least 13 which we have ratified. That list went back over everything since 1973 and each country was asked what it had done. That is also being done at UN level, right across the world. Deputy Michael D. Higgins made a valid point about the amount of work involved in the legislative programme. It is not just a matter of declaring that all of those conventions are law. In our case, they could infringe on various constitutional issues. We have not really got very much work done on this. That is the Deputy's point and I agree with him. Between now and 7 December, when we report back to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, we have to come to a conclusion on that. We also have to review why some of these resolutions were not ratified at the time. Some of them go back 30 years and I do not know the answer to that question. We now have to look at all of those issues. I will ask the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give priority to this &ndash; most of the conventions are in that Department's area &ndash; and to give the Deputy a report on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Richard Bruton, Owen and Deenihan. I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann conscious of the vital importance of the airline industry and of Aer Lingus in particular to the commercial life of the nation and deeply concerned about the future of the industry and noting the decision of the US Federal Government to support US airlines, calls on the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance to move motions at meetings of EU Ministers to enable EU national governments to give financial assistance to their airline industries in order to assist <Col N="727" /> them survive the current temporary downturn in aviation business and further calls for the deferment of any decision on the future ownership of the national airline for at least three years to enable the airline to be strengthened and restructured.</P>
    <P>I have already given notice, and I do so again now, that one of the major themes on which Fine Gael will fight the next general election is the failure by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to manage the most successful years the Irish economy has ever had.</P>
    <P>Everywhere we look, we see this failure of management. We see it in the health service, in the education sector, in the gridlock on our roads countrywide, in the failure of the Government to organise driving tests in an efficient and effective manner, in the appalling failure to manage asylum seekers, in the mess that is Dublin Airport, in the rip-off of almost half a million people in the Eircom flotation, in the failure to deliver affordable housing, in the failure to deal with homelessness, in the failure to bring about much needed infrastructural change in the telecommunications sector and so on.</P>
    <P>The litany of Government failure would be inexcusable in any circumstances but it is particularly so in circumstances where we have had the most successful economic growth in the western world. Our rate of economic achievement was envied all over the world. The performance of the economy was first rate. The performance of the Government in managing it can only be described as dismal.</P>
    <P>While the Government produced discussion paper after consultative paper, created photo opportunity after photo opportunity, it avoided most issues where decisiveness and leadership were required. Meanwhile, the ordinary people got on with the job and developed some of the most successful enterprises this country has ever known.</P>
    <P>This was done despite the failure of Government. We need look no further than the high-tech sector where an OECD survey shows that this country is now the ninth most expensive for peak time Internet access and where broadband penetration is just 0.01% of the total population. That Irish software companies have succeeded at all is remarkable given that they typically pay ten times more than their British counterparts for the relevant services and for that money, they get the service at one-tenth of the speed.</P>
    <P>There is a thread common to many of the difficulties I have highlighted &ndash; in transport, in telecommunications, in airports and in aviation. That thread is the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. Her failure and that of the Government is most obvious, most alarming and most regrettable in the case of Aer Lingus. She has been the shareholder representative of that company for more than four years and has managed in that short space of time to bring a once proud national symbol to its very knees. She has <Col N="728" /> done so at a time when Ryanair has gone from strength to strength. She cannot blame market conditions. She cannot blame the ups and downs of the Irish economy because it was all up. She cannot blame the decline in the Irish economy because, as I said, it was all up. She cannot blame a decline in the Irish or in the world business sector because that was all up also. She cannot blame passenger numbers because they were all up. She cannot blame anybody but herself, although I would suggest that the Taoiseach's failure of leadership has also been a decisive factor in the near collapse of Aer Lingus. He should have recognised a long time ago that his Minister was quite simply not up to the job. He should have overcome his normal desire to be seen as the nice guy and removed her from office.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect briefly on the situation which the Minister inherited. In the two and a half years of the rainbow Coalition, passenger numbers in and out of Ireland were never higher, Aer Lingus was massively profitable and the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, mandated the board of Aer Lingus to explore the possibilities of the airline entering a strategic alliance with or without the transfer of equity and to submit proposals to the Minister as shareholders. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, came into office in June 1997. What did she do? As with so many other things, she dithered, ducked and weaved. It was December 1999 before she announced the intention to sell the entire 95% Government shareholding &ndash; a move which was estimated at the time to raise up to £600 million for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The market place looked good, aviation stocks were doing well but because of the public's experience with the Eircom flotation, they were deeply suspicious of anything which the Minister was offering. She did not help her own case when she emphasised that the flotation would &ldquo;follow the Eircom model&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made it clear that she wished to complete the sale before the end of the year 2000. The Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, was to provide the legislative framework for the IPO. The Minister appointed the necessary advisers and committed to the usual high fees as she had done in the case of Eircom. Meanwhile, encouraged by the Minister, Aer Lingus planned its strategy on the basis of the availability of private sector capital. At no stage did the Minister do anything to disabuse Aer Lingus of the correctness of its approach in allowing for the provision of private sector capital.</P>
    <P>Somehow or other, from the summer of 2000 onwards, the Minister lost control of this situation. She had lost control well before the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the softening of economic conditions in the US market. She was certainly floundering at the end of last year when she began to talk about looking for an alternative sale option for the airline. She asked advisers to take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and she created such an <Col N="729" /> atmosphere of uncertainty and indecisiveness that no one in the aviation sector could any longer regard her as a serious player. One day it was a public offering of Aer Lingus stock, the next day it was a sale to anyone who might buy it. In the circumstances, it was hardly surprising that the airline went from crisis to crisis and that it has now reached the lowest point in a very distinguished history.</P>
    <P>At this late stage, what is needed above all else is clarity. Without clarity, there can be no industry or consumer confidence in Aer Lingus. Without confidence, the decline in forward bookings will not be arrested. Unless this decline is arrested, Aer Lingus will go the way of Swissair and Sabena.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, vital that the Minister answer straight questions with straight answers. First, what are her objectives in relation to Aer Lingus and how does she propose to achieve them? Second, is it the Government's intention to further back the airline financially and if so, on what conditions will it do so? Third, is there a reasonable expectation that EU permission can be secured for any further state assistance which the Government might have in mind? Fourth, if it is the Government's intention not to give additional financial support to the airline, either because it believes this is inappropriate or because of EU prohibitions, how does the Government intend that Aer Lingus will be led out of its current difficulties?</P>
    <P>The employees of Aer Lingus, the tourism interests, particularly away from the east coast and the people need answers to these questions and they need the answers now. Last year, 1.2 million tourists came here from North America. With the reduced capacity now announced, we will be lucky to have a million this year and it looks particularly black for next year when forward bookings would indicate an almost wipe-out of the North American market. Without a national carrier, particularly serving the North Atlantic, we have no possibility of maintaining and developing a vibrant tourism industry, particularly away from the east coast. Shannon without Aer Lingus is simply not viable. Not only is it the key transatlantic airport for tourism from Kerry to Donegal but it is a key cargo airport for the industries radiating out from Shannon which are so dependent on the North American markets.</P>
    <P>I will address a question to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid. As part of the Good Friday Agreement arrangements, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board amalgamated key promotional functions into Tourism Ireland, a company which has a board, a chief executive and a budget but no employees to administer it. Just when tourism needs the maximum support, the Minister has managed to preside over the creation of another fiasco, another fine mess &ndash; an agency without employees to either spend its budget or implement its policies. The situation is critical and requires immediate action. It is for this reason <Col N="730" /> that I must press the Minister for immediate answers. What are her plans for Aer Lingus? How does she propose to implement them and what is the timetable?</P>
    <P>I have a proposal to make which I hope the Minister will find helpful. It relates to the possibility of State support for Aer Lingus, particularly against the background of the support the US Administration has made available to US airline companies. At present, there are three airlines connecting the United States and Ireland. These are Continental, Delta and Aer Lingus. Continental and Delta are beneficiaries of US Government support. It seems quite extraordinary that a Commission in Brussels would, in those circumstances, refuse to allow the Irish Government to give some support to Aer Lingus. In particular, given our island status and the fact that we are so heavily dependent on the US for investment, trade and tourism, it seems entirely unreasonable that the Commission would continue to refuse the provision of support in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>I can understand that the Commission's refusal to allow Aer Lingus as a whole to be subsidised may be a tenable position. My proposal, therefore, is that the Government should revert to a position which previously existed and split Aer Lingus into two airlines, one serving the United States and the other serving European cities. The application to the Commission in Brussels for approval to give subsidies might be confined to the transatlantic alliance and the case might be based exclusively on the precedent created by the US Administration. Brussels can hardly object to the creation of a level playing field. If the case was properly presented, I believe Ireland's special status as an island and its special economic links and dependency on the United States might sway Brussels and allow at least some short-term support for Aer Lingus if the company was restructured on the basis outlined.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that Aer Lingus is in a dire situation. The company had been losing money for a long period before the events of 11 September. Since that date, traffic on the north Atlantic route &ndash; in both directions &ndash; has fallen by 30%, October to December bookings are down by more than 30% and the downturn will cost £40 million, leading probably to a loss this year for Aer Lingus of £70 million compared to a loss of £58 last year. It is estimated that 600 temporary staff and 25% of permanent staff will be laid off and that the resulting redundancy package will cost approximately £150 million. In addition, it will cost a further £50 million to restructure the company. Without fudging the issue in any way and without taking any half measures, it is, therefore, apparent that £200 million will be the minimum amount of money needed to ensure that Aer Lingus does not go the way of Sabena and Swissair. It is for the Minister to decide whether that £200 million is provided by way of borrowings or equity. Part of the total may be provided through borrowings, but some of it must be provided through equity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> I reiterate that if there is a principled objection in Brussels, the Minister should restructure the airline by dividing it into a north Atlantic airline and a European airline. A total of 40% of Aer Lingus' business and 60% of its profits come from the North American routes and it will not be viable unless those routes are viable.</P>
    <P>The latest announcements indicate that 68 flights due to leave Shannon each week are being cancelled. Most of our linkages from the mid-west to Dublin Airport have been cancelled out. Not only is this affecting the tourism industry, it is completely detaching the mid-west and the west from the economy of the remainder of the country. This will shatter the economies of these two areas and I would like the Minister to comment on these adverse effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin where Deputy Noonan left off. The crisis with which Aer Lingus is faced cannot be traded out of in normal commercial terms. The Minister was slow to accept that point of view but she has slowly come around to it. Everyone has seen the shock waves going through the industry with 100,000 jobs lost in the US and 25,000 lost in Europe. Passenger numbers are collapsing and normal, orderly restructuring is not possible against such a background. The Minister must recognise that the impetus towards restructuring is being swamped by the need for survival. The normal avenues companies would consider in such situations are no longer viable. For example, it is estimated that it will cost £50 million for a redundancy package at Aer Lingus. We know the airline's money is running out, that it will be gone by February and that it cannot afford to pay for such a package. If redundancies form part of the package to save Aer Lingus, the Minister will have to find a way to provide the company with the funding it requires.</P>
      <P>The payback times for other options such as contracting out are not quick enough and would not alleviate the sort of cash crisis the company is facing. It is the responsibility of the Government to define the strategic priorities and set about achieving them with a purpose. I do not see that sense of purpose or clarity emerging from the Minister or her advisers. Ireland is a small island economy and it has placed all its eggs in the basket containing foreign trade, foreign investment and foreign tourism. Almost 150% of our GNP comes from external trade of one form or another. We cannot get away from the fact that we depend on access transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the last occasion on which the Minister will address the Dáil before travelling to Brussels and she must articulate what is the strategic role which is, in essence, built around Aer Lingus and which must be protected. She must also indicate the sort of restructuring she envisages will be consistent with that objective. The latter has not been forthcoming from the Department. The Minister must also make a clear statement on the nature <Col N="732" /> and extent of the State aid necessary to secure that combination.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to provide clarity on this issue. The Minister was ambivalent at the outset with regard to whether the company could trade its way out of this crisis and it took a long period before it was realised that State aid was required. We heard from her unnamed spokesman that she attended a meeting with the chairman of the Transport Council and that the issue of State aid was not discussed. Perhaps that was a false report, but it is incredible that the issue of State aid would not be discussed at such a meeting. There have been continuing mixed signals about the issue of ownership and the position must be clarified.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by the amendment to the motion tabled by the Minister. For example, it states that the Minister will examine all available options. That is like looking at the problem through a pair of binoculars. Aer Lingus is faced with a crisis because its cash is running out. The amendment also states that the Minister is seeking details of the US subvention. There is no urgency in that statement. The details are available because the package has already been approved by Congress. There is no need to look for the details; they are available on the Internet. The Minister has raised the red herring of no return to State aid for non-viable airlines. That is not the issue and no one is seeking a return to a situation where the State props up companies. It must be recognised that this crisis is not of Aer Lingus' creation.</P>
    <P>The amendment also states that &ldquo;Aer Lingus has taken the first vital steps&rdquo;, but it is clearly implied that the Minister envisages the company must do many other things. She has, however, failed to articulate these and we need to know what they are. The need for the Minister to articulate her view on the issue of State aid is crucial because we have an opportunity to shape the direction the EU Commission and EU Ministers take rather than just sitting back and reacting while other bigger players jockey for position to protect their strategic interests. One can be sure that this is what they are doing at present. The idea of not discussing key issues is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>It is clear that EU state aid rules permit aid. They permit aid to undo damage caused by exceptional circumstances &ndash; which is clearly the position in this case &ndash; and to restructure an airline in a way that is once-off and removes capacity in order not to be unfair to competitors &ndash; that is clearly an issue here. The rules also allow emergency rescue aid. It is clear that there are avenues under EU state aid rules which we can pursue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan has already referred to the USA which has given $5 billion in state subsidies in the form of direct cash on the basis of flight miles and provided $10 billion in loan guarantees. In addition, there is a Bill before Congress for $4 billion in assistance to displaced workers and the <Col N="733" /> American authorities are envisaging shouldering the extra costs incurred on foot of the new security requirements involving the screening of luggage. Ireland has a strategic interest equal to that of the US which it must protect. We need that interest to be articulated here today. The prosperity of thousands of families living in the north side of Dublin who helped to create the economic miracle built on access to the country depends on the decisions that will be taken. There must be a much clearer statement of strategy. The Opposition will not be found wanting if the Minister articulates a clear, concise strategy. We will be behind it. However, that has not happened. There has been evasion and a lack of clarity which is damaging to the future of 7,000 workers and the tourism and commercial interests associated with them.</P>

      <P>On Monday, Aer Lingus staff were told drinking water would no longer be provided in their offices. Within the past 48 hours Delta Airlines has withdrawn its services from Ireland to New York. What a tragic state of affairs has been allowed to develop under the stewardship of the Minister and the Government. I do not deny the events of 11 September have had a disastrous effect on the aviation industry world wide but little more than a year ago the Minister stated in a major contribution in the House on another motion: &ldquo;I am confident that the company will long continue to provide this service for its customers&rdquo;. Unless the Minister and the Government take action and adopt progressive steps they will preside over the demise of this great airline.</P>
      <P>When Seán Lemass witnessed the departure of the first Aer Lingus aeroplane, An tIolar or the Eagle, from Baldonnel to Bristol he inaugurated not only a national airline but a symbol of the very essence of our Irishness. Our republic was only 14 years old in 1936 and Aer Lingus grew and developed side by side with the new republic. The staff of 12, including one pilot, on the first flight could not have foreseen how important the company would become in terms of opening up Ireland to visitors, allowing people to travel abroad for both business and pleasure and facilitating emigration in the dark years and immigration over the past ten years. The company was the greatest creator of jobs in the 1980s, greater even than the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second World War a confined service continued and preparations were made to capitalise on the boom in commercial aviation at the end of the war, yet now the Minister and the Government are doing nothing to save the company. Aer Lingus has acted as the true marketeer of Ireland and many tourists would not have visited the country but for the branding and sales effort of the company. Aer Lingus hostesses and pilots were our ambassadors for many years at the St. Patrick's Day festival in New York. They were instantly recognised as Irish but 65 years later there is little or no will on the part of the Government or the Minister to fight like hell to <Col N="734" /> ensure the future of our national airline. Staff morale is at rock bottom because they do not feel any sense of urgency on the part of the chief shareholder of the company about the need for action.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the events of 11 September had a disastrous effect but Aer Lingus had a future before that date and the Government should not stand by helplessly and allow the company to die. The more than 6,000 staff at the company displayed true patriotism during the implementation of the Cahill plan. They accepted cuts, job losses, the setting aside of wage increases and changes in working conditions so that their company would survive and recover from the economic downturn in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The reason morale is so low is that when the company achieved profitability there was no recognition of these sacrifices and staff were forced to highlight their meagre wages by going on strike in 2000 and 2001, which was the first strike since 1978 when, interestingly, Fianna Fáil was also in Government. The staff are not blind to the serious crisis facing the business but they are deeply discouraged from taking the inevitable actions required to consolidate the company because of the weakness of the Government and the disinterest being displayed by it.</P>
    <P>One only has to examine the evidence of lethargy. Why is there no chief executive? What is the Government doing about it? As Deputy Bruton said, no case has seriously been made in Brussels despite the existence of Article 87.2.B which allows for assistance in times of national emergency or exceptional circumstances. These are exceptional circumstances and the moneys provided by the US Government to assist its airlines reflect this and a similar case could be made in Brussels. The legislation dealing with Aer Lingus should not have been withdrawn from the legislative programme for this session as that has led to confusion. How can the Minister table an amendment to our motion stating the legislation is off the agenda? She should at least announce later that the legislation will be processed.</P>
    <P>A number of contradictory statements have been made by different Ministers. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid's attitude is &ldquo;Never fear, McDaid is here. Everything will be grand&rdquo;, while the Tánaiste's attitude is &ldquo;No money will be invested, get lost&rdquo;. The Minister for Public Enterprise said &ldquo;Do not ask me. I am still annoyed about Mick O'Leary's advertisements and nobody helped me when he was writing those advertisements&rdquo;, while the Taoiseach is saying he has to open a poodle parlour or a barbers shop somewhere. No Minister has taken charge of this crisis and that has caused confusion. They are all making different statements. One minute the Government cannot make a case to Brussels and the next it hopes to do so. One minute Deputy McDaid is saying everything will be all right and the next another Minister is contradicting him.</P>
    <P>Where is the plan needed to pull Aer Lingus <Col N="735" /> through this crisis? How many routes and staff will be axed? Will the trans-Atlantic service continue? Delta Airlines has withdrawn its services to New York and concerns exist about Continental Airlines, despite the money being provided to the company by the US Government? Will the staff be paid their PPF wage increase which was negotiated for all workers? <i>The Irish Times</i> has reported the increase will not be paid. If they do not receive the increase will they be given an assurance that when conditions improve they will be paid?</P>
    <P>Will airline insurance continue to be provided? This issue was raised in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday, 28 September. Nobody could get an answer as to which Department was responsible for insurance. The article stated:</P>
    <P>With just hours to go before the planes were being grounded we were being passed &ldquo;from Billy to Jack&rdquo; for information. The Department of Public Enterprise suggested the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and even the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance said responsibility lay with the Department of Public Enterprise &ndash; maybe because Aer Lingus was involved, even though five other airlines were affected. The Taoiseach's Department said the issue was still being discussed while all other Departments suggested the issue had to be decided at European level.</P>
    <P>If that is a sign of what is going on, I am not surprised there is confusion. Which Department will be responsible for dealing with insurance? What will happen to the 1,700 who have already been flagged to lose their jobs? Many of them live in the suburbs of north Dublin, which are already faced with the loss of 2,000 jobs at Gateway and Motorola.</P>
    <P>Can an adequate service be provided if no money is available for overtime? What will happen to the pension scheme? The Minister met a group of Fianna Fáil Members to announce with great fanfare that everything would be all right with regard to the pension scheme yet nothing has happened for retired employees. There have been no changes to the current pension scheme for employees because they are linked to the legislation which will now not be taken. These are some of the questions I am being asked by the staff of Aer Lingus and people who live near me whose family members work for the company. They are frightened by the lack of action and answers.</P>
    <P>Seán Lemass would not be proud of the lethargy being shown by the Minister and his party. The decisions necessary to safeguard our national airline are not being tackled. Aer Lingus services 30 destinations with 38 aircraft and carried more than 7 million passengers in 2000. I referred to the first aeroplane, the Eagle, earlier. We demand that the eagle does not land, which is what the Government wants to happen. We want it to be <Col N="736" /> available to fly for future generations under a more competent Government.</P>
    <P>I refer to a statement by former Aer Lingus chief executive, Michael Dargan, in 1979. He stated: &ldquo;We have honoured the trust of our small country by demonstrating we could match the world in one of its most sophisticated industries and, thus, we have contributed to the confidence of our young generation in Ireland&rdquo;. If 6,000 jobs were under threat in Athlone or somewhere else in the Minister's constituency, she would be doing a hell of a lot more to make sure something was done to secure as many of those jobs as possible. The Minister must act now. She should tell us what she can do in Brussels, what answers she has received and what the Government plans to do to save this airline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the future of Shannon Airport and I am sure my colleague from the region, Deputy Daly, will support me. Shannon Airport is recognised as the most powerful instrument in terms of the economic prosperity of the mid-west region and the entire western seaboard. Any downgrading of the airport will have a devastating consequence for the region.</P>
      <P>When the status of Shannon Airport was changed some years ago, people in Kerry did not realise the consequences the decision would have for the region and they have suffered the effects of that decision ever since. If there is a further downgrading of the services to Shannon Airport, it will have a major adverse effect on the tourism industry in Kerry and the region. It will also have a major effect on the economic vibrancy of the region. Aer Lingus has announced that it intends to discontinue 68 flights from Shannon. This will make the airport redundant. Flights to Baltimore/Washington and Newark will be discontinued but more alarmingly for business people who commute between the greater Shannon region and Dublin and onto Europe, certain flights will be totally abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early morning flights from Shannon will be discontinued. The flights from Shannon to Dublin will be, in the main, pick-up services on the transatlantic routes. There will be a reduction in dedicated scheduled flights solely covering Shannon to Dublin. If a businessman goes to Dublin in the morning, there will be no flight if he wishes to return in the afternoon. In addition, the popular Shannon to Paris service will be discontinued. This was Aer Lingus's only flight that linked Shannon Airport directly to Europe. Its discontinuation will have a major effect on the significant number of French and other nationals who work in companies in Shannon and the region. They found the route useful because it meant they could commute by rapid rail services to Holland, Belgium and other countries over a weekend. The absence of the service will have a major effect on engineers and others with a high level of expertise who work in the electronics industry and live in the Shannon region. The service <Col N="737" /> between Dublin and Belfast has been discontinued. This connection was very popular and it improved contact between North and South and the business regions of Shannon and Belfast. The discontinuation of the service will have a knock-on effect.</P>
    <P>I understand that next summer only three direct flights will operate from Shannon to the USA. It has been reliably claimed &ndash; perhaps the Minister could clarify the position &ndash; that Shannon Airport will lose about 700,000 passengers next year. This means that one quarter of the business of the airport will be taken away. At present, 850 people work in Aer Lingus in Shannon and I understand that one quarter of them will lose their jobs immediately. The area has a vibrant economy but it has experienced job losses recently and it cannot sustain that level of job losses for long. The jobs involved are good and have existed for some time. People have worked hard but they are facing the prospect of losing their jobs. The loss of 700,000 passengers will have a major effect on the hotel, bed and breakfast and guesthouse industry in addition to the general business community.</P>
    <P>The US Government has in various ways given approximately £15 billion in aid to the airline business in America. This will make it more competitive and sustainable. I listened to the debate about the problem the European Commission has with the funding of state airlines. However, in this instance, the Government is the 95% shareholder in the company; the employees have 5%. It is an anti-competitive measure that Aer Lingus cannot ask its main shareholder for funding. If a company is in trouble, it can go back to its shareholders and seek further funding. The current position is a reverse anti-competitive measure against a State company. The decision by the American Government to support its airline industry means a good case can be made to the European Union to allow the Government to support our airline from State funds and ensure its survival. Swissair and Sabena are currently in serious difficulty and British Airways is also in trouble. The airline industry in the European Union was buoyant and thriving, but there will be a major collapse of the industry if intervention is not allowed. The incidents on 11 September are one reason for the difficulties, but another is the decline in general business over the past year because of the slow down of the economy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure, in terms of the management strategy Aer Lingus will announce in the near future, that Shannon Airport is not ignored or abandoned. Cork Airport is also important to the region but no changes have been made to the Cork schedule and only limited changes have been made to the Dublin schedule. Why is Shannon Airport always singled out for special attention? The Minister's constituency will be affected by difficulties at Shannon Airport and she must ensure that the airport is protected in any future management plans that Aer Lingus draws up.</P>

    <P>I think of the man who spoke earlier and I think of the way he left the health system in Ireland when he was the Minister for Health. I think of Mrs. Brigid McCole and the many thousands of women whom, through her, he disenfranchised because of his inability to grasp the issue and the inane way he dealt with it. I think of the way he left the medical services in Ireland. I am replying in a personal way because he dwelt on me considerably in a personal fashion. Deputy Noonan was part of a Cabinet that sponsored Deputy Lowry as the acclaimed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

      <P>I extend a message of sympathy to Mrs. Kathleen Cahill and her family. Bernie Cahill served this country, Aer Lingus and all the workers and he did a magnificent job during his tenure as chairman. This is the first public occasion I have had to speak about him. I was at his removal and I feel for his widow and family. He gave much of his time and expertise to serve Aer Lingus and he helped it through difficult times. I am sure other Members will join in that expression of sympathy.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the new chairman who has taken over the company at a serious time. He has attended to his job with great gusto and verve. I know he will continue to give it the close attention it demands.</P>
      <P>We are all still trying to come to terms with the results of the horrendous events of 11 September 2001. First, and most importantly, is the significant loss of life and the personal tragedies for numerous families from many nations around the world, including Ireland and, second, is the evolving economic consequences which are becoming more and more apparent daily, particularly for the aviation and travel sector. While Irish aviation as a whole has received a set back as a result of the events of 11 September, the critical issue facing us now is the future of Aer Lingus in the light of the grave financial situation facing the company. I will return to this vital issue in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will trace the sequence of events and the reaction of my Department to recent events immediately following the US terrorist attacks when the Federal Aviation Authority closed US airspace to all aircraft. In addition to grounding US domestic traffic, this halted all international traffic on the <Col N="741" /> transatlantic routes, including aircraft operating on routes to and from Ireland by Delta, Continental and Aer Lingus. For Aer Lingus, this resulted in its services on that Tuesday either being re-routed to Canada, recalled to Ireland or cancelled. US airspace reopened on Friday, 14 September 2001. Following the introduction of increased security measures, Aer Lingus operated a limited service on the following Saturday, all but one of the regular services on the Sunday with a full resumption of all transatlantic services the following Monday. Many people had their plans disrupted but all airlines worked as quickly and efficiently as possible to get people to their destinations given the dreadful and unexpected circumstances.</P>
    <P>The first issue of concern to my Department following the attacks was aviation security. We worked quickly to issue a special advisory notice to all Irish airports, airlines and private aviation security companies on the evening of the attacks requesting increased vigilance and care in all aspects of aviation security activities. As a result, security at airports was stepped up and additional gardaí were deployed. A special meeting of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee was convened on 12 September to review aviation security arrangements. This committee, chaired by my Department, comprises all relevant aviation and security interests. Its role is to advise the Government and the civil aviation industry of security policy for civil aviation, to recommend and review the effectiveness of security measures and to provide for co-ordination of the various interests involved. The committee has had meetings on several occasions since the attacks, one of which I attended on 17 September. It will continue to closely monitor developments.</P>
    <P>We also dealt with a critical aviation insurance problem that arose as a result of the aviation insurance underwriters capping third party war risks insurance at US$50 million. This, in effect, meant that airlines from 12 o'clock on that Monday night could not continue operations. The Government acted quickly to underwrite the gap in the missing cover and this scheme now covers Irish airlines, airports, air traffic service providers, essential aircraft maintenance companies, ground handlers and other airport related services. The indemnity will be for a period of one month within which it is hoped the insurance market will return to providing adequate cover. This issue will be kept under review. Emergency legislation to take effect from midnight on 24 September, which will be retrospective, will be introduced by the Government as soon as possible to give Oireachtas approval for the indemnification pledged.</P>
    <P>The security and insurance issues were the immediate consequences of the terrorist attacks, but it is now clear that the economic impact on the aviation sector, particularly for those involved in the transatlantic market, could be severe and long lasting and will change the structure of the <Col N="742" /> industry. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and I were at the leaders meeting on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday in the Attorney General's Office and our office. We worked throughout the weekend to ensure that the aeroplanes could fly after 12 o'clock on Monday evening. We did the same for the airports to ensure they could remain open. I thank the officials who worked continuously for four days and the Attorney General and my colleagues who worked closely with me to ensure the matter would be resolved, otherwise aeroplanes would not have been able to fly.</P>
    <P>The strategic importance of the aviation sector to the economic well being of the country has been well documented, particularly having regard to our island status and our position on the periphery of Europe. The aviation sector through the provision of good, reliable, competitive services to and from our main markets has made a major contribution to the growth in the economy. Since liberalisation in the early 1990s there has been a phenomenal growth in air travel with passenger throughput increasing from 7.8 million in 1990 to 17.9 million in 2000, an increase of 129%, at the three State airports over the past decade. This trend which everyone expected to continue in the future must now be carefully reviewed.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the growth experienced in Ireland over the past years was derived from a number of factors, including general economic development, increased and more focused marketing by tourism and other agencies, improved and more competitive tourism product, advent of low cost carriers, more services by non-Irish carriers but also significantly by the contribution of Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus, with its seven million passenger total in 2000, still delivers the biggest proportion of the traffic at our State airports. Its share of passengers on direct transatlantic services is in the region of 70% and this year the airline will carry in excess of one million passengers on Ireland-US routes. This illustrates the critical importance of Aer Lingus in supporting the tourism industry and the important and growing trade links with the US.</P>
    <P>Tourism sources now estimate that less that half the expected 300,000 US visitors who would holiday here in the last four months of this year are expected to travel. I welcome the initiative announced last Tuesday by Aer Lingus of a new $198 fare on offer between yesterday and 16 December for US originating passengers flying from JFK and Boston to Dublin and Shannon. It is difficult to predict the traffic situation on US routes in 2002 given the uncertainty which everyone faces about the US military response and the decision by Aer Lingus to cut services, but there is likely to be a dramatic reduction in US visitors to Ireland next year. Delta has also withdrawn from the Ireland-JFK route, at least for the winter season.</P>
    <P>I am advised that European markets have not been affected as badly as transatlantic ones. Nevertheless, I commend the action taken by low<Col N="743" /> cost operators to boost traffic on UK-European routes. I welcome and encourage every effort to develop and grow services to and from Ireland, and I will continue to do so. At my request, Aer Rianta has today announced that it is to extend its extensive discount scheme for airlines flying into State airports.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, Shannon and Cork operate zero airport charges for all new routes for a period of three years from commencement. Aer Rianta has now extended this scheme to Dublin Airport. In effect, there will be no airport charges for any new routes operating into Dublin, and the current three year scheme operating at Cork and Shannon airports is being extended to four years. I hope this will provide an incentive to carriers, and I believe it will.</P>
    <P>We have a very liberal policy in the aviation sector. In Europe, the aviation market is fully open as regards access to routes and fare setting. In the US, from the Irish side, the only major regulatory issue is the requirement to match</P>
    <P>Dublin services with services to Shannon and, from the US side, the restriction of services to certain key cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>The difficulties being experienced in Ireland and by Aer Lingus are not unique. All airlines with a significant transatlantic presence are experiencing a dramatic reduction in traffic and in forward bookings. Many are now in a perilous state, with a number facing bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Daily we hear about major world airlines announcing increased losses and responding immediately by drastically cutting capacity and jobs. In the US, American and United have cut jobs by 20,000 each, and Continental by 12,000. In Europe, British Airways, Virgin, SAS and Alitalia are laying off staff. We have also witnessed the collapse of Swissair, Sabena and, this morning, the stark news from KLM. Unfortunately, the list does not end there.</P>
    <P>It would be incorrect, however, to blame all the current ills solely on the terrorist attacks. It is clear that the global economic downturn had already begun to impact on the aviation industry worldwide before the events of 11 September. However, while the industry had problems, the situation became a crisis following the terrorist attacks. Of course, it is not only airlines that are being affected &ndash; aircraft manufacturers, leasing companies, airports and air traffic management providers, among others, are also affected by the fallout.</P>
    <P>Turning to Aer Lingus, the situation is very grave. The dramatic impact on the company of the events of 11 September can be gauged from the fact that transatlantic routes account for 40% of the airline's revenue and 60% of its profits. Aer Lingus has advised me &ndash; and reaffirmed it this morning &ndash; that booking activity has collapsed on transatlantic routes since 11 September. Current bookings are down 80% on last year and forward bookings to end December are expected <Col N="744" /> to be down 45% on last year. Similarly, on UK and European routes, booking activity is currently down 30% on last year with forward bookings to end December expected to be down by 10% on last year. Given the experts' view about no recovery before the third quarter of 2002, this makes for very gloomy prospects on the transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>This development is all the more discouraging for all concerned when the trading performance of Aer Lingus had been positive over the last number of years, boosted by the strong economic conditions. In 2000, the company recorded operating profits of £63 million. I wish to put that on the record because it is quite clear that Aer Lingus was in an extraordinarily healthy and positive trading environment less than six months ago. The company had passenger numbers of 7 million, an increase of almost 6% over 1999.</P>
    <P>While the events of 11 September had the most catastrophic effect on Aer Lingus, a number of internal and external factors had already begun to impact. These included industrial relations disputes, the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK and the deepening global economic downturn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last June, Aer Lingus indicated it was heading for a loss in 2001. I had my last meeting with the then chairman, the late Mr. Bernie Cahill, in early June. On that occasion, he envisaged the losses for the year 2001 would be of the nature of £25 million to £30 million, but he was confident that in 2002 the company would be able to trade out of it. He said Aer Lingus would be reviewing its anticipated losses in 2001.</P>
      <P>In July, due to the continuing economic downturn, which further reduced business travel and cargo traffic, the company advised an expected loss for the year 2001 in the region of £30 million to £35 million. The company advised that the review of operations started in June involved its entire operation and would be finalised in September in order to allow them to put in place a revised winter 2001 and summer 2002 schedule.</P>
      <P>On 6 September, Aer Lingus reported to my departmental officials on the outcome of the review. The company outlined an integrated package of measures designed to yield savings of £25 million to £30 million in 2002 from fleet reductions, operational efficiencies and reduced overheads. The capacity cutbacks included in that package were to be confined to European and domestic routes. The company indicated that it would continue to closely monitor the situation and if the downturn intensified more severe measures would have to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the catastrophic events of 11 September, Aer Lingus advised on 17 September that, on the basis of information received on forward bookings, it expected losses to rise to £70 million for 2001 and exceed £100 million next <Col N="745" /> year. The company immediately indicated that it was facing into a grave cash situation and, in fact, was likely to run out of cash early in 2002.</P>
    <P>The company immediately advised of additional cutbacks to address the serious situation. The main additional measures include the elimination of transatlantic services to Newark, which were formerly operating at six per week, and Baltimore which previously operated daily. Overall, the scale of the company's operations will be reduced by 25%. This means that the cost</P>
    <P>base must also be reduced by a minimum of 25%.</P>
    <P>On 18 September, the company announced a series of ten vital initiatives, all of which were relayed to the trades unions and made public. The cash situation is very serious. Aer Lingus management estimates that, even with an early implementation of the capacity and cost cuts announced last week and prudent management, the remaining cash reserves will last until January-February 2002 at best. The company's management is continuously assessing a rapidly evolving situation and this cash crisis could be advanced from the January-February timeframe I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>There has been some public comment about significant cash reserves held by Aer Lingus but this is not the case. At end December 2000, Aer Lingus had cash, deposits and liquid resources totalling £650 million. Of this amount, £350 million are restricted deposits which are not available to fund Aer Lingus's trading operations. These are specific amounts placed on deposit, legally secured, and can only be used to repay specific aircraft loans and to finance lease obligations on their due dates. Along with my officials, I have discussed with Aer Lingus the possibility of freeing up some of those restricted deposits. The company has advised that it is examining the matter but, at best, this will release in the region of £30 million which could offer only limited relief in terms of cash flow.</P>
    <P>The remaining cash balances totalling £300 million, which were freely available to the business, were reduced by £115 million down to £185 million in the eight months to end August due to committed expenditure on fleet allied to a depressed trading performance. This amount is expected to be fully depleted by early 2002. There is no doubt that we are facing a crisis in Aer Lingus. In the coming days the board will present me with proposals which outline the full extent of the difficulties and its recommended solutions. I expect to receive focused proposals which will have at their core a basis for a viable business going forward.</P>
    <P>We face a difficult challenge in the weeks and months ahead. I believe that Aer Lingus has a future, but securing that future will require a major change in the structure and focus of the airline and significant changes for management and staff. It will mean a complete overhaul and redesign of the airline to give a more cost efficient and flexible operation capable of adapting to the volatile and changing aviation world. The com<Col N="746" /> pany has already sadly indicated that almost 700 temporary staff will be let go over the coming weeks and is now examining the implications for permanent staff of the 25% cut in scale. One of my key aims is to protect the maximum number of sustainable jobs. That means looking at the big picture and taking action to ensure that we will have an airline, however altered, which will have a basis from which to grow in the future when markets improve.</P>
    <P>The question of State aid has properly been raised by Deputies. There is a clear position on such aid. Neither the European Commission nor the Government would support any return to a regime of State aid for unviable airlines.</P>

      <P>However, it is essential that there is no distortion of competition either in the internal European market or in any market, including the transatlantic market, where EU airlines operate. In light of the US Government's announcement of a package of measures involving £5 billion in direct grants to airlines and £10 billion in loan guarantees, it is necessary for the European Commission to assess the impact of such aid on European airlines.</P>
      <P>I held discussions on the difficulties in the aviation sector with the President of the EU Transport Council and the European Commission last Monday in Brussels. We had a detailed meeting with Commission officials and with Mme. Isobel Durant who is Chairman of the Transport Council of Ministers. She was engaged at that time with the forthcoming situation regarding Sabena. However, we had a long meeting at which we discussed what the Commission will put forward to the Transport Council next Tuesday week. I told her that we were in a unique situation as the only island country in the Union, that we wished to continue to operate our State airline as a viable entity in a restructured manner and that I would make these points in a clear and focused manner at the Transport Council meeting.</P>
      <P>I relayed the same message to the Commission officials who I met before my meeting with the President of the Transport Council. The next Transport Council meeting will take place on Tuesday week and the first item on the agenda will be the financial crisis within the European aviation sector. The matter will also be discussed at the next ECOFIN Council scheduled for the same day. If a limited form of compensation is proposed, I expect and hope it will be supported on the basis that each state would make it available on a non-discriminatory basis to viable airlines under guidelines agreed at European level and in respect of specific categories of loss directly associated with the events of 11 September and after.</P>

      <P>Our objective of securing a viable future for Aer Lingus will not be an easy task. However, let there be no doubt that the Government and I want a strong and vibrant Aer Lingus going forward. I acknowledge the role played by Aer Lingus over the years in the development of Ireland's trade and tourism sectors. I also acknowledge the contribution and sacrifices of its employees over those years in enabling the airline to fulfil that role. These are difficult times but let me assure the House that I will work with all parties to save this airline.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting with 24 members of the central representatives committee of Aer Lingus unions on 24 September 2001. Each day since I have been in contact with at least one of the unions or with the CRC. I gave them details of what I would argue when in Brussels and reported to them when I returned. In turn Aer Lingus management has engaged directly and almost daily with the trade union executive. Nothing is being kept from anyone. An open case is being made. It is clear to everyone that there is a crisis.</P>

      <P>I thank Fine Gael for raising this important matter and giving the House an opportunity to address it. The Minister's speech was full of waffle with no details as to how this crisis is to be dealt with. It is amazing that she would come into the House and give a list of the meetings which might happen or have happened. That is all we got from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;well being of the country;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash; calls on the Government and European Union to recognise the unique strategic importance of Aer Lingus to this country as an island heavily dependent on tourism and as the only member state of the European Union with no land link to the European mainland;</P>
      <P>&ndash; calls on the Government to work with management and unions to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus and the retention of the maximum number of jobs; and</P>
      <P>&ndash; noting the damage that has been done to the morale of Aer Lingus workers by the uncertainty regarding the future of the company, calls on the Government to state unequivocally that there will be no change in the ownership structure of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No Minister with responsibility for Public Enterprise has inflicted so much damage on the State sector as the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. Of all our State companies, she seems to have singled out Aer Lingus for particularly appalling treatment. This fact was laid bare in the House last June during the last substantial debate on the future of Aer Lingus. The Minister huffed and puffed from the Government benches, but she had no real reply to the charge. Her performance during that debate was an admission of incompetence and failure.</P>
      <P>The challenges facing Aer Lingus in the wake of the murderous attack on the people of New York and Washington are immense. Given the Government's record and the record of the Minister for Public Enterprise in particular, I have grave doubts if they can rise to the challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has proposed an amendment to the Government motion which outlines solid principles for future action. It is intended to remove the waffle and prevarication that forms a vast part of the Government amendment. If our amendment were accepted, it would show that however late in the day the Government is willing <Col N="749" /> to take seriously, its responsibilities to the staff and customers of Aer Lingus. Rejection of the Labour Party amendment by the Government will signal there is no change in policy and that a petty and vindictive attitude will still dominate policy.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment is little more than a rehash of the appointments diaries of the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance. It tells this House and the workers and customers of Aer Lingus nothing of the Government's policy towards the national carrier after 11 September. There is a belated and grudging recognition that the Government's desire to sell off Aer Lingus as soon as possible regardless of the price is not possible. There is, however, no recognition of the damage this policy has inflicted on the company over many months. Neither is the policy jettisoned. It is not now an issue in the current circumstances. Those are weasel words from a Government without direction. Neither did the Government inform the House of its approach to negotiations with the EU Commission at this critical time for the airline industry here and world wide.</P>
    <P>Luckily not all politicians or political parties have demonstrated the same degree of lethargy and obfuscation that this Government confuses with policy. My colleague in the European Parliament, Deputy De Rossa, this week asked a question that goes to the heart of the current debate about State aid to airlines in the EU. The reply to the question is revealing and presents an opportunity to bring some stability and security to Aer Lingus during these turbulent times. The reply quotes Article 87.2(f2&gt;b) of the EC Treaty, which states that member states may be authorised by the Commission to grant aids to make good the damage caused by exceptional occurrences. The reply goes on to state that on 24 September the Commission wrote to member states highlighting their duty to notify in advance the type of State aid or other financial measures envisaged by them. Will the Minister inform the House today if the Government has given a comprehensive reply to that letter and, if so, indicate its contents? It seems that the only obstacle to assisting Aer Lingus out of its problems is the Minister and her inability to make a decision or, having made one, her failure to carry it through.</P>
    <P>We deserve to know more than the appointment schedules of the Minister. We need to know what Government policy is, what sum of money in grant aid to Aer Lingus is proposed and what is the Government's attitude to other airline operators in the State. Answers must be given to these questions.</P>
    <P>The grounding of the Swissair fleet and the resulting chaos into which Sabena has been thrown is proof positive of the perilous state in which European airlines find themselves. Foot dragging and confusion which seem to permeate Government policy have potentially disastrous consequences for Aer Lingus at this time. A clear <Col N="750" /> strategy that has the support of the management and the unions in Aer Lingus is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>One of the main causes for the confusion that exists within the Government is the ideological opposition of the Progressive Democrats and my constituency colleague, Deputy McCreevy, to the prospect of State aid and their opposition to the very existence of State enterprise. It is a corrosive influence in Cabinet at present. I seriously doubt if the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, given her record, or the Taoiseach, given his cowardice on such matters, will present a coherent argument against the standard bearers of Thatcherism and Thatcherite privatisation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes it is right and proper that the Government, which is the shareholder in Aer Lingus, should provide emergency capital to ensure the survival of the airline in these unprecedented times. The EU Commission in its reply to Deputy De Rossa made it clear that it expects such to happen. The Minister now needs to make a decision and to make an application to the Commission so that it can assess that application. Until that is done nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>In 1993 Labour fought tooth and nail to ensure that Aer Lingus would receive the capital injection it needed to overcome and transcend the very grave crisis facing it then. Labour's determination provided the capital and the dedication of the work force over the following years succeeded in turning around Aer Lingus so that it became one of the finest airlines in Europe and a member of the One World Alliance.</P>
    <P>We are living in exceptional times. I have every confidence that the management, unions and workers in Aer Lingus can ride out the current uncertainty and ensure that our national carrier continues to play an essential role in the economic and social life of this country.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the challenges before us. Take a minute to imagine what would become of this nation if the worse possible scenario, a fate such as that which befell Sabena last week, were to happen to Aer Lingus. What then of our tourist trade? What then of the families who use Aer Lingus to keep in touch with their sons, daughters and grandchildren across the globe? What would be the effect on our economy nationally, let alone the economy of north county Dublin, Shannon and Cork? It would be a catastrophe. It is worthwhile to consider that scenario to put in context the vital role Aer Lingus has played in the life of this nation. It is a role that the State should and must protect in these unprecedented times.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has set out a clear set of principles which, if followed, would ensure the survival of Aer Lingus over the coming months. Nothing less is acceptable. Anything less could have dramatic consequences for the national carrier and for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our primary concern is the very survival of the airline. There is a real danger that it will not survive. Those are the words of Mr. Tom McInerney, corporate manager of Aer <Col N="751" /> Lingus in Shannon, when he addressed the Mid-West Regional Authority last Monday. That is how critical the situation is. Supportive intervention by the Government is now a matter of acute urgency. I did not detect that urgency in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The US Government, the home of competition and free enterprise, is willing to put millions of dollars into saving its commercial airlines. It would be a travesty if our Government and the EU did not take the same supportive approach to our national carrier.</P>
      <P>EU policy on competition cannot be allowed to supersede EU policy on solidarity, cohesion and regional development, policies which are much closer to the core of what the EU was set up to achieve and which precedes by many years the recently seeming all powerful god of competition.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome, as did my colleague Deputy Stagg, indications given to my colleague Deputy De Rossa and John Cushnahan that the Transport Commissioner is sympathetic to the argument that the attacks in the US constitute special circumstances for State airlines. The Minister must act on this now.</P>
      <P>The strategic importance of the survival of Aer Lingus is crucial to our national interest because air access is a vital link to us as an island nation, east to our European neighbours and west to the US and beyond.</P>
      <P>The thousands of jobs currently under threat by the announcement of a 25% reduction in service will be followed by many more unless remedial action is taken immediately. However, tens of thousands of other jobs are also at risk in tourism, manufacturing and service industries directly dependent on regular air transport.</P>
      <P>There is grave concern in the Shannon region, a region whose prosperity has been built around airline access. Shannon International Airport was a brave, although some thought foolhardy, concept half a century ago. It has been used since as the catalyst for development, particularly of a strong multinational technology sector as well as other manufacturing and tourism. Some years ago an independent study indicated that 33,000 jobs were dependent on the continued success of Shannon Airport. That number has undoubtedly risen since then.</P>
      <P>The effect of the tragedy on 11 September has been disastrous for Shannon in particular. Some 35% of Shannon passengers are transatlantic passengers compared to 7% in Dublin and none in Cork. Already we have been told that Aer Lingus is shedding one third of its transatlantic aircraft and routes. Shannon-Newark and Shannon-Baltimore are already gone. To the east, Shannon-Paris and Shannon-Belfast have been axed. The early morning and late evening connecting flights to Dublin are to go too, making an overnight in Dublin an extra cost on passengers going from Shannon to European destinations. Deputy Noonan and Deputy Deenihan today listed further imminent route cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I cannot over emphasise how devastating these decisions are for the mid-west and the western seaboard. The terrorist attacks in the US have been a crucial factor in the route cancellations by Aer Lingus, certainly in relation to Shannon. The Shannon corporate manager said:</P>
    <P>Between September 11 and 25, we received more cancellations than bookings. That tells its own story. On Monday, 24 September compared to the same day last year, our London bookings were down 45% for October, 44% for November and 30% for December. Transatlantic bookings were down 63% for October, November bookings fell by 52% and there was a shortfall of 65% in bookings for December.</P>
    <P>These facts and the strategic importance of airline access to Ireland are more than enough ammunition for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to win her case with her EU colleagues if she argues it with conviction. The Minister must consider no other outcome except State support for Aer Lingus at this crucial time. Aer Lingus management, unions and workers also have serious work to do to adapt to the changed environment but the Minister must engage with them immediately in a real way, now that positive signals have been received from the EU.</P>
    <P>My colleagues will spell out the potential job losses in the Dublin area if effective action is not taken. For the mid-west and the west the ripples extend far wider than the environs of the airport. I urge Deputies, particularly those in Government parties, and Ministers who represent constituencies in these regions to speak out and to ensure that vital access to Shannon Airport is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Labour Party conference in Cork at the weekend an emergency motion was unanimously passed. It directed that the Taoiseach and the Government take the lead among European governments in demanding that State aid be authorised to deal with the current crisis in the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>This motion was the result of a number of factors. First is the lack of leadership and commitment at Government level in dealing with the crisis that has developed. The prospect of massive job losses and the implications of such massive redundancies for the regions, particularly north County Dublin, will be devastating for the economy. Not a town or village in my constituency will be unaffected. Another factor is the possibility that Aer Lingus would go under. Such an event would have implications for the tourism industry, on which we are heavily dependent. When the aviation industry improves, as it will, it is imperative that we have a strong Aer Lingus in operation which will be ready to provide the service on which this island nation depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister today showed the lack of commitment to Aer Lingus which has been evident to <Col N="753" /> the staff in recent years. Her determination over the years to sell the company, notwithstanding her praise for the company today, has undermined morale and the efforts of management and staff. Much of the work done in restructuring and rebuilding the company in the early and mid-1990s has been undermined by this Government. The problem is made infinitely worse by the fact that we do not have a united Government. Various Ministers have come forward in recent months and stated that they were not in favour of State aid for Aer Lingus even though a protocol of the EU treaty provides for that.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an ongoing problem within the Government in taking the leadership role that is required. If the Minister cannot do it, she should step aside and let the Taoiseach take over. He has taken over everything else in relation to it.</P>

      <P>A clear message should emerge from this debate. The Government must come to the aid of Aer Lingus. The Minister said a pruned down company is required. When the staff become involved in that and in working once again for the future of this company there must be a specific guarantee that the company is not for sale. That message must be conveyed. It is inherent in the Labour Party amendment to the motion this afternoon. Nothing less is acceptable. My colleagues will expand on that point.</P>
      <P>The Government has not delivered to date and has been unconvincing. It must deliver on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Ryan, spoke in graphic detail about the consequences of the failure of Aer Lingus for the northside of Dublin. There are probably about 1,000 Aer Lingus workers living in my constituency and I do not need to have explained what the effect on the local community would be of the loss of that number of jobs in either the immediate or the medium term future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I obviously wear my constituency hat like other Members, we must also be aware of what the national consequences would be of the failure of our national airline. It simply cannot be reasonably contended that other airlines could in the short-term pick up the slack and perform the services currently provided by Aer Lingus. It cer<Col N="754" /> tainly cannot be suggested that any domestic airline would be interested in taking up that slack and putting those services in place. Furthermore, nobody has persuasively suggested that other international airlines could do so in the short-term or beyond.</P>
    <P>There would, therefore, be a significant loss to this country in having access to it simply terminated for many people. The damage for business and tourism would be considerable. That cannot be allowed to happen, particularly if we are told that the primary reason we cannot prevent it is EU State aid rules or competition legislation.</P>
    <P>We must get back to basics. I accept in principle that the State aid rules are in place to encourage fair and free competition and that that is a good thing. However, the case can and must be persuasively made that this basic part of our infrastructure must be treated in a more sensible fashion. The airline industry is extremely cyclical, as anybody who has watched the industry over the past ten years knows. It goes up and down and the troughs can be quite low. There simply must be the capacity, within the State aid rules and competition legislation, to allow assistance to be provided in a trough or disaster of this magnitude. This is even more true at this time because, in a sense, the problem is not of the airline industry's doing but is a reflection of the crisis in the international order.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the Government has been utterly unacceptable. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment immediately offered the gut reaction we expect from them. They said State aid was not possible and that they could not interfere with free competition. It is possible. What was particularly strange was that when the Minister for Finance went to the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels he found, I suspect to his surprise, that most of his colleagues in the European Union took a different view. They were more than willing to contemplate the possibility of state aid. They know the consequences of not doing so are potentially disastrous, not just for Ireland but for the European Union. How remarkable, too, that the President and the authorities of the United States, where competition law is at least as stringent as it is here, had no difficulty in saying that a total of $15 billion would be provided in terms of underwriting loans or in direct state aid.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow the indecision within the Government and the competition rules to be used in a fashion that could, directly or indirectly, lead to the failure of national airlines. Is it not remarkable that Swissair, which was grounded for 24 hours, got an immediate promise of assistance from the Swiss government, notwithstanding that the government is merely a minority shareholder in that airline?</P>
    <P>The ownership of Aer Lingus is a bigger issue. I concur with others who have said we should not have contemplated selling off such an important part of our infrastructure and an industry which <Col N="755" /> regularly goes through cyclical difficulties. This was not a good idea and I am happy to see the Minister appears to have turned her back on it. Unfortunately, much damage has been done in the intervening two years since the Minister put a &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign up on the airline although she did not have a clear idea of how she would move it forward.</P>
    <P>We need clear leadership from the Government. With that, it will be possible to make a case in Brussels. As Deputy Stagg has already made clear, the Commission is open to the idea of allowing for exceptional aid, whether for security, insurance cover or otherwise. We must push that open door.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On his radio programme this morning, Pat Kenny posed the question of how one airline can make substantial profits and have a huge capitalisation while another &ndash; he clearly intended Aer Lingus &ndash; is making major losses and has debts stacking up. The question was posed on a false premise. Reports of Aer Lingus's performance in recent years show that the pain borne in the 1990s by the airline's work force on the north side of Dublin and in Cork and Limerick has produced a very efficient airline. Pat Kenny also ignored the effect of the dastardly events of 11 September in New York and Washington which changed the nature of aviation forever.</P>
      <P>One of the key tasks of Aer Lingus, which it has discharged faithfully and well particularly in the past decade, has been to keep strong the connections between the north and west side of Dublin, Limerick and Cork with regard to IT and high technology industries. Our capital city is twinned with San José near San Francisco and there has been a constant interchange of technology and personnel which has had a major impact on the creation of the Celtic tiger economy. This part of Aer Lingus's operation has experienced a catastrophic collapse of bookings. This morning, even British Airways admitted that its bookings are down 30%.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is the only major Irish airline for which the needs of this island and this economy are paramount and the only airline to support the key industrial and economic aims of the national economy. I wish Ryanair well in its operations, but comparisons with that airline must take into account the special deals it has done with regional European airports and the large amount of out-sourcing and subcontracting done by the company. It must also take into account the determination of large investors to smash national airlines throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the days after 11 September, the United States government moved quickly to help the great American airlines to bear the costs of extra security on board aircraft and at airports. The famous security procedures of companies such as El Al do not come cheap. The EU Commission must be prepared to do the same in this extra<Col N="756" /> ordinary situation, particularly with the extra cost of the connection between Europe and the United States.</P>
    <P>For the past four years the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have prevaricated about the future ownership and operation of Aer Lingus. I have a high personal regard for Deputy O'Rourke but as a Minister she has been remiss in a large area of her duties. One of the saddest elements of the Minister's record is her failure to deliver on the new deal for pensioners, which was an absolute commitment in the election campaign of 1997. Deputy Wright and his colleagues have let those pensioners down and that will be remembered in a few months time when we canvass for votes on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This morning I tried to raise the issue of the north side of Dublin where an economic melt down is going on as we enter the recession into which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are leading us. We have seen the disasters of Gateway 2000 where 2,000 jobs have been lost, and not 900 as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment claimed while the House was on holidays. We have seen the failure of Seronix. Young men and women who took advantage of the economic boom to gain high technology training are now walking the streets of my constituency following the downsizing of that company. I am sure the same situation prevails in areas of Limerick and Cork where the aviation industry is so important.</P>
    <P>To prevent this economic melt down from getting worse, I ask the Taoiseach to take a number of steps which are vitally important for the regions most affected in the east and south of the country. I particularly ask him to set up a jobs task force with the county managers concerned to try to bring forward a plan to sustain the jobs which exist and replace those which have been lost. I ask him, instead of adopting the obsolete 1980s position of the Minister for Finance, to go to Europe and demand the resources needed by the aviation industry in the north side of Dublin and in Cork and Limerick. In these changed circumstances which the chairman of the United States Federal Reserve has described as extraordinary, the Taoiseach must bring forward supports to enable the vital interests of the national airlines of Europe, and in our own case Aer Lingus, to continue.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the motion.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Wright and Daly.</P>
      <P>The developing situation in Aer Lingus is potentially disastrous and could have widespread implications for employment throughout north Dublin. This is seen against the background of more than 1,000 job losses already announced in Gateway 2000 last August. I call on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to take all possible measures, including the provision of emergency funding to ensure the future of the airline and its thousands of employees.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus is a vital semi-State organisation. It is the State airline and the Government is the main shareholder in it. Its strategic importance for an island nation from a trade and tourism view point cannot be over estimated. It provides a crucial transatlantic service. It employs approximately 6,500 people, making it a focal point for the economy of the north side of the capital city.</P>
      <P>Even prior to 11 September, Aer Lingus faced serious difficulties. Industrial disputes, the foot and mouth crisis, the down turn in the US economy and increasing fuel costs meant that the airline was already facing a major crisis. Losses of £70 million for this year and a deficit of £100 million in 2002 had been predicted. Yet, the terrorist attacks on the United States changed everything again. A dramatic slump in air passengers and future bookings mean that many airlines, including Sabena, Swissair and KLM as well as Aer Lingus, now face a major battle to survive.</P>
      <P>We are now talking about the very survival of Aer Lingus and we must do everything possible to ensure this. We will not be forgiven by the employees of Aer Lingus or by the citizens of this State if we do not put measures in place to ensure the future of our airline.  A rescue package must be prepared by Aer Lingus management in consultation with the unions as soon as possible. I understand this will be done shortly. Operations have been cut back by 25% already. I understand pay rises of 5.5%, due under the PPF, may not be paid. There are rumours that 700 seasonal jobs may be lost and that a further 1,200 permanent jobs are at risk. It is a disaster. Redundancies must be kept to an absolute minimum and the Government must intervene to ensure that a satisfactory package of voluntary redundancies and early retirement is put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for State aid is compelling. The federal Government in the United States has announced a £15 million package for domestic airlines there, which puts EU airlines at serious disadvantage. The EU must respond to exceptional circumstances by allowing State aid to be given to national airlines. I understand that EU Transport Ministers are to meet on 16 October. I <Col N="758" /> welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has opened discussions with the EU Transport Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency to pave the way for an injection of funds. I welcome the Government amendment which states that a change in the ownership of Aer Lingus is not an issue in the current circumstances. Present difficulties will have to be dealt with before a change can be considered.</P>
    <P>A strong management team needs to be put in place at Aer Lingus. Poor management leads to industrial relations difficulties, as we have seen. Aer Lingus can survive if this change is brought about in this area. I have no doubt that the Government will not be found wanting on this issue. Aer Lingus was saved by a £175 million package on a previous occasion and it can be made viable again. I appeal to all in the House not to make Aer Lingus a political football, as to do so will not help.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Broughan said earlier, sniping from Ryanair on the sidelines will not help. Aer Lingus and Ryanair are very different airlines. Aer Lingus is the State airline, with all that involves. It provides a vital transatlantic service for the country and has a social dimension. The no frills, low cost and low fares model simply does not apply in this case.</P>
    <P>The case for State aid for Aer Lingus is compelling. I welcome the moves taken by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in this regard, including her commitment to remove the Bill currently before the Seanad in relation to Aer Lingus from the Order Paper. It clearly demonstrates that she is taking a proactive role. I have no doubt that for all our sakes and for the sake of the nation, Aer Lingus will be saved. It has a future and will go from strength to strength once it overcomes its current difficulties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's statement of commitment to the restructuring of the national airline this morning. I represent the Dublin North constituency, where economic and social growth has been based on the aviation industry, particularly the proximity of Dublin Airport. The towns of Portmarnock, Malahide and Swords, often regarded as the seventh hangar, have developed to their present economic status as a result of the support of the aviation industry, especially Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to the Government's amendment. The strategic importance of the aviation sector has been well explained here today and has been supported by all speakers. It was interesting to read economists in today's newspapers wondering if, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, we need a national airline to support economic growth and to facilitate the record exports we currently enjoy. I strongly believe there is such a need for a national airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the sacrifices that have been made by Aer Lingus workers in recent years in order <Col N="759" /> to restore the profitability of the company. Only two years ago, the annual report of Aer Lingus showed profit growth of over 11% and total profits of 79 million, much of which was due to the sacrifices made by the workforce in the 1990s. Unfortunately, Aer Lingus was hit by events entirely outside its control. Foot and mouth disease had a devastating effect on the company and the downturn in the global economy led to increased fuel costs. I have to say that I think some of the industrial action that was taken, particularly the Friday strikes, was detrimental to the company. I took a large number of telephone calls from people who were very disappointed because their holidays or business activity were disrupted. The Friday strikes had a devastating marketing effect on Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Part of the amendment before us relates to the restructuring currently taking place within Aer Lingus. I attended the recent SIPTU conference with colleagues who are in the House at the moment. The debate centred on the future ownership of the company. I argued, and was supported by David Begg and Des Geraghty, that the question of ownership is not the most important one. The most important issue for Aer Lingus at the moment is survival. I am pleased that the Minister has responded to the request that I made to her and to the Taoiseach to remove ownership from the agenda. I welcome the fact that a Bill that was before the Seanad has been taken from the Order Paper and the legislative programme.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey said, speakers at the SIPTU conference called for political parties, unions and management to work together in coalition. I welcome the fact that between ten and 12 working groups are putting together a restructure package, to be brought to a board meeting next Thursday, which hopefully will lead to the survival of the company. I hope decisions will be taken soon. Without the restructuring of Aer Lingus, we may be debating its viability and survival in its present form in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I support Members who have made the case for funding. It was interesting, following the 11 September disaster, that President Bush immediately announced federal aid for national airlines. I do not dispute his right to do so, but in recent years the United States Government has strongly argued with the European Commission that, under competition rules, state funding for national airlines should not be allowed. I am worried by statistics that show that 40% of Aer Lingus' revenue and 60% of its profits come from transatlantic routes. I have strongly argued with my Cabinet colleagues that we have a strong case for providing State funding on the basis of competition. The only competition faced by Aer Lingus on transatlantic routes comes from US carriers. It is vital that the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance make the strongest case possible on the grounds of competition, fair play <Col N="760" /> and a level playing pitch. I strongly believe that will happen.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by President Bush's announcement yesterday about redundancies, funding of health contributions and the retraining of workers will soon be part of our debate on Aer Lingus workers. Two of my Cabinet colleagues will be making a strong case for emergency funding at EU meetings in the next fortnight. I have no doubt that the funding will be forthcoming. It is hard to keep up, on Teletext or otherwise, with the fallout at the moment in relation to jobs. This morning KLM announced that 2,500 workers are to be let go and that 12,000 are to be put on short-term work and wage reductions. The daily impact of recent events on the aviation sector is most worrying for everyone.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise other issues which worry those of us who support the aviation sector. The fallout regarding Aer Lingus involves the company next door to it in Dublin Airport, FLS, formerly TEAM Aer Lingus. That company is worried by the downturn and the fact that 25% of Aer Lingus aircraft are grounded and more may be grounded soon. The cancellations of Virgin contracts will also cause great difficulties for that company. It is vitally important that we are seen to support the national airline, which is the main contract FLS has.</P>
    <P>Aviation pensioners were mentioned this morning and that battle is neither won nor lost &ndash; it is ongoing. Announcements to be made in the not too distant future may very well make the position of such pensioners a subject of debate at the highest level. All of us on the Fianna Fáil side are raising this issue and support the need for a just and equitable pension to be given to aviation pensioners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment made by the Minister on behalf of the Government, that the Government is four square behind a restructured Aer Lingus and will support the national airline in the interests of the economy and its workers. Those of us who represent the Dublin north area must work to ensure job losses are minimal and to offer support in bringing the company back to profit. Its management and workforce brought in 79 million for the year 2000. With the support of Government and a restructured management Aer Lingus can get back to profit and assure the long-term future viability of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inevitable that, in the aftermath of the horrific atrocities in the United States of 11 September, there would be immediate repercussions for international aviation. American Airlines, United Airlines, Continental, Swissair, Virgin and every other airline in the world is faced with enormous losses in terms of passengers, traffic and business and we in Ireland could not escape that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aftermath of the Gulf War brought something similar, though not with the same immediate, devastating effect. It took some considerable time before the aviation business recovered its <Col N="761" /> confidence and before people had the confidence to travel. In the long-term, when these matters of international terrorism are dealt with &ndash; and the sooner the better &ndash; we will see a return of confidence among the travelling public. People will probably go back slowly to the international routes and international travel will resume. However, the immediate short-term problems are ones we must face speedily, although we need to plan for the long-term. I am not sure it is wise for the management of Aer Lingus to almost abandon the north Atlantic routes. As the Minister said, that is where Aer Lingus makes 60% of its profits and does 40% of its business. The drive to restore confidence will be international and we should be part of that; we should endeavour to salvage what we can from the transatlantic business which is so important to Aer Lingus and other airlines.</P>
    <P>We saw the implications of events in British Airways, where 7,000 to 10,000 jobs are being lost and where passenger numbers declined by 60% in the first few days after the tragic events in the United States. The feeling in a situation like this would be that in the long-term business will gradually creep up and that we will be in a position to restore that traffic. It is critical not to have a vacuum between now and that recovery and it is essential that we provide the necessary support and finance for companies like Aer Lingus to get them through this difficult period.</P>
    <P>I highlight the impact Aer Lingus has on Shannon, where it spends approximately £40 million, not to mention all the spin-offs, for example, 15,000 meals are provided annually on Aer Lingus flights, so there will be an effect on flight kitchens and those involved in Aer Rianta, as well as the car hire and traffic business. It will be devastating for the region and it is impossible to calculate the impact it will have. That was why, some days after these events occurred, I appealed to the Government and the Minister in particular to immediately establish a task force at Shannon to examine the impact this would have across a range of activities and endeavour to put a committee in place which would respond to the crisis and which would set down a formula to minimise the effect of these devastating losses as well as steering the region through this difficult and precarious time.</P>
    <P>There is also a necessity to invoke the public service obligations regarding Shannon and to provide the funding that can be given under existing regulations. As far as I am aware there are no European Commission difficulties with that so I appeal to the Minister to apply the service obligations for the Shannon area and to provide the funding necessary to meet those obligations. Also, it is possible under EU regulations to support peripheral regional airports and Shannon should benefit from whatever funding is available to other regional airports.</P>
    <P>These are my proposals: to get a task force to look at the implications and to minimise the effects; to take action on the public service obli<Col N="762" /> gations the Minister has; to look at Shannon's peripheral status and the impact the slowdown would have on the region and to make sure that in the immediate aftermath we have financial support to continue business at Shannon. Not only should we continue business at Shannon but funding should be organised from other Ministers to enable those in the marketing area to get out into the marketplace and make good the losses that have already been predicted for next year.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that at this time of year there is a traditional fall-off in business. Most of our tourism business is of a seasonal nature, not all of it but a lot of it, although we have been trying to minimise that seasonality over the last few years with various initiatives. There is now a necessity for a major initiative to make up whatever losses we will suffer next year. This has always been a slack period, particularly in the regions, and it is a time when planning can be undertaken. There is now urgency in providing additional funding to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Bord Fáilte so they can embark on fairly dramatic advertising campaigns and we will be in a position, when the impact of this begins to wear off, where we are capable of bringing the dynamic approach of the regions to tourism back into play.</P>
    <P>The impact will be dramatic in the next few months. Thousands of people are losing their jobs already in Aer Lingus and that will put severe pressures on the company and not just its financial capabilities. It is also necessary for Aer Lingus to streamline its management. We all regret the tragic demise of its chairman but at this time it is necessary to have a chief executive and a chairman working actively in Aer Lingus to plan its future strategy.</P>
    <P>It is important that a chief executive be appointed immediately. I have tremendous respect for Larry Stanley and the highest regard for Tom McInerney whom I compliment on the work he is doing in Shannon. Dynamic management is required at this time if we are to restore confidence to a shattered business. The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that happens. It is possible to make up the ground we lose in other areas in order that the anticipated devastating effect on hotels, guest houses, car hire companies, coach tours and charter business can be made up from other markets.</P>
    <P>The issue of pension funds which has been the cause of so much anxiety to so many people who gave years of dedicated service to Aer Lingus should be rectified. Some people in my constituency have provided lifelong dedicated service to Aer Lingus and the State. It is a scandalous disgrace that at this stage of their lives, they must resort to visiting Ministers and politicians on deputations to get their just desserts.</P>

This matter must be resolved as it is not fair to the people in question and their families. As Deputy Owen said, we owe these people a debt of gratitude. Although I have considerable respect for Deputy Owen, that was the only constructive aspect of her entire contribution to which I listened carefully. I am not surprised she has been consigned to the back benches as she did not advance a single constructive proposal as to how this matter could be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wright is sharing his time with me and I appreciate that. We, in Shannon, are adamant that this temporary setback will not adversely affect the region. We will fight to restore business and safeguard our airline. Shannon airport employees will go through a difficult period, as will other airport employees throughout the world but these difficulties should be short lived.</P>
      <P>During last night's debate on the atrocities in America, we witnessed Deputy Gormley's ambivalence about American aircraft utilising Shannon in an effort to beat the terrorists who sent thousands of people to early graves and who are responsible for the difficulties in the airline business internationally. Some people in the Labour Party and the Green Party, in particular, appear to be ambivalent as to whether we should deal with the terrorist threat. Further attacks are perhaps inevitable. It is not difficult to imagine what may happen if there are further terrorist attacks and I am baffled by the ambivalence displayed. Deputy Gormley criticised the Minister for Foreign Affairs for stating that there cannot be any neutrality in matters of terrorism. There is no neutrality in these matters and we, in Shannon, will not be neutral either. Having represented the region for 29 years, I want to put that on record.</P>
      <P>The current difficulties in Shannon are not insurmountable. We, in Fianna Fáil, will support Shannon and I assure the Minister of my full backing in taking whatever action is deemed necessary. We will not, as a former Fine Gael Leader predicted, allow the rabbits to run over Shannon airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>He must have been sorely disappointed by the Minister's speech in which she did not refer to any of the difficulties at Shannon where a decision has been taken to cut services including 42 flights from Shannon to Dublin, ten flights to Baltimore, ten flights to Newark, four flights to Paris and ten to Belfast. How can people in Shannon be confident when the bulk of services have been cut in Shannon with a minimal reduction in Cork and no reduction at all in</P>
      <P>Dublin? British Airways, which was Aer Lingus's competition on the Belfast-Shannon-US route, has pulled out of Belfast and I cannot understand why Aer Lingus pulled out too. Why does it not continue to provide a service to the people of Ireland about whom the Government professes to care so much? It took time to build up services and to gain people's confidence but, with one wave of his hand, the new chairman from the AIB has decided that Shannon is best able to withstand the cuts. I wonder whether this is a political gesture although I hope it is not. I hope the Government has reliable information that its three seats are so safe that it can make these cuts in County Clare.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus employees in Shannon have already experienced severe income cuts and have foregone substantial salary increases to sustain the services at Shannon. When Deputy Cowen held the transport portfolio, he outlined his intention to set aside £1 million towards a task force although we were worn out trying to ascertain when it would be provided. Given the current Minister's prevarication, it is unlikely that she will set up a task force and there will be no hope at all for Shannon. The people of Shannon feel abused by the decisions taken by senior management in Dublin. There does not appear to be any continuity in the Minister's policies &ndash; when the regulator legislation was going through the House, the Minister stated that the Government's regional policies must be acknowledged particularly in regard to airlines such as Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The Minister has availed of many photo opportunities in Shannon and has assured people that no harm will come to the airport while she holds office. Yet, her 17-page script does not contain any assurances for the people in Shannon. The only thing she said in relation to Shannon is that Aer Rianta will be instructed to provide an extension from three years to four years exemption from landing charges for new routes. That is not much comfort to people in Shannon, the mid-west, Kerry and up along the west coast. Indeed, from time to time, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might find it easier to use Shannon than Dublin, such is the traffic chaos in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just look at this Minister and what is happening on her watch. Aer Lingus and all the other air<Col N="765" /> lines are coming into Dublin bursting at the seams. Yet I am told that Dublin Airport has an operating loss this year, despite record numbers of people going through it. Is the Minister looking after the resource in which she has a 95% shareholding? What efforts have been made on behalf of those people who have given constant and loyal service to the national airline to see that they are properly looked after? The position is well illustrated by the promise which the Minister made in relation to looking after the pensions. Having sat on that for four and a half years, why did she make the promise at all? Why did she raise expectations about this among employees and former employees in Aer Lingus?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unbelievable. I made one suggestion about the Belfast routes. We must consider the effect of all these decisions on business people in the mid-west region, particularly senior employees with international companies. They cannot get to Dublin until evening time; there is no morning flight. They cannot travel onwards to Europe, which does not seem to be too badly affected by the aviation disaster. They just cannot connect. The situation is getting worse and worse.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has no interest in that. She is so busy trying to get industry into Dublin that she has forgotten there is such a place as Shannon and the Shannon region. The entire Government is indicted by this sloppy prevarication on this whole issue of Aer Lingus. It is not giving the right signal to people, especially to young people who want to stay in our area. Whenever there is a crisis in Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta, Shannon Airport is first to be kicked. The media are the best kickers of all. They say we are too biased, that we should not fight for our own workers in the Shannon region. The attitude seems to be that if the city is well catered for, everything is all right. That is not right. The quality of life in the regions is quite superior to that in Dublin. Further concentration there is simply compounding the problem.</P>
      <P>There is mention of a second or third terminal or a development at Baldonnel. We do not really know what the Government intends. This Government has lost the case. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, should take a long break and hand over to someone else.

      <P>Thank you very much. I know the Minister has had her own problems &ndash; per<Col N="766" /> sonal problems. Maybe they are affecting her. I believe she should get some assistance because, at the present time, I do not think the initiative is there.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister in expressing sympathy to the widow of Bernie Cahill, the former chairman. Mrs. Cahill is a Clare woman, from Ennistymon. I argued with the late Mr. Cahill about the future of Shannon Airport. He made promises which he did not fulfil in relation to Shannon Airport. I am sure God will reward him for the fine work he did but it was not all in Shannon's favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of certainties arising from the consequences of the terrorist attack in New York with world implications. One certainty arising from this disaster is that there is no leadership from Government in respect of the national airline, either for Dublin or Shannon, nor is there any leadership within Aer Lingus to enable a demoralised staff to understand what sort of future lies ahead. People have eulogised over Michael O'Leary in Ryanair. Within 48 hours of the US disaster, Ryanair had a plan on paper. They had a plan. Ryanair is not exposed on the north Atlantic. It is not a long haul service airline but rather a low cost no frills operator.</P>
      <P>This year, over a million American tourists came to Ireland and spent £556 million. They are our biggest tourism spenders. Most of Ireland's business and exports depend on airlines. One certainty arising from all of this is that, if leadership is not shown, Aer Lingus will be no more. I understand there are over 2,500 staff in headquarters in Dublin. The first decision to be made by Government is do we want a national airline? Does the Government want to save Aer Lingus and, if so, in what state? The European Commission has opened the door for assistance. Will that assistance be on the basis of subvention for the redundancy packages which must be made?</P>
      <P>Deputies from the mid-west are right to fight vehemently for their interests regionally and for the workers who live there. It should not be the pilots and cabin staff who are seen to be the most vulnerable. Aer Lingus has spent about £3 million on training 43 cadet pilots. A number of those are within two or three weeks of completing their training and they are being let go. Many of the more senior pilots, who have accumulated leave, are due for retirement next year. One such salary would equal that of three of the younger pilots. If the company gives away its newly trained young pilots, it gives away the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Government has to set out its long-term view of Aer Lingus. The chairman, from whom we have not heard a single sentence in respect of this, should set out his view and his plan for Aer Lingus. Staff are demoralised. Why has there been no approval from Government for the $198 return fare from the States? We see plans by Ryanair based on £9.99 to any city in Europe. Why has a decision not been taken by Aer Lingus to approve the low fare return rate <Col N="767" /> from the United States? Aer Lingus planes are going out with about 120 passengers instead of carrying 330. On a return flight, instead of carrying 660 passengers, there may be 200 or fewer. That may be due to paranoia or whatever, but there is no plan in place in Aer Lingus to deal with this. If there are to be redundancies, as there will be, then where and how they are implemented should be part of the plan. Aer Lingus itself is suffering from paralysis. There is no indication of an urgency or an outrage to fight back.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, recently waved a blank cheque at disadvantaged society in Ireland. The European Commission has opened the door for Government assistance in this matter. Before that assistance is paid out, Government should have a clear view of what it wants. Does it want Aer Lingus at all? Is it its view that it should continue in terminal decline as is now happening? The Fine Gael motion sets out the case for Government. The Minister for Public Enterprise should show some leadership in this and should be backed up by her Taoiseach and Aer Lingus should set out the details of its plan now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister painted a very bleak and serious picture of Aer Lingus. She did not sound very confident that Aer Lingus has a future. I would have expected something a little more positive from the Minister. It is obvious that she is under severe pressure and in a very difficult position. I will attribute her unfortunate opening remarks to the severe pressure she is under. She offered an abundance of doom and gloom and very little that was positive.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have no solution to offer in this crisis in Aer Lingus. She needs help badly. It is frightening that the Minister feels powerless in reaching a solution to what she describes as the crisis in Aer Lingus. I have no doubt her appeal for co-operation from the Opposition will be heeded because she desperately needs it. That is why Fine Gael put down this motion to facilitate an all-party debate in the Dáil on the airline industry and Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to hold out very little hope for the next meeting of EU Transport Ministers on 6 October. She seems to concede that even limited compensation is unlikely. This is a desperate attitude for the Minister to have. The Minister and her officials should approach this in the strongest and most positive manner possible given that the US Government has announced substantial aid to its airlines &ndash; some $5 billion in direct grants and a further $10 billion loan guarantees. I do not see why EU Ministers cannot allow EU national governments to give financial assistance to their airlines. EU countries have responded very positively to the US call for a united approach to deal with terrorism after the shocking events of 11 September. Why should <Col N="768" /> EU countries be debarred from grant aiding airlines, particularly in Ireland where the Government has a major shareholding in Aer Lingus?</P>
    <P>Ireland so desperately depends on tourism that it cannot afford a major collapse of Aer Lingus. Already the fall-out from the events in America is having a critical effect on tourism and hotels and related industries, particularly in the west. Last year in the September to December period more than 30,000 American visitors came to Ireland. This year that figure is reckoned to be down by 60% with a loss of £36 million in revenue. It is estimated that Galway city and county will lose £25 million during the September to December period. Approximately 25 hotels in Galway city and county would have a high dependence on American leisure and corporate business during the September to December period. The hotels surveyed said the American business for the month of September alone is down by between 28,000 and 80,000. Similar amounts are estimated for October.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus should adopt a positive marketing attitude and go out and sell the empty seats. Americans will search for a bargain in travel. I appeal to the management and those in marketing in Aer Lingus to go out and sell the empty seats and bring the visitors, American and European tourists, to Ireland to sustain the present and previous positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support speakers, especially on this side of the House, who mentioned the pensioners of Aer Lingus and the anxiety which they and their families are experiencing at present. I call on the Minister to make up her mind quickly and to bring their plight or anxiety to a conclusion and grant to them what they request. They have worked hard over the years and have given a life's service to this company. At a time when they should be enjoying life &ndash; during their pension years &ndash; they are not adequately provided for. The Minister should address this straight away.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that she will not sell off Aer Lingus. She is perfectly right in that because the middle of a downturn in the market is not the time to sell off Aer Lingus. There is a greater responsibility here than mere cash management and the creation of an open competitive market. We have got enormous return on the investments made in the carrier and its staff over the years. They have represented the interest of the State at times when our prosperity did not entice the entrepreneurs to fly their flag in cheap air travel. A time may well come again when we will wish to have a company of distinction to bring our national flag around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are an island nation which needs, more than other nations, ease of access to and from our land. Will companies which are now ready to scavenge the bodies of airline corporations be prepared to meet the need of the people when times are bad? I do not think so. Therefore, we must be sure that it is not just the euro value <Col N="769" /> which is considered but that when, or if, we dispose of our stake in Aer Lingus, we can be reasonably assured that the purchaser is committed to maintaining our routes and the levels of service which affect quality business traffic and tourists who are prepared to pay for added value not only for service on board an airline, but also when they arrive in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister must find ways to defer the sale of this national jewel until stability has returned to the industry throughout the world. The effect of the creation of a job at the airport was always viewed as generating up to five jobs in the wider local community. We cannot afford to lose one job there because to lose one is to lose six. North Dublin needs Aer Lingus to survive just as the nation needs the services of this great airline.</P>
    <P>The United States federal government has seen the need to change its investment policy arising from the events of 11 September. We need our Minister to press for a change in the European approach. Ministers must go out and convince their colleagues within the European Union of the mistakes in retaining the present position. In times of crisis new leadership is called for. The certainties of the past stand to be questioned. To conform may be to die while change gives the opportunity for fresh growth capable of taking the strain of an increased healthy crop. The message must be put with conviction that to be forced to sell the national airline is a very bad thing. It will have an negative effect in the immediate term and on the morale of the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party supports the motion from Fine Gael but our support is qualified as we believe an island nation needs to retain a State airline in public ownership. The background to this crisis is largely, but not solely, due the fall out from the terrorist attacks in the USA. Aer Lingus is the only Irish carrier on the North Atlantic routes. These routes provide the bulk of the airline's income. Ironically, my colleague, Deputy Sargent, who has a long track record supporting Aer Lingus is prevented from speaking here today due to his efforts to make the Government accountable for handing over Irish airports for foreign military use. If Irish airports, as a result of the Government's actions, become targets in a terrorist attack, then this debate will be seen as somewhat cosmetic and irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be foolish for the EU to refuse some type of compensation package for European airlines affected because to do nothing will ensure that American airlines will survive this period of crisis while their European counterparts will go out of business. This would be a disaster for any airline, but for Ireland, an island nation, losing Aer Lingus would represent the end of the most visible badge of Irish sovereignty to be seen around the world as well as landing a catastrophic blow to the employment prospects of so many people in north Dublin, Limerick and Cork. The aid package must also be accompanied by renewed interest from the State shareholder in <Col N="770" /> the airline, not a prelude to sell off or privatisation. It is our belief that the State, not a private venture capitalist, should benefit from this aid package in the long and short-term.</P>
    <P>We pledge our full support to the workers in this company. In light of his criticism of me, Deputy Daly is obviously afraid of losing his seat to the Greens. I also support the case for improved pension rights for former employees of Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>On 25 September I addressed a SIPTU seminar on the future of Aer Lingus. Some 200 union members, representing thousands of others who work for the airline, were present. All were deeply concerned about the future of Aer Lingus and the prospect of massive job losses. Estimates for employment cuts in the company have since greatly increased. A senior official of the Department of Public Enterprise informed the seminar that he was personally in favour of the privatisation of Aer Lingus. He is entitled to his opinion, but it is very revealing about the dominant thinking within the Department charged with responsibility for State owned companies. There is no passion there for making public ownership work. On the contrary, preparation for privatisation, as handed down by the Government, is the order of the day.</P>
      <P>In this international aviation crisis, the Government should make State aid available to the national airline without delay. The Government has allowed its hands to be tied by the EU and has meekly accepted the dictation that no State aid can be given. That was reiterated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, after the recent EU Finance Ministers' meeting and is restated in the Government amendment. Privatisation, either in the medium or long-term, would mean the break-up of the company, the loss of thousands of jobs and the destruction of a strategic pillar of the Irish economy. It must not be allowed to happen. We have seen how well the company fared in recent years and the benefits this had for the Irish economy. Tougher times are here, but they will not last forever. We need to look beyond the current crisis and go forward with a strategic review of the future.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Joe Higgins. The Government's amendment is a stay of execution for Aer Lingus. We need a strong commitment to Aer Lingus remaining and being developed in public ownership. The greatest asset of Aer Lingus is its skilled workforce. The members of that workforce must be central to decision making for the future. Their rights and interests must be safeguarded. Aer Lingus is our company and the Minister is charged with responsibility for it. It must remain our company.</P>

        <b>:</b> The 11 September atrocity in the United States where passenger airliners were cruelly commandeered to become guided missiles was inevitably going to lead to a <Col N="771" /> dramatic decrease in the number of people prepared to fly. This is a temporary effect, but major airlines have cynically used the atrocity to ruthlessly cut their workforces by tens of thousands. The indications are that there is to be a similar process in Aer Lingus. That must not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion calls for the possibility of State investment and I obviously support that. However, I draw attention to the amendment in my name with states that Aer Lingus should be developed &ldquo;without job losses&rdquo; and that Dáil Éireann &ldquo;further calls for maintaining the national airline in public ownership with the overhaul of inefficient management structures and bringing the Aer Lingus workforce into the heart of the airline's management&rdquo;. The board of Aer Lingus needs to be cleaned out of the assorted hacks who made their way onto its membership. These include people whose only qualification in aviation is to be hacks of one or other of the establishment political parties. How can they develop Aer Lingus as a viable entity?</P>
      <P>The management structures in the company need to be radically overhauled because they have proven grossly inefficient. Aer Lingus workers should be brought to the very heart of the management of the company because they know what needs to be done and have the commitment to do it. It would be a huge step forward if, instead of being treated like workers and enemies in a capitalist enterprise, they were treated as partners and the board and management structures made fully democratic.</P>
      <P>Former workers of Aer Lingus now depending on pensions must also have justice done to them and this new turn of events must not be used as an excuse to put their just cause on the long finger once again. The Minister and the Government have dragged their feet for long enough. The demands of those who made a major contribution to the airline, an important national asset, in the past must be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one of the points made by Deputy Higgins, namely, that the difficulties which beset companies in the aviation sector, particularly Aer Lingus, must not be used to advance particular agendas which people in management and elsewhere may have. This is a genuine crisis with which we must deal.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has a very skilled workforce and, as virtually every speaker indicated, the company is involved in a cyclical industry which can either encounter severe downturns &ndash; sometimes, as on this occasion, with little or no warning &ndash; or can slowly enter a trough. Just as surely as this crisis has happened, however, the airline industry will return to a state of vigour. The priority must be to ensure, in the first instance, that Aer Lingus, the national carrier, survives this crisis and, in the second, that the people who have given their time, energy and commitment to the airline over a long period are treated decently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> The first prerogative is that anybody who will be made redundant as a result of this crisis will have a proper pension fund put in place for them. That has not happened heretofore but it must happen now. We cannot countenance the excuse which, when I spoke last April, I predicted we might be given, namely, that things are difficult. I accept that things are difficult but it is the duty of the State to face up to its responsibility for the people who work and have worked for the airline and also for the people who will consider taking voluntary redundancy if the pension scheme is equitable and fair, as it ought to be. In my opinion, there are a great many members of staff who will be returning quite quickly to jobs in Aer Lingus. The temporary lay-offs that will be required must be structured in such a way so as to ensure that these people will be available to the airline as soon as there is an upturn and as soon as it is possible to re-employ them. Many of these individuals are extremely skilled and are committed to their work.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in her endeavours in Europe. I commend her for having already met her Belgian counterpart, which was an extremely important and constructive move on her part. There will be difficulties in obtaining European approval for cash injections. However, in view of the fact that the Americans have poured many billions of dollars into their industry, it should not be an impossible task. In the meantime there are many other initiatives which can be taken. Aer Rianta is in a position to use its marketing arm and should have a huge injection of cash pumped into it. The State could also have an input into other areas, such as security, which lead to airlines and Aer Rianta incurring enormous costs.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion when all possibilities and alternatives should be considered and taken on board. In that regard, I welcome the Minister's announcement of the reduced fare structure on transatlantic routes for people whose journeys originate on the other side of the ocean. In the circumstances, this development ought also to have been extended to Irish customers because it would help to increase passenger numbers and restore the confidence which was destroyed by the events of 11 September. We must face the fact that there were difficulties in the airline sector long before those events took place. The advent of 11 September precipitated the difficulties encountered by Swissair and other airlines, particularly in this instance, Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent constituencies in the mid-west have particular concerns. One of the points I wish to drive home strongly is that we will not stand for this difficulty for the airline being used as an excuse to wipe out Shannon.</P>

      <P>There are those in senior management positions in Aer Lingus who were previously accused of being most anxious to inflict pain on Shannon, if that was possible, and not <Col N="773" /> elsewhere. On this occasion, there are going to be difficulties all around. However, there is no way it will be acceptable to have additional difficulties inflicted on Shannon in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most important point we should remember is that this recession will end. When it does, Aer Lingus will need to be able to call on its skilled workforce as has been the case heretofore. We want to ensure that the members of that workforce are, in the meantme, treated decently and kept on standby in the best terms possible for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members for their contributions to the motion. Before dealing with specific issues raised in the debate I wish to express my horror at the tragic events that occurred on the United States on 11 September. Turning to the economic impact of the attacks, it is clear they will have an adverse financial impact on several sectors of the global economy, particularly the aviation sector.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed by Members about the very serious financial difficulties being experienced by Aer Lingus. While all of Aer Lingus's current difficulties do not stem from the tragic events of 11 September, those events seriously exacerbated a difficult trading environment for the airline. A number of internal and economic factors had already begun to impact on company profits prior to the tragic events in the US but those events turned a trading problem into a major crisis.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated that the board will urgently present proposals which will outline the full extent of the difficulties of the airline and the recommended solutions to address current difficulties. These proposals must form the basis for securing a viable airline operation. Many Members raised the question of State aid. The Minister clearly set out her thinking on this matter. At the risk of being repetitive, neither the European Commission nor the Government would support any return to a regime of State aid for airlines which are not viable. This is the position that has been adopted by all Governments since 1997. The Minister is fully <i>au fait</i> with the Commission's thinking on these issues arising from her recent contacts with the Commissioner for Energy and Transport &ndash; Madame de Palacio. These contacts are ongoing.</P>
      <P>If some limited form of compensation is provided, the Minister believes it would be supported on a non-discriminatory basis to viable airlines in line with appropriate guidelines which would have to be agreed at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House are concerned at the potential negative consequences for employment in Aer Lingus. The Minister will make every effort to secure a viable future for the airline so that it can play a significant role in aviation. However, let there be no doubt that this future can only be secured through a major restructuring of the airline. Uncertainty and vola<Col N="774" /> tility in the current business environment demands radical and rapid change in the airline. The current crisis demands significant changes by management and staff and sacrifices by staff. It will mean that staff will have to adapt and adjust themselves to changing market conditions. Change is painful, yet absolutely necessary to secure the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>As the Minister already stated, one of the key aims will be the protection of the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the airline. I reassure all the stakeholders that the Minister will work with all parties to achieve that objective. However, the time for tackling Aer Lingus's difficulties is limited because of the grave cash position of the airline. If decisive action is not taken quickly, it is inevitable that more unpalatable measures will be forced on the airline sooner rather than later. The current crisis in Aer Lingus is not a short-term problem and short-term solutions will not resolve the current difficulties of the airline.</P>
    <P>Securing the future of Aer Lingus is the Minister's aim and that of the Government. She will work ceaselessly with all the stakeholders to achieve that objective. Difficult times are ahead for the airline and staff but I have no doubt that with goodwill, flexibility and a commitment to succeed, Aer Lingus can have a viable future.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ring and Jim Higgins.</P>
      <P>We will live in exceptional times following the terrible events in the US and elsewhere. These events have led to major problems for Aer Lingus. Strong action is called for and the main reason we tabled the motion was to allow the House to support the Minister when she makes a case to the EU. I am disappointed the Government has seen fit to dilute the motion and is insistent on dividing the House. I call on the Minister of State to impress on his colleagues how positive it would be for the Government to support the motion. There is not much between us. We want the Minister to go to the EU to seek assistance for Aer Lingus so that the company can continue to trade. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the company. However, it is certain that if the company does not receive assistance and support it will cease to trade.</P>
      <P>I did not detect a fighting spirit in the Minister's contribution and the Minister of State's contribution was weak. I detect a code whereby the Government would possibly be satisfied if Aer Lingus closed. I am worried about that prospect. If the Minister wants the company to survive she should not divide the House. We should all support her in her battle in Europe and by dividing the House her position will not be as strong as it could be. The motion is positive and should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's amendment mentions a number of issues but it does not refer to action and what the Government will do. The Minister does not propose State aid for airlines. She said <Col N="775" /> it might help if someone else proposes such aid. That is a weak position. We need to strengthen the Minister's hand when she attends the EU because the consequences of Aer Lingus closing would be absolutely horrendous. Ireland is an island nation and we would be totally dependent on other carriers if Aer Lingus shut down.</P>
    <P>There already have been significant losses in the tourism sector which have compounded earlier losses following the foot and mouth disease crisis. I call on the Government to support the Opposition motion. Let us move forward with a united front. The US moved quickly to put a £5 billion package together. The EU most do likewise because the aviation industry cannot be allowed to collapse. I am afraid the Government has a hidden agenda and I fear it wants Aer Lingus to close. Unless action is taken, that will be the case. The Government has said if the industry is viable, aid might be provided but current figures demonstrate that the industry is not viable. It cannot become viable unless it receives aid. The hidden message emanating from the Government is that the company will not become viable and, therefore, it must shut down.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is a way of exacting some form of revenge on the company. The Minister has had a rough time over the past while dealing with Aer Lingus and perhaps it is a way for her to get her own back by closing the company and opening it again in a restructured form. That is not the way to go. Aer Lingus must be supported through State aid now. The Minister must seek such assistance from the EU and that call must be backed by the House later. By dividing the House, the Government is flying on one wing as it attempts to make a case to the EU and that is not good enough. Extended discount schemes, lower fares to the US and other measures have been taken but this should have happened some time ago. I hope it is not too late but the Government will stand indicted if Aer Lingus does not survive.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will be in the House for Question Time later. The tourism sector is in serious trouble but if Aer Lingus goes to the wall it will be wiped out.</P>

      <P>I call on the Government to do everything possible to help Aer Lingus to survive. The first step is to show a united front to the EU and the world this evening by not dividing on the motion. The Government wants to divide the House, not us. Government backbenchers have made similar contributions to ours and they should not troop in to support a division in the House later. A vital, national interest is at stake. Deputy Haughey said it would potentially be disastrous if the company closed and other Members have made similar comments. The Government <Col N="776" /> should not divide the House on this matter. We should go forward with a united front.</P>

      <P>This is the second time recently that Private Members' time has been used to discuss Aer Lingus. I wish to be associated with the condemnation of the tragedy that took place in America, but I am sad that the Government and the Minister are using it as an excuse in relation to Aer Lingus. We should call a spade a spade. The company has been in trouble for a long time, but the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the board of Aer Lingus have done nothing about it. They are using the events of a fortnight ago to deal with a serious problem that has been swept under the carpet for a long time.</P>
      <P>The workers are the people who will suffer. They had to strike on many occasions over the past two years because of their bad pay. I would welcome an investigation into Aer Lingus to find out where all the money went. I suspect we would discover that much of it was used by the board, its members and executives to pay for big dinners and trips abroad. I doubt there is an airport anywhere in the world that they did not visit, but the taxpayers picked up the tab.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers said, the Government must do something about this matter. The Minister will have to wake up because she has got away with many things in relation to public transport. She has washed her hands of every issue, including the traffic situation in Dublin and Aer Lingus, and tried to laugh them off. However, the laugh is over. This matter is serious for the workers, the country and the economy. The Government and the Minister must do something now about Aer Lingus and protect as many workers as possible. A plan must be put in place and funding must be provided. However, I hope it will not affect the funding of regional airports.</P>
      <P>I have been appalled over the years by the way Aer Lingus treated the regional airports. However, it may now have to consider using them. It will have to work to sell its flights, something to which it is not used. It will have to do what Ryanair did. I am not a fan of Ryanair but at least it operated as a private company in terms of getting out and selling its seats. Americans will travel an extra 100 or 200 miles if they can save a few dollars. Aer Lingus must get out there and try to sell its seats. It must also promote the regional airports. People would feel safer if they could depart from Knock and fly into destinations in America. People would also feel safer departing from Shannon. They no longer feel safe in cities and there is a major job to be done in relation to tourism in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation must wake up because this issue will have a huge effect on tourism interests throughout the State. Hotels have received many cancellations in the past few weeks and there will be knock-on effects. The Exchequer surplus has been affected already, which means the Government will not be in a position to buy the people <Col N="777" /> on 5 December. It will have to introduce a realistic budget. However, even if the recent events in America had not happened, we faced a serious situation with regard to Aer Lingus. Those events have just moved the problem to the fore and it must be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's speech. If I was a worker in Aer Lingus, I would not see much hope or understand what the Government intended to do for me. Something must be done. It would be an outrage if the national carrier ceased operations. Aer Lingus has always been a part of Ireland. It was marketed as symbolising the country, but it could close in the next few months because of a shortage of money. The American Government responded to the difficulties there. America constantly complains about subsidisation in Europe, but the minute one of its sectors got into difficulties, it did not mind going to the exchequer and helping the airlines.</P>
    <P>A similar situation has existed with regard to the agricultural sector for years. America put pressure on Europe to stop giving subsidies. However, when it found itself in a corner, it quickly put its hand into the kitty and looked after its own. I hope something can be done for Aer Lingus and that the Minister will respond.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am sorry I was not in a position to contribute earlier, given that I helped draft the motion, but I was detained in another forum. I thank all those who contributed to the debate. The fact that so many people on all sides considered it imperative to contribute to the discussion speaks for itself. However, the moment of truth will be in five minutes in terms of how people vote.</P>
      <P>As has been constantly repeated, Aer Lingus is not only an aviation company. It is the national carrier and for years it has carried the badge and emblem &ndash; the shamrock and the Tricolour &ndash; of Ireland around the world. The people have a special affinity and affection for Aer Lingus. It is one of the cornerstones of Ireland; it is part of what we are. It grew from a fledgling company into one with international status. It is synonymous with service, safety and success. The figures speak for themselves. It carries 6.5 million passengers each year and it made a £16 million group profit in 2000. Nevertheless, it has real difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International aviation, by its nature, is a cyclical business. The threat of war can have a drastic effect in terms of passenger numbers. The threat of recession has a similar effect. If there is a threat of currency fluctuations, Americans do not travel. Foot and mouth disease had a devastating effect on Aer Lingus figures from March, partly because of the mixed messages that were sent by <Col N="778" /> the Government and the failure to counteract the propaganda. There were misconceived ideas about what was happening in Ireland &ndash; one would imagine there was a human plague rather than an animal disease.</P>
    <P>The company has not helped itself in terms of industrial relations problems. Over the past year, the airline and the airport were closed down because of strikes by cabin crew, ground handling staff, clerical staff, catering staff and pilots. The twin towers tragedy on 11 September has caused a major problem for Aer Lingus. However, as other speakers noted, the problems were on the horizon for a long time but were not addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister and although she was long on verbiage, she was extremely sparse in terms of suggestions or solutions. In addition, the company since 11 September must be found guilty of failing to put in place a fight back strategy. The decision by the United States Government to salvage US airlines is extremely serious for Ireland. It is a change of policy on the part of the United States Federal Government that must be countered. If that does not happen, it will be disastrous for all EU airlines. We know what happened to Swissair and Sabena. Aer Lingus is already in a vulnerable state and it will be extremely serious for the airline. However, a chance exists. There is no excuse for the EU not ensuring that member states' governments are allowed to subsidise their own airlines. Who is calling the shots? Is the European Union a political federation or is it a bureaucracy? Ultimately, it is a federation of the member states and the politicians should call the shots. Meetings of the Council of Ministers must call the shots.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment contains very little reassurance. It is long on verbiage but short on specifics. On the basis of the contributions by the Minister and the Minister of State, there is a sense of grim foreboding and helplessness. They are throwing up their hands and saying they cannot do anything. My colleagues are correct in believing that a decision has been made to allow Aer Lingus to go to the wall. I agree it must be restructured, but that must be done in a sensitive and ordered way. It must be viable and return to profit. That will happen if it is restructured and given time and capital.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus must be retained in State ownership for at least three to four years. The company must not be allowed to go under. The people are watching, waiting and listening and woe betide any Government or political party that allows Aer Lingus to go to the wall. It cannot happen.</P>

    <Title>Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At present, the Ordnance Survey, or OSI, is a Civil Service office under the aegis of the Minister for Finance. The primary purpose of this Bill is to set up the OSI as a State body outside the Civil Service. This will enable the OSI to have the freedom to operate with a more commercial focus, subject to appropriate controls. The main role of the OSI will continue to be that of operating in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive mapping and geographic records of the State. Accordingly, a key provision in the Bill is that the OSI will be required to provide for the State specific services to high standards of quality in return for a subvention from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the Ordnance Survey has a long and illustrious history of providing a mapping service to the State. The Ordnance Survey or, as it is more colloquially known, &ldquo;The Survey&rdquo; was established in 1824 as a centralised agency to provide mapping for the State. No organisation is static and the role of the Ordnance Survey has changed greatly since its foundation. From the early 20th century its role in support of Government services developed still further as mapping became an increasingly important prerequisite for land valuation, land registration and asset recording for local authorities and utilities. Today the products and services offered by the Ordnance Survey extend to the commercial sector and the unprecedented prosperity achieved under this Administration's stewardship of the economy has also been accompanied by a large increase in commercial demand for the products and services produced by the OSI.</P>
    <P>The way the OSI operates has changed dramatically in the most recent decades; within the past 20 years map-making has been transformed from a hand-written activity to a digital process which employs the most advanced information technology. As a result, all maps in the Ordnance Survey are now stored digitally rather than in paper form. This means, for example, that customers who call to OSI headquarters or OSI agents can get within minutes a specially printed map for anywhere in Ireland which meets their requirements.</P>
    <P>The advent of cheaper and more efficient technology has also led to the emergence of geographic information systems or GIS. In plain terms, GIS combines map data with computer software to produce a powerful tool for analysing information or for providing services more efficiently. GIS is now an important part of the information society and there are hundreds of <Col N="784" /> companies throughout the world producing thousands of GIS products.</P>
    <P>Among the myriad ways in which GIS can be used by the commercial sector is to link customer data with map data to identify new business opportunities and to plan delivery routes more efficiently. In the public sector, examples of the application of GIS are to pinpoint the incidence of various diseases and the efficient planning of waste collection. These new applications have considerably broadened the customer base for mapping data and the prospects are that the demand for new and improved products and services derived from these data will continue to grow strongly for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>It is against this changing background that the Government came to the conclusion that the restrictions imposed by its Civil Service status limit the OSI's capacity to meet its customers' demands and to exploit new opportunities in the marketplace. Hence the necessity to bring forward this Bill to transform Ordnance Survey Ireland into a separate State body with a strong commercial remit.</P>
    <P>This conclusion has been validated by the findings of the interim board of the OSI. In June 1997, the outgoing Government agreed to a proposal by the Minister for Finance to establish an interim board to advise the Minister for Finance on, and oversee, the transition of OSI to a more commercial organisation. In April 1998, the interim board set out in a report its vision for the future of OSI. It suggested that OSI has considerable scope to develop the market for its products and to reduce the size of the State subvention. The interim board concluded that the fundamental organisational change needed for OSI to fulfil adequately its public service responsibilities and to anticipate wider customer demands in the future would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The interim board reflects a wide range of users of OSI products and of other interest groups, including employer and employee groups. It is headed by Mr. Kevin Bonner, former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The other members are representatives of the wholesale book sellers trade, the Irish Mountaineering Council, chartered surveyors, local authorities, IBEC and ICTU. I take the opportunity in this House to compliment the chairperson, Mr. Bonner, and the other members of the interim board on the excellent work they have done to date.</P>
    <P>A further reason for this Bill is to rectify the existing unsatisfactory situation where, despite its 177 year existence, there is no primary legislation governing the OSI. All previous legislation, particularly the 19th century statutes, refer specifically to boundary survey work which is more relevant to the chief boundary surveyor who is, and who will remain, attached to the Val<Col N="785" /> uation Office. This Bill will rectify this situation and allow OSI to carry out its functions based on a sound legislative framework.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my speech I referred to the role of the new body. I want to deal with this subject in more detail because it is important to emphasise that, despite the change envisaged in its status under this Bill, OSI will continue &ndash; as it has done so effectively for the past 177 years &ndash; to fulfil its traditional role of providing mapping services for the administrative, legislative, infrastructural and other needs of the State. At present, this role falls into four main operational categories &ndash; the updating and maintenance of the framework on which national mapping is based and on which very many industries such as construction, surveying, transport and air navigation depend; a programme to complete a new mapping infrastructure for rural Ireland in the short-term; an ongoing maintenance and development programme to ensure that urban, rural and tourist and leisure mapping databases are up to date and a developing marketing and sales function to ensure that products and services are suitably developed to meet the ongoing and anticipated needs of public and private customers.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the general function of OSI will continue to be to provide the national mapping service in the State and that it will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive maps and geographical information of the State. The Bill sets out, for the first time, a detailed listing of the tasks that are necessary for OSI to fulfil its public interest role. Accordingly, for example, OSI will be required to continue to map all areas of the country, including those which do not provide a commercial return on this activity.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the more commercial focus for OSI provided for in the Bill, OSI will continue to need a substantial subvention from the Exchequer in order to enable it to carry out all its tasks in fulfilling its general functions and provide a quality service to the State. On this issue, the interim board examined what the financial position of OSI would be if it were to become a stand alone commercial body. The conclusion of the examination was that, on the basis of the revenues then being generated, OSI costs would be such as to leave an annual deficit for the foreseeable future of considerably more than half of its revenues.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Bill is that the amount and the terms and conditions attaching to the advance of funds from the Exchequer will be set out in a service agreement between OSI and the Minister for Finance. The service agreement will set out in detail the range of activities OSI will carry out in the public interest and will, among other things, contain a description of each such activity, the justification for and benefits arising from the activity, details <Col N="786" /> of the deliverables to be provided by OSI &ndash; including details of the standard and quality required, and the amount of the funding to be allocated to each of the individual activities. An important benefit of the service agreement is that, in clearly identifying the public interest element in mapping, it will also help ensure that there is no cross subsidisation from the public purse of any of OSI's commercial activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the service agreement between the Minister for Finance and OSI may contain terms and conditions in relation to the pricing of products. It is envisaged that OSI's pricing policy will adhere to the principle of ensuring that the optimum use is made of their products and services by all sectors of Irish society, both public and private.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that OSI, when engaging in commercial activity, may do so through subsidiary companies with limited liability set up under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999. Any capital necessary for such companies will not come from the public purse. Instead, it will be raised in the marketplace on the basis of the commercial merits of the project concerned. In short, there will be no cross subsidisation of commercial activity from the Exchequer, in respect of either capital or running costs.</P>
    <P>Measures to ensure that there is no cross subsidisation by the Exchequer of potential commercial activity by OSI are an important feature of the Bill. These include clear statements of the OSI's public interest functions, the requirement for a service agreement with the Minister for Finance to deliver specified public interest outputs in return for Exchequer money and provisions to establish separate limited companies which will operate on a purely commercial basis for any commercial activity. In addition, OSI will operate transparent accounting practices to identify commercial activities and separate them from non-commercial activities and will also implement a fair and transparent pricing policy which will ensure that OSI's basic data are available to competitors in the marketplace on the same terms and conditions as to its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I will now speak about the considerable investment that has already been made by OSI to prepare itself for its future as a more commercially focused entity outside the Civil Service. I have already referred to OSI's use of leading edge technology. This has been made possible by the substantial sums which have been allocated to OSI in recent years to ensure that it uses the most up to date techniques in map production. For example, OSI is leading the way in the use of satellite positioning and is currently in the process of implementing a network of permanently operating global positioning system receivers for the country. This system is expected to be operational by early next year and will be controlled from a central computer in OSI headquarters. <Col N="787" /> Similarly, OSI has a very advanced in-house geographic information system that is used, not only to store all collected digital mapping data but also for the supply, editing and management of data. It is anticipated that supplying GIS users with digital mapping products will be a major area of business growth.</P>
    <P>While OSI has invested considerable resources in technology, it has not neglected also to invest in its major resource, its staff. The training of staff in the new technology has been under way for many years. On the management front, the Minister for Finance has sanctioned a number of new managerial posts in anticipation of the move from the Civil Service. These include appointing heads of human resources, corporate services, marketing and IT.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the staffing arrangements for the new body given that it will be operating outside the Civil Service. It is envisaged that all staff currently employed by the Ordnance Survey will transfer to the new body on establishment day. There are standard but important provisions in the Bill which guarantee that the tenure, pay scales and other terms and conditions of employment, including superannuation benefits, of the OSI staff will continue to apply to them in the new body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In the year 2000, there were 6.3 million overseas visitors to Ireland who contributed an estimated £2.2 billion, 2.80 billion, in foreign revenue earnings, excluding Irish carrier receipts which amounted to £0.6 billion, 0.75 billion. There were 1.1 million visitors from north America who contributed almost £560 million, 710 million, or 25% of foreign revenue earnings.</P>
      <P>No official estimates are as yet available in relation to the loss of tourism business from the United States and elsewhere arising from the tragic events of 11 September 2001. However, although it is accepted that it is still too early to assess the overall impact on international travel patterns, it is clear that the terrorist attacks in the US are likely to impact significantly on visitor numbers to Ireland, in particular from America, for the balance of this year and into 2002, leading to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for a decade.</P>
      <P>The latest official CSO tourism and travel statistics, published on Friday, 28 September, indicate that earnings from overseas visitors to Ireland during the first half of 2001 showed an increase of 3.8% to £1.3 billion on the same period last year. Overall visitor numbers for the first half of 2001 were down 5.2% to 2.7 million on the same period last year, with the slowdown being most acute in the case of Great Britain and north America. Bord Fáilte now estimates that total overseas visitor numbers for 2001 are likely to show a further reduction on that figure following the terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte's original estimate for 2001 was for an increase of 5% in overall visitor numbers, although that estimate had been revised significantly downwards in the light of the anticipated adverse impact of the foot and mouth disease emergency earlier this year. Ironically, Irish tourism was beginning to show signs of recovery from this setback, mainly due to the early lifting of the major FMD restrictions in line with expert technical advice and subsequently, due to the beneficial impact of a targeted £10 million, 12.7 million international and domestic tourism marketing reassurance campaign by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the tragic events of 11 September, both myself and officials of my Department have met senior management of both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Ltd., the new all island tourism marketing company, and with a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, to take stock of the situation and to put in place arrangements to ensure that marketing strategies will be developed to deal with the fall-out from the recent atrocity for the remainder of this year's season and for 2002. Critical factors will include not only the nature and duration of the response to the terrorists' attacks, but also the <Col N="789" /> speed with which public confidence in air travel can be restored.</P>
    <P>Given the changed environment, it is vitally important that there is a root and branch reassessment of our tourism marketing strategies, including how and where we focus our business, so that the substantial Exchequer funding already allocated for this area under the national development plan has maximum impact. The Exchequer budget for tourism this year will be close to £90 million, 114 million, the lion's share of which is allocated for tourism marketing activities.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Ltd. confirmed that they were urgently re-examining, in consultation with the tourism industry and through the tourism marketing partnership structure, their respective marketing programmes and plans for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002. Bord Fáilte announced late last week a £750,000, 950,000, programme of additional immediate measures for the British and Irish markets. Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Ltd. is already spearheading the review of marketing plans for 2002 with the intention of making a major announcement early next month in conjunction with the launch of a new advertising campaign for the island of Ireland. These moves have been welcomed by ITIC and I am grateful for their measured response to date to the current situation.</P>
    <P>The Government is also very conscious of the important link between competitive air access and future tourism flows and has been working closely with the Irish aviation sector to help resolve recent difficulties and to help preserve the greatest number of international gateways.</P>
    <P>Given the changed circumstances, I also believe it is vitally important to quickly bed down the process of institutional change now under way in the tourism State agencies which have remained unchanged in structure since the early 1960s. It will be critical to complete an orderly hand over of responsibility to Tourism Ireland Ltd. in time for the 2002 marketing season.</P>
    <P>My Department has been keeping in close consultation with the Department of Public Enterprise in recent days and I particularly welcome today's announcement by Aer Rianta to extend its discount scheme for new routes to Dublin Airport. Under this scheme there will be no charges for new routes for three years. I also welcome the very attractive discount return fare of $198 introduced by Aer Lingus for its services from New York and Boston to Ireland up to mid-December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, announced in the Dáil today that Aer Lingus's bookings since 11 September are down 80% on last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> What does the Minister mean when he speaks about refocusing business? Has the Government decided no longer to concentrate on the United States market? What plans are there to intensify marketing in the United States and what arrangements are being put in place for these plans?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that Aer Lingus had a problem long before 11 September and major restructuring had been planned within the company. The foot and mouth disease problem also affected the airline.</P>
      <P>The position of Aer Lingus must be reassessed. The airline has been reassessing its position as have many European airlines. We are refocusing but we have no intention of pulling out of the United States.</P>
      <P>If one can use the word &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo; with regard to such a dreadful atrocity, it was fortunate that it occurred at this time of year. The destination marketing budget was spent in the early part of the year. The money which will be spent by Bord Fáilte in the United States will be spent on promotion of niche areas. We will continue to do that type of marketing.</P>
      <P>This morning Deputy Noonan referred to Tourism Ireland Ltd., TIL, and said the company had been set up without employees. TIL was set up with a view to the 2002 marketing campaign. It has a chairman, a chief executive and a board which has met on a number of occasions and has been working hard for the past year. There has been no hiatus in the setting up of TIL. I am waiting for the transfer of the employees from Bord Fáilte to the new company. The same people are carrying on the same work as we speak. Tomorrow, I have a meeting with trade unions and I will encourage them to do everything possible to ensure there is a smooth transfer of 103 staff to the new company. They have a part to play in this national challenge. There have been a few problems, but they have been ironed out. I am confident about my meeting tomorrow as trade unions have been helpful during past national challenges. This involves a loss of jobs in Aer Lingus and in the tourism industry. It is not that TIL has been set up without employees as there will be a changeover of staff to the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, has asked me to apologise on her behalf as she cannot attend today. In the circumstances, I am confident the Minister will understand. In the situation faced by Irish tourism at the moment, it is a shame that we lost the 2004 world cycling championships which was to be held in Killarney, because £2.7 million sought by the organisers was not provided by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The event would have brought £25 million into County Kerry, especially around Killarney, a town which has suf<Col N="791" /> fered from foot and mouth disease and from the terrible recent atrocities in the United States.</P>
      <P>Killarney also suffered last year from a train strike which happened during high season. Does the Minister not agree that it is unacceptable to allow such an event to slip though our fingers?</P>
      <P>Given that tourists are less inclined to fly at the moment and that airlines throughout the world are decreasing their levels of activity, what special emphasis is being placed on alternative methods of access into Ireland, such as by sea? An alternative to enable the arrival of significant numbers of people, who may not otherwise come here, is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphatically reject the idea that the world cycling championships would have brought £25 million to County Kerry. I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to explain, given that people have called for my resignation. Initially, my Department offered £750,000 for the world cycling championships, a bid that was increased to £1 million. I had reservations in the first instance with the sport of cycling, given its attitude to doping. The fact that foot and mouth disease had damaged tourism and that Killarney is the capital and heart of tourism meant that I was willing to bid for the event and give cycling a chance.</P>
      <P>We offered £1 million to the UCI to be allowed run the championships, but that organisation looked for £2.7 million. Deputy Allen brought the Tour de France here in 1998 for £2 million. My Department spends more than £1 million to sponsor five golf competitions each year, which provide 20 days of television coverage. The Ryder Cup, which will be the world's greatest sporting event in 2006, cost £3.7 million. Television coverage for the Ryder Cup will last six days. I offered £1 million to the UCI for the world cycling championships, but it did not represent value for money, basically. I felt there were many other things that could be done with £1 million and that expenditure of £2.7 million would not be prudent, especially in comparison to the Tour de France and the Ryder Cup. We sponsor five major golf tournaments each year, which cost a total of £1 million and which bring 20 days of television coverage. The world cycling championships would have brought two days coverage at the most. My Department's offer of £1 million was generous and I am surprised that the UCI did not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also asked about access. The Government has always been interested in enhancing access into Ireland on the sea and in the air. I was delighted my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, brought forward proposals today to encourage air access and I hope that we will bring forward more proposals. A Government sub-committee, consisting of the Taoiseach, <Col N="792" /> the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Enterprise and I has been set up to deal with the specific economic problems that may impact on tourism. I hope further proposals and incentives will be produced to improve air and sea access. A number of proposals from each of the Departments involved are well worth looking at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree he should have brought forward proposals long before now? His delay begs the question of why we must wait for a crisis to bring forward such proposals. When the Minister says we must refocus, does he mean he will not allocate any more money for marketing? Is the Minister in a position to say whether more funds can be set aside for marketing? Does he plan to move the money available to focus on different areas? Have any tourism agencies or bodies requested extra funds for marketing? If so, how much has been requested and who requested it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a request from ITIC, the tourism confederation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Irish Hotels Federation made a request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any other requests been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation represents the entire tourism industry. Nobody has requested funding except people on television who recommended that we throw £5 million at the problem, to be dumped in the United States. A sum of £40 million is being lost each day by television networks in the United States as corporations there do not want to advertise at this time. Americans are not listening and are not travelling; as we all understand, they have much more on their minds. There has not been a major cry for money to be thrown into the American market.</P>
      <P>In fairness to TIL and to Bord Fáilte, I was to launch a marketing campaign for 2002 on behalf of TIL in Dublin and Belfast during the first two weeks of November. The launch is to go ahead in the first week of November. Following the events of 11 September, groups have refocused to argue that marketing should be aimed at Europe and the United Kingdom. There has been a reassessment of the strategy that had been planned. The launch will go ahead in November following a reassessment. It is likely that greater emphasis will be placed on Europe in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not intend to abandon the US market, but we will concentrate on niche areas like incentives, conferences and golf. The American Express international golf tournament was to be <Col N="793" /> held in the United States in September, but was cancelled following the tragedy. American Express donated the $5 million prize to the disaster fund. Thanks to Bord Fáilte, the competition will be held here next year, which means that Tiger Woods, Darren Clarke and Padraig</P>
    <P>Harrington will compete here. The Seve Ballesteros tournament will also be held here, so it can be seen that many major events are planned. The marketing campaign will continue. We are not abandoning the United States. I wish to make one other response to Deputy Stanton's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, as we have to move on to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Two major events have affected the United States in the past 15 years, the Lockerbie disaster and the Gulf War. There was a 20% drop in tourist numbers from the United States following Lockerbie and it took two years to overcome the crisis. Similarly, it took two years to recover from the Gulf War. I hope that the two-year period can be minimised as a result of the ideas we have in place within the United States, the marketing that has been done before now and the establishment of TIL. I certainly hope we can minimise the percentage loss in the United States. With the marketing we have carried out up to now I hope we can minimise that period and the percentage loss.</P>

      <P>Following a Government decision on 1 May 2001, independent consultants, High-Point Rendel, were engaged to undertake an overview of the cost of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project. The steering group of senior officials overseeing the work expect to have their final meeting with the consultants within the next seven days, after which the consultants' report will be submitted to the Government for its consideration and decision. It is envisaged that the report will be submitted to the Government during October.</P>
      <P>Until the steering group has submitted this independent report to me and I have submitted it to the Government for its consideration I do not intend to make any statement on its contents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the consultants have already passed on the report to the steering committee and that the committee has sought clarification.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that I keep a hands-off approach to this. The consultants have reported to the steering committee. If I were to interfere now the Deputy would say I had in some way altered the report to my benefit. I have not been involved with it, as it is an independent report and as soon as that report comes to me during the steering committee I will bring it to Government, where it will discussed. Only then will we be able to make a decision on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A report in one of the Sunday newspapers last week stated that the costs are now considerably more than the original estimate of £550 million for both the stadium and the campus. Can the Minister give us an indication as to whether costs have escalated to that extent? Will the Government still go ahead with this project? Will money be provided in this year's Estimates for the project in the event of a considerably higher estimate than was envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two conflicting reports in the newspapers, one of which stated that the cost was very close while the other stated the stadium cost had overrun. When I get the report I will bring it to Government and it will be a decision for Government as to whether to publish it.</P>
      <P>Neither newspaper carried any of the benefits and I have always argued that there are great benefits to accrue from a stadium like this. I have always maintained that the stadium represents money to be spent over a period of six to seven years and that there was money for it in the Exchequer &ndash; no other sector such as health, education and environmental projects would be at a loss or suffer as a result of the stadium. I have always maintained nothing else should suffer as a result and that is the way we were proceeding as there was money to do all that at that time. I accept that circumstances have changed but at the same time I am committed to the idea of the stadium. There is a great deal of planning and architectural work to be done yet and we will do it. Circumstances have changed in recent months. We are still committed to the stadium but we have also been a competent Government over the past four years and we will prioritise as we have done in the past.</P>

      <P>There is also a report that some of the main bidders have now pulled out because of the uncertainty. Can the Minister confirm the number of bidders still under consideration and <Col N="795" /> whether some have already pulled out at this stage?</P>
      <P>Approximately £150 million was committed to the FAI and £80 million to the GAA to get their support for the project. Has that money been paid to those organisations? If not, when will it be paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally there were six bidders and I have had no indication that anyone has pulled out; that is to the best of my knowledge as I have not involved myself since we left this to the independent consultants. However nobody has said that anyone has pulled out of this.</P>
      <P>Regarding the GAA and FAI, the money for the Special Olympics, which was £15 million, has been paid over to the GAA and negotiations with the GAA are ongoing. My officials had meetings with the FAI yesterday, during which its situation was discussed, and I understand there was a satisfactory outcome to that meeting as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 was launched on 10 May last. It is the result of a year-long review of the existing strategy and involved the largest ever public consultation on drugs policy held in Ireland. The new strategy is the first time all elements of drugs policy been brought together in a single framework. In addition, it clearly assigns responsibility to the different Departments and agencies involved in drugs policy under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Under the strategy, a series of 100 actions have been developed which are designed to drive the strategy forward.</P>
      <P>A central part of the strategy is the development of an effective regional framework to implement the policy through the establishment of regional drugs task forces, RDTFs. The new task forces will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors and will be responsible for putting in place a strategy to tackle drug misuse specifically for this region. They will incorporate and expand the work of the current regional drug co-ordinating committees and the secretariat to the RDTFs will be provided by the relevant health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the setting up of regional drugs task forces, a series of ten regional seminars have been held by my Department and the national drug strategy team to provide information on the strategy and to lay the foundations for the setting up <Col N="796" /> of the regional drugs task forces. It is anticipated that the regional drugs task forces will be established by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>Research shows that the main illicit drugs used outside Dublin are cannabis and ecstasy and that heroin use is still overwhelmingly a Dublin problem. The most recently available figures from the Central Treatment List show that 97% of those on methadone treatment reside in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region and that 96% of the arrests for heroin possession take place in Dublin. That said, we are increasingly aware, through informal contacts with the Garda and health boards, that pockets of heroin misuse are developing in a number of towns throughout the country. I am most concerned about these developments and I expect that the RDTFs will play an important role in identifying any increasing incidences in the misuse of heroin and other drugs outside of Dublin as well as developing proposals in their action plans to address gaps in services in their areas. In this way, the RDTFs will ensure that the National Drugs Strategy will have a significant impact in their regions. Measurement and evaluation are important parts of this strategy. This will be achieved in a number of ways. First, I am chairing the interdepartmental group on drugs, which meets monthly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set out in the strategy. Any obstacle to the implementation of any of the actions can be brought to the attention of the IDG at these meetings. In addition, a progress report on the implementation of the strategy will be presented every six months to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, which is chaired by the Taoiseach. The first progress report is due in December next.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, all Departments and agencies involved in the strategy have to prepare a critical implementation path. This will set out the steps they will take to ensure that the actions set for them in the strategy are implemented. These plans are due by the end of the year. A report on progress made in implementing the various actions will be published annually and the Deputy should also note that an independent evaluation of the strategy will be carried out in 2004.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his quite comprehensive response, as this is a very wide area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to drugs seizures, there has been a significant increase in the amount and number of seizures this year. Does the Minister of State believe that is because the Garda and the drugs task forces within the Garda have become more efficient or is it because there are simply more drugs on the market? There does not seem to have been a cor<Col N="797" /> responding impact on price or supply of drugs outside the capital.</P>
    <P>The drugs strategy review clearly states that by the end of 2001, the local drug task force areas will receive an increased level of Garda resources. Has this happened? Is the Minister concerned that if resources are only increased in local drug task force areas, they will effectively only be increased in Dublin and the north side of Cork? What is his view on the need to increase resources in Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda etc. in which there is clear evidence of significant drug problems? Has there been an increase in manpower or resource levels in the Customs and Excise drug area since the Government took office?</P>
    <P>On the issue of prevention, will the Minister acknowledge that different approaches are required to solve the recreational and hard drug problems in the capital, the latter being primarily cocaine and heroin, and does his Department adopt such approaches at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues which arose during the public consultation process was the need to increase Garda presence in the local drug task force areas. The first IDG meeting was held earlier this year at which representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were in attendance. They are currently devising the implementation of the aspects of the strategy to which the Department agreed. When regional task forces are set up to cover areas such as those outlined by the Deputy, which I agree are at risk, they will probably seek increased Garda resources in those areas. The strategy proposes greater co-ordination between the Garda and the Customs and Excise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 6, 51 and 178, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The latest survey by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign was carried out in May 2001. The hotel and restaurant sectors were among those covered by its scope. The survey found that 64% of firms surveyed have prepared or are in the process of preparing a plan to manage the changeover to the euro. Some 78% have received information on what is involved in the changeover and 79% have someone with specific responsibility for managing the changeover.</P>
      <P>To address the issue in the tourism industry, CERT has designed and is delivering a series of workshops at regional locations to help tourism operators identify key issues and to develop phased action plans aimed at addressing these. In the period January to June of this year, CERT ran a total of 18 workshops attended by 280 managers from the industry. These workshops were held in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Sligo, Galway, Castlebar, Killarney and Clonmel. They are being run for the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Licensed Vintners Federation. A further series of eight workshops will be delivered over the July to December period and it is estimated that 200 industry personnel will attend these.</P>
      <P>Apart from its own preparations for the introduction of the euro, which included the commencement of staff training in April 2001 and dual currency display in all print material for 2001, Bord Fáilte has used the opportunity of its regional roadshows to heighten awareness in the industry of the implications of the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry is also playing its part. In September 2000, the Irish Hotels Federation, in conjunction with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, recommended to all members that they should subscribe to the IBEC-EAN Ireland code of practice regarding the changeover. This code, which has been approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs, will provide a framework for self-regulation by the industry with regard to pricing, currency display and conversion and consumer information. In May and June of this year, the Irish Hotels Federation conducted a series of regional <Col N="799" /> seminars to highlight to its members the issues involved in the changeover. This was followed in September with a series of follow-up seminars to provide more specific guidance and encouragement. The changeover is also the subject of updates in the federation's newsletter as well as of specific mailings to the membership.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department, particularly Bord Fáilte, and the professional associations within the tourism industry are making careful preparations for the introduction of the euro and that they, in co-operation with other organisations such as the Euro Changeover Board, Forfás and the IBEC, are doing all possible to exhort and prepare the industry for changeover. It is now up to each individual business to work to ensure it is ready in good time for the changeover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of our earlier discussions and the financial pressures under which the industry labours, has the Minister considered providing financial assistance to the players in the industry who must bear the costs of the changeover? What would be the typical cost of the changeover for a small business in the tourism sector? Is the Minister aware of insurance-related problems in regard to the need for businesses to maintain large amounts of cash on their premises during the changeover period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to provide incentives, cash or otherwise, to businesses during the changeover period. The changeover is part of the open market and businesses have had sufficient time to prepare themselves. Governments should not be expected to lend a crutch to all manner of changeovers.</P>
      <P>I do not know what costs will accrue to small businesses as a result of the changeover &ndash; this matter is probably more relevant to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. On the issue of insurance, I do not know what action could be taken in this area. We underwent a successful changeover in 1973 and, given our levels of technology and the calibre of our young men and women, I feel confident we will adapt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the confusion which will arise as a result of the existence of different currencies on both sides of the Border, namely, sterling and the euro? Some enterprises span both sides of the Border. For example, people using the Ballyconnell canal may have to use both currencies. Has the Minister established a sub-committee to consider the problem and propose possible solutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The changeover is a matter for the Department of Finance which has publicised the matter through advertising campaigns etc. My Department is attempting to prepare the tourism <Col N="800" /> industry and small businesses through a series of roadshows as outlined earlier. Some 64% of the firms surveyed have prepared a changeover plan or are in the process of doing so. Some 79% have a specific person to manage the changeover. Those figures are very encouraging. I accept that problems will arise along the Border in regard to sterling and it will take time to deal with these. We can only envisage that there will be teething problems, as there are in any changeover. I am quite sure we can adapt to the changes. However, the overall euro changeover is a matter for the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 52 on 31 May 2001, Bord Fáilte confirmed that, as no major construction work had taken place on site by January 2001, the grant contract with the developers of the proposed national conference centre at Spencer Dock formally terminated in March 2001. I also explained that I had asked Bord Fáilte to commission new research on the international conference market and the optimum positioning of Ireland within that market in order to enable me to return to Government on the issue. It should be borne in mind that the research on which the concept of a national conference centre was based was almost ten years old.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the consultants have now presented their report entitled, Maximising Ireland's Potential in the International Conference Market, to Bord Fáilte. My Department is awaiting Bord Fáilte's response to the report and its recommendations before completing its examination of the report and when this process is complete I will be reporting to Government on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When answering this question last May the Minister indicated that the report would be with Bórd Fáilte within one month. Did it actually arrive within the month? Would it be correct to assume from the Minister's reply today that it is highly unlikely that any proposal in relation to the proposed national conference centre will go to Government within the lifetime of the Government? Thank God, we are coming close to the end of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We have quite some time to go yet. This has been a competent Government during the past four years and I am quite sure that, in times of turbulence, people will return to the <Col N="801" /> many positive effects the Government has had during that period.</P>
      <P>Yes, I did receive the report from Bórd Fáilte within the specified period. As I said, the research of the information available in this regard was about ten years old. I will have the report to Government within two or three weeks. We are still committed to a national conference centre. This is the only capital city in Europe that does not have such a centre. The report is very much geared towards conference marketing, on which we have been losing out. We have a site and planning permission for the national conference centre. It may well come to the stage where the Government will have to go ahead and build such a centre. The state aid situation has changed. Only 18% state aid is now available in the Dublin area. Therefore, it may take a Government decision to build it. The report will be before Government within the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Government's decentralisation policy, would it not be wise to look at another location for the national conference centre? I am sure the Minister is aware that the National Events Centre in Killarney can hold over 3,000 people. The Government should consider designating it as the national conference centre and provide extra money to upgrade its facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be interested to hear the answer to the question about location. In view of what the Minister said, I still think he is pushing the decision away into the future. If there is a big change of policy, in terms of the State financing the national conference centre in full, is it likely that he will go forward with such a recommendation within the next two to three weeks, as he indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to location, we are involved in research which will determine where we place the national conference centre. I understand when this matter came up during the term of the previous Government it was also designated for Dublin. National conference centres are normally located in the country's capital city. That does not mean that we have do likewise, but access is an important factor. I know there is a facility in Killarney to transform existing conference areas into a national conference centre and accommodation would be available, but I wonder about access. I am not sure if that aspect is dealt with in the report.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Deputy will appreciate the difference between it and an airport catering for 17 million people, as is currently the case at Dublin Airport. The location will be a matter <Col N="802" /> for decision by Government. As I said, it is my personal opinion that, if we are to have a national conference centre, it may take a Government decision to go ahead and build it, because I do not think the incentive is there, with the current&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dismayed and angered by the announcement yesterday by the UK Government to give the go-ahead to the mixed oxide, MOX, fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield. The Irish Government has strongly and consistently opposed the commissioning of the MOX plant and its concerns about, and opposition to, this plant have been conveyed to the UK authorities in every possible manner. Notably, we have responded in a detailed manner to five separate rounds of public consultation on the proposed commissioning during the period 1997 to 2001. I have also at every possible opportunity expressed the Government's opposition to this plant in correspondence and at meetings with UK Ministers. Our concerns have always been driven by the health, security and environmental risks of the activities at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The commissioning of this plant will further add to the multiplicity of operations at Sellafield thereby increasing the risk of an accident. It will increase the volume of worldwide transport of MOX fuel with obvious additional volume of traffic in the Irish Sea thus posing an unacceptable safety and security risk as well as the potential for a major accident or terrorist attack. It will also add to radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. While we are advised that the increases in discharges are likely to be small, any contamination whatever of our marine environment is objectionable and unacceptable. What is particularly worrying about the decision is that it comes at a time when one would have expected countries with nuclear installations to consider the full implications of the recent atrocities in New York and Washington and the very real threat to safety and security of such facilities. I find this decision by the UK Government incomprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware the Government has already initiated action against the UK in relation to the MOX plant under the OSPAR convention. The Irish Government's case began in June and relates to the fact that the UK, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, is withholding information essential to assessing the economic justification of the MOX plant. This process has been continuing on schedule and an arbitration tribunal is in the process of being established under the OSPAR convention to consider this case. I had specifically requested the UK not to take any decision on the MOX plant <Col N="804" /> while the arbitration was in progress. Yesterday's decision is completely contrary to that request and I am very disappointed that the UK chose to proceed despite it.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it will be some time before this plant is fully commissioned. In the meantime and in tandem with the continuing progress of the action under OSPAR, the Government will immediately press ahead with a view to finalising consideration of the further legal options under both EU and UN law with the ultimate aim of having the UK decision on MOX overturned. This process is already well advanced and, based on best legal advice both from our national and UK advisers, the optimum path for proceeding from here will be determined and pursued. I can assure the House that in addition to our legal options, I will continue to press the UK on this matter at every opportunity and to express our concerns on the risks to health, safety, environment, etc., associated with the Sellafield activities. The Government wishes to see the complete cessation of activities at this plant and will spare no effort to achieve that goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister of State's anger at this outrageous decision by the UK Government to go ahead with this plant. The Minister of State outlined the public consultation and said he made effort to convey his concerns to the UK Government. What was the UK Government's reaction? Did this decision come out of the blue or was the Minister of State aware that they were going to go ahead with it? It would appear that the UK Government, or those with whom he was in contact, did not appreciate or understand the strong feeling and objection to this plant. Will the Minister of State outline the UK Government's reaction to his objections? As he said, he is going to continue to make known his opposition to this plant. Is he confident that his concerns will be listened to because obviously they have not been listened to so far? Will the Minister of State outline the legal advice available in terms of advancing this under EU and UN law? Will he give us an idea of the legal advice available that his case will be successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not confident at all that we have been listened to; we obviously have not been. This issue has been going on since 1993 when the then Government opposed this situation when a planning application for the building of the MOX plant was first made. Those objections failed and in 1994 they got planning permission and they proceeded. The plant about which we are talking is built and <i>in situ </i>but its commissioning has been deferred and frustrated, I would like to claim, by Ireland and by many other parties, including residents and groups in the UK and others. There have been five public consultation processes in which Ireland took a <Col N="805" /> vigorous hand and we made very strenuous presentations in each. I suppose one leads to another and the decision to proceed was, let us say, frustrated up to now. It is very disappointing that the UK Government has decided to go down this route, particularly, as I said, in the aftermath of the atrocities in the US.</P>
      <P>I refer to legal action. This is the furthest we have gone yet, and I respect that other Ministers and Governments before I came to office had been actively involved in addressing Ireland's objections and concerns about activities at Sellafield. Successive Governments and Ministers said that they would take a case against Sellafield if there was proper scientific evidence deemed to be appropriate to taking a case and deemed to be appropriate by the Attorney General. This is the first time we have had encouragement or assurance by our legal advisers that there is a viable case to be taken and we have embarked on that case under the OSPAR treaty. I took it to Government earlier this year and got approval to proceed with that action under OSPAR. That has been proceeding on schedule from June last.</P>
      <P>A meeting has been organised for next Tuesday between officials from my Department with their legal backup team and their counterparts in the UK with their backup legal team to further this situation and to do the housekeeping on the arrangements, to set a venue, which will probably be The Hague, and to deal with the appointing of the third arbitrator. We have already appointed our arbitrator in this case. There are three arbitrators &ndash; one to be appointed by each of the parties and both parties together agree on a third. We have appointed our arbitrator. He is from the Australian bench and is a legal man with an economic background which we think is appropriate to the situation. That measure now proceeds.</P>
      <P>In addition, we propose to take further action which I flagged in my presentation to Government earlier this year, that is, under EU law. That is our next step and I spoke to the Taoiseach about it last night. The Government will be discussing it this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the strong and consistent opposition of his Government to the Sellafield proposal has been a dismal failure? I am sure he will be aware of the international expert team that I assembled in 1996 to successfully challenge the BNFL plans for an underground nuclear dump. I am sure he will also be aware of the high level ministerial committee chaired by the Minister for the Environment which supported that expert team during that time. The expert team was headed up by the eminent Queen's Counsel, Professor Lauterpacht. If the Minister of State was serious about taking on BNFL and the British Government on the whole issue of Sellafield and its potential disaster for Ireland, why did he disband the expert <Col N="806" /> team on coming into office and downgrade the ministerial committee? Can we take it that he did not see a need for any expert assistance or the support of a ministerial committee? Does he agree that was the first step in the downgrading of what was a high level legal and diplomatic campaign against the BNFL and the operations at Sellafield and that he replaced that with occasional press releases from his Department drafted by his officials for domestic consumption? Will he further agree that what he is now doing is, effectively, seeking to close the door when the horse has bolted given that he did not take action when he should have?</P>

      <P>It has been in existence for just over three years and has met on some 12 occasions. <Col N="807" /> The committee has a full programme of work, including dealing with the subject matter of the question before the House, namely, the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> MOX. Meetings of the committee have always been attended by the relevant officials from the Departments to which I refer, by officials from my Department as well as personnel from the office of the Attorney General and senior officials from the Radiological Protection Institute, whose input was crucial to our important work of which we are very proud.</P>
      <P>In terms of advances, we seem to be digressing from the subject of the question, we have made more progress than ever before, particularly under the OSPAR Treaty which deals with damage to the marine environment. We have made contact with many other countries and persuaded them to our way of thinking. I visited all the Nordic countries and have written repeatedly to my colleagues in the EU. In the aftermath of the falsification of documents at Sellafield in respect of MOX, a controversy arose in respect of the Japanese market which is the crucial element here. We ensured that our ambassador in Tokyo spoke with the Japanese authorities and advised them that the Irish people were seriously concerned about any resumption of the traffic of hazardous materials by sea. We have interacted regularly with our international counterparts during our time in office and the progress we have made under the OSPAR Treaty represents our greatest success in this area.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that the reason the British Government has not been listening to or has not heard the Irish Government in recent years is that the latter has been whispering rather than shouting? Does he also agree that the Irish Government has been completely politically disarmed in regard to this matter, that its efforts have proved utterly ineffective and that it has not in any serious way challenged the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, or the British Government with the exception of engaging in a number of polite exchanges? Considering the Minister of State's party's position in the 1970s when it wanted to introduce nuclear power into this country, is it really committed to the closure of Sellafield? Does he agree that the Government's approach has been so futile thus far that he should lend himself to the cause as a secret weapon by going on national radio in Britain and terrifying the Government there in the same way he terrified the Irish nation when he was let loose recently in RTE? Such a development might be as effective as the Government's actions to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more serious note, does the Minister of State agree that the development of nuclear technology, in light of what happened at Chernobyl and the horrors visited on New York on 11 Sep<Col N="808" /> tember, is actually a criminal pursuit, particularly when one considers the catastrophe that could result from an accident or an act of deliberate sabotage? Does he further agree that Mr. Blair, the Prime Minister of Britain, is guilty of appalling treachery to the people of this country, not to mention the citizens of his own country? Mr. Blair has expressed sanctimonious pretensions to lead a campaign to avenge the deaths of thousands of innocent people in New York, but his Government, by its policy, is putting the life of countless further thousands, if not millions, at risk, by ensuring that Britain remains a leading agent in furthering this deadly technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious debate and we have been doing serious work. I have been asked a question and I want to respond to it. There is a view abroad in the nuclear industry at present that nuclear power is the answer to all our problems, particularly in terms of the issue of global warming. Those involved in the industry state that nuclear plants do not discharge noxious substances into the atmosphere and that, therefore, the developed world and developing countries should take the nuclear route. We have repeatedly voiced our total objection to that view and we have advocated that developing countries in particular should go the route of pursuing methods of renewable and sustainable energy generation, rather than taking the nuclear route. The atrocity of 11 September has placed matters in a new light.</P>
      <P>We have exhorted many countries at fora under the aegis of the UN, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union. We have repeatedly raised these issues in Brussels and put forward Ireland's view, namely, that we are an anti-nuclear state and that we do not want to see nuclear power being developed in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The responses I have received from people and the liaising I have engaged in at ministerial level &ndash; I have dealt with a number of Ministers during my four years in office &ndash; lead me to believe that if Sellafield is to close, and the Government is resolved to ensure that this happens, it will occur on foot of economic grounds. If MOX is not allowed to proceed, it will sound the economic death knell of activity at Sellafield. That is our aim. We should adopt a united front on this matter and people should not engage in making cheap or snide remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past three years I have had received <Col N="809" /> wholehearted support for my endeavours in trying to spearhead the campaign to close Sellafield. I received wonderful support from Members of both Houses, which has sustained my efforts and helped me put across my message. Deputy</P>
    <P>Higgins is correct: the British are not listening and, therefore, we need to use the big stick. We have sought to use the only big stick we can in this area by taking the legal route. Historically we were advised that we did not have a case. We have sought and received the necessary legal and financial expertise in the nuclear field over the past 12 months and those involved have worked with my officials and the Attorney General with a view to putting this case together. That is why the case is up and running and I hope we will take up the other elements of the case under EU law immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State regretted he was not a senior Minister but perhaps we are looking at a future Fianna Fáil Taoiseach. Given his record, does he believe he deserves to be a Minister or a Minister of State? What did his UK ministerial counterparts say? The Minister of State previously stated in the House that he was encouraged and that he had been given a good hearing by them. Does he accept they have completely pulled the wool over his eyes? How many times did he meet his UK counterparts? We need to know what they said.</P>
      <P>Many people want to know what the Minister of State has been doing for the past four years. He has not been working on an emergency plan because the fact sheet to which he has referred is only being sent out now. However, there is a flurry of activity because Sellafield is again in the news. The pattern is that every time the plant is in the news the Government says it will do this and that and take legal action. Why has a case not been taken over the past four years? Nothing has happened. I ask the Minister of State to inform the House about what he has been doing for the past four years and what he will do prior to the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the House why we have not taken a legal case. Successive Governments and Ministers have probed that avenue and sought the necessary legal advice, which was that sufficient scientific and other evidence was not available to take a case to seek closure or a cessation of activities at Sellafield. We targeted the mixed oxide fuel plant because of its economic significance to the existence of BNFL installations. I am firmly convinced this is the route to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have repeatedly met British Ministers at various fora and these meetings are a matter of public record. We made a case to them, they followed the procedures that are <i>in situ</i> in the UK in terms of independent agencies and they received <Col N="810" /> authorisation to proceed. Notwithstanding the granting of this authorisation, I was still surprised at the political decision taken yesterday.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister of State said it was incomprehensible to him that the decision was made. Given his contribution, it is comprehensible to me why it is incomprehensible to him because he is under the impression that the Government mounted vigorous opposition and that he has made more ground than any previous Minister. Did the Minister of State listen to the opposition of the British Government to the Irish position or was he the equivalent of a poodle sent out to do the work of an alsation? How could this decision have been made? Why did his counterparts not hear what the Minister of State was saying? Why did he not inform the public that the British Government was not playing ball and was leaving us open to more serious worries than is the case currently?</P>
      <P>If the Irish people had been informed they could have rallied around and mounted opposition which could have had an impact whereas we are now chasing the issue. The British Government probably feels it will win the case even though the Minister of State may feel he will defeat the British Government legally or through arbitration. However, the British Government must feel it has everything covered. Why did the Minister pretend discussions were going well when the public could have been a major help to him?</P>

There were five public consultation exercises on the MOX plant over the past four years. The determination of BNFL to build the plant has been well documented. The company spent £450 million building the plant. Its commissioning has been delayed by the actions taken by Ireland and other countries. BNFL was forced to refer to independent agencies in the UK. We have worked with and continue to work with NGOs and other parties in the UK who can help us to get the message across and achieve our ultimate aim which is the closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg will know that we have endeavoured for years to carry out a risk assessment on liquid waste, which is hazardous, at Sellafield. The UK authorities repeatedly told us they would not give us the necessary information to permit us to assess the risk to Ireland of such waste. They always said they would not allow us access to records, etc., and quoted commercial confidentiality as their reason for refusing me and my predecessors. I persevered with my demands and eventually over the past two years, because of the constant pressure, our experts travelled to the UK and carried out a risk assessment. We have received a report on that. We have also made good ground on the OSPAR convention. Discharges into the sea are now the subject of an international agreement and they must cease altogether by 2020 on a graded basis. The UK must outline methods which portray how that will be effected under a legal, binding agreement. A great deal of success has been achieved but the MOX plant is the primary issue as it will extend the life of Sellafield. If the MOX plant is prevented from going into production, it will sound the economic death knell of Sellafield. The only way to make an impact on this issue is through economics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree his inaction and failure in regard to the MOX plant has thrown BNFL the commercial lifeline it needed to continue and if he had succeeded he would have been instrumental in closing the Sellafield plant? Does he further agree the continuing operation of Sellafield and the new proposal for MOX is a constant bone of contention that sours relations between Ireland and Britain? Does he agree that what is required now is a bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister where the strength of Irish public opinion on this matter can be fully conveyed to Mr. Blair? Will the Minister of State tell the House if the Taoiseach has made any plans to convene such a meeting? Given the recent critical safety breaches at the Sellafield plant, does the Minister of State believe the claims by British Nuclear Fuels Limited in relation to safety standards at the plant and about materials in transit? Does the Minister of State agree that this company has a record of evasion, cover ups and untruths? It is a proven liar and its word on safety standards cannot be trusted.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy's latter point. I have articulated many times my total lack of confidence in the integrity of BNFL. I said in the past that it is untrustworthy and this has been proven. There was falsification of documents and the risk assessment investigation to which I referred revealed that many safety aspects were <Col N="812" /> lacking. The general safety culture one would expect in such a hazardous industry is absent.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House this morning that he has, on a regular basis, raised this matter with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. He will do it again forthwith and, as we speak, the Secretary General of my Department and his counterpart in the Department of the Taoiseach are considering the best approach to take. They are also considering, in the context of our ongoing legal advice, how best to elevate the legal battle in terms of the next case under the EURATOM Treaty process at EU level.</P>

The Minister of State is responsible for nuclear safety and in that guise he has explained the progress made to date. However, the decision yesterday is a backward move in terms of the OSPAR Convention. There is a real threat of a terrorist attack on the plant or the ships travelling up and down the Irish Sea.

      <P>Will the Minister of State outline in detail what legal steps will be taken in the week ahead? Does he know it has been speculated that production of MOX will begin in ten weeks? The European Court process which has been mentioned is very long. Is it the Government's intention to seek an injunction in Britain to stop production until the case has been argued at further length? Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland should launch an international call to environmentalists around the world and those sections of the international trade union movement that are opposed nuclear development?

      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the highly active liquid waste that is stored in Sellafield and he said that, if it exploded, it would be equivalent to 550 Chernobyl incidents. If the MOX plant goes ahead, will it add to the liquid waste that is stored there? What stage has the vitrification of that liquid reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="813" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Stagg's point, the vitrification process involves making the liquid waste safer. It is recognised internationally that this process is the best means of treating it. It has proceeded slowly and it was estimated that the accumulated stocks would be treated, vitrified and rendered safer by 2015. We have repeatedly advised the UK authorities and BNFL that we are not satisfied with that and we want the process expedited. I understand MOX will not add to the stocks. I am advised that it is a dry process and that aspect is not one of our concerns.</P>
      <P>There has been contact with Germany and also with Holland and Japan, which is the main customer. We were horrified when we learned of the resumption of transport by sea of nuclear waste and materials and we expressed those opinions. I wrote to Minister Tritton and I received a cordial response. We have raised the matter with the Dutch and we have addressed it through diplomatic avenues with Japan.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Higgins's point, we have been advised in relation to the MOX plant that commissioning will take some months. This gives us time to address the matter. We want to do that immediately and at the most senior level. We are talking about legal action, which has never been taken before. There is no triumphalism on this issue because the wherewithal to do it was not available previously. However, we have reached a stage where we have a sustainable case and we intend to run with it in the various areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Clune's point, we have discussed the arbitration process under the OSPAR Convention. We have also talked about dealing with it under EU law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea &ndash; UNCLOS. We can lodge a claim regarding the failure to carry out a proper environmental impact assessment in the context of the power of the international tribunal under the Convention on the Law of the Sea to order a binding injunction. Our best legal advice, both here and in the UK, will determine the optimum path for us.</P>

        <b>:</b> On 11 September the world was stunned when Sky News and CNN captured the first hijacked airline as it crashed into the New York World Trade Center. Some 20 minutes later the full scale of what was afoot became apparent when the second hijacked aircraft ploughed into the adjacent north tower. The world was stunned and it is still reeling from what occurred. The international, political and security consequences have since become starkly apparent. What came into focus was the issue of airport security. Airport authorities throughout the world carried out an immediate and urgent review of their security systems. The realisation that international terrorism does not know any bounds made it imperative for every country in the western world to realise that countries are not immune from the threat. That terrorists could create carnage on such a massive scale by penetrating the heretofore invincible and invulnerable United States sent shockwaves and a red alert around the world. The message received was that if it can happen in the United States, it can also happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish public was given to understand that Aer Rianta was carrying out a major security review of its systems at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. The travelling public took comfort from this assurance. Many of us recall being asked on occasions to step back from the radar screen at Dublin, Shannon or Cork Airports to empty our pockets and hand luggage of coins or keys. What happened at Dublin Airport last <Col N="815" /> Tuesday, 2 October, has shattered the public belief that airport security is adequate. At 6.25 a.m. TV3 journalist, Suzanne Coogan, presented herself at Dublin Airport departures security to take the 6.50 a.m. Ryanair flight to Birmingham. She had in her hand luggage a handyman multi-tool set. This metal object consisted of pliers, two serrated blades, two other types of blades, three screwdrivers and a can opener. It is important to understand the danger of this lethal weapon. I have an exact replica of what was taken through departures security. It is all metal and it folds up neatly into a sachet.</P>
    <P>The handbag which held this lethal instrument was placed by her on the security conveyor belt and passed undetected through the system. What occurred was a major breach of security. Fortunately, we are talking about Suzanne Coogan, who is a responsible journalist and who was only testing the system. The system failed the test. However, it could have been anybody, such as a person with a psychiatric condition or a suicide intent terrorist. In the wrong hands, this could have been a replica of New York on 11 September.</P>
    <P>This is a major issue of international security. I want to know from the Minister for Public Enterprise what exactly happened. I want to know what steps she is taking to establish how this all metal object, which is more lethal than that which was held to the throats of the unfortunate pilots on 11 September, got through Dublin Airport security. I want to know if the Minister has met the chairman of Aer Rianta on the matter. I want to know if she has examined the airport security video system and what guarantees she has received from the company that there will not be such a security lapse or breach in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, for facilitating me to take this matter now as I am in the middle of a meeting.</P>
      <P>I saw that instrument yesterday when I met Suzanne Coogan. I asked her to talk to me, which she did at length, and I gave her an interview. I then telephoned the chairman of Aer Rianta and asked him to meet me, which he did within an hour of meeting Suzanne Coogan. I told her that she had walked through security smelling of roses because she is a nice young woman who is open faced and acceptable. However, the same open faces and sweetness of expression can hide much more and that is what happened in other areas where security was breached. I was convinced talking to her and later to the chairman, Noel Hanlon, that this was a breach of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I requested a meeting with the chairman, chief executive and other senior management. We were accompanied at the meeting by the assistant secretary of the Department of Public Enterprise who deals with aviation. I initiated this because, like Deputy Jim Higgins, I believe this was a significant incident which happened too easily. The meeting took place yesterday afternoon and I expressed deep concern that this lapse in security should have occurred, particularly given the heightened security procedures which have been implemented at all airports since the terrible events of 11 September. I was and remain disturbed about this incident.</P>
    <P>The week I travelled from Shannon to Dublin I had a small nail scissors in a cosmetics bag in my handbag about which I had completely forgotten. The man checking the computer was able to detect it and he asked me to take it out, which I did. I thought it was good that such a small pair of nail scissors could be detected in a cosmetics bag in my handbag. When I saw the implement, the safety blades and the other items Suzanne Coogan had in her handbag which had passed through security I could not understand how my small instrument had been detected, although I am glad it was. The item she had in her handbag is a frightening implement when it is opened fully. I am sure it is a useful tool when one considers all it can do, but it is not good to have it in one's handbag when one is going through security at an airport.</P>
    <P>I made it clear at the meeting that it was completely unacceptable to have such a reported breach of security and that Aer Rianta must ensure a lapse will not occur again. The lives of air passengers, crew and, sadly from our experience of what happened in the US, the public are dependent on best security practice being implemented. The chairman expressed his disappointment and concern that there appeared to have been a breach of the security procedures at Dublin Airport. He advised me that a detailed investigation was under way to determine the circumstances of the incident and he reassured me that urgent arrangements would be made to ensure that any further lapse in security arrangements does not occur.</P>
    <P>Since the incidents in the US, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, chaired by the assistant secretary in our Department, has convened six special meetings to date, the first of which took place on the day following the incidents in the US and the most recent meeting was held today. The purpose of those meetings was to review existing aviation security procedures in light of the current security situation. The chief executive, John Burke, and senior officials represented Aer Rianta at today's meeting and the reported incident was discussed. The chief executive informed the meeting that Aer Rianta was now investigating the exact circumstances of the <Col N="817" /> incident and had sought the assistance of others to conclude those investigations. I have asked Aer Rianta to urgently complete that investigation and to go back to the National Civil Aviation Security Committee at its next meeting which will be held next Tuesday. I will receive a report of that meeting at which the committee will decide why and how the incident occurred, and what extra security measures must now be taken to ensure nothing of the kind happens again.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the proposed closure of Lilly Industries paint manufacturing facility at Willowfield Road, Ballinamore. The company has been in operation for about four or five years and has given employment in an area that has suffered greatly because of the problems in Northern Ireland, as well as the social problems associated with emigration.</P>
      <P>While it may not have been the largest employer in the area, the loss of these jobs is a blow to the local economy. I hope the Minister, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will immediately seek a replacement project. The premises occupied by Lilly Industries was formerly an IDA advance factory which had remained vacant for approximately 15 years since it was built. The opening of the plant was seen as progress but the decision by Lilly Industries to supply its main customer, Masonite, from another source has caused grave concern.</P>
      <P>In addition to the loss of these jobs, the area also lost approximately 150 jobs following the closure of Ballinamore Textiles five years ago, which was a major blow to the area. The Minister must instruct IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to seek a replacement project at the earliest possible date in order to reoccupy the factory, thus providing necessary replacement jobs.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Ellis for sharing time with me on this issue. The proposed closure of Lilly Industries is a serious blow to County Leitrim, and Ballinamore in particular. As Deputy Ellis has outlined, we had a textile factory which closed five years ago with the loss of 150 jobs. Job losses have also occurred with the closure of Lilly Valspar. The area has become an unemployment black spot because of the lack of replacement job creation. We do not want to see this situation continuing in the town of</P>
      <P>Ballinamore.</P>
      <P>There have also been jobs losses in Drum-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> shanbo in recent months so it has been a particularly hard time for south county Leitrim. I want to see immediate action by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that new industries are brought into the region, including the Ballinamore plant. Prior to its use by Lilly Industries the plant had been empty for up to 20 years as it was extremely difficult to attract industry to the area. It is certainly a black day for Ballinamore but I hope the Government, along with the State agencies, will commit itself to attracting a replacement industry for that factory as a matter of urgency. I would like the Minister to outline what proposals the Government intends to make in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share their disappointment that this company is to close with the loss of six jobs. Lilly Industries of the USA established an operation in Ballinamore in 1997 as a direct response to a request from Masonite to establish an operation close to its facility in Leitrim for the supply of white primer and a clear coat product. The facility was located in the 12,500 sq. ft.</P>
      <P>Ballinamore advance factory.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, the Valspar Corporation of the USA, one of the largest paint and coatings companies in the world, merged with Lilly Industries Inc. As a result, the company is restructuring its operations following the merger. This, coupled with over-capacity in the paint market in Europe, has led to the decision to close the Ballinamore operation which currently employs six people.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I understand that the company has agreed redundancy terms with the employees. Representatives of FÁS Employment Services in the FÁS north-west region will be visiting the company next week. Quality registration interviews will be given to the six staff involved and a skills analysis will be carried out. FÁS will endeavour to find alternative employment for the staff or, alternatively, a place on a suitable training course.</P>
      <P>The company has also put in place service agreements with all its existing customers in Ireland, which will ensure that their supplies and technical service back-up are unaffected by the closure. IDA Ireland is in discussion with the company to agree the manner in which the building can be marketed for future projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 18 months, IDA Ireland has radically changed its strategy with a view to achieving a better regional distribution of jobs. The agency's new strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new inward investment projects, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in each region. This new strategy also provides for an upgrading of IDA Ireland's land in regional <Col N="819" /> locations and the provision of modern facilities in appropriate locations to cater for the emerging sectors.</P>
    <P>The IDA has the objective of delivering 50% of all new jobs from green field projects into the Border, midlands and west region in the period to the end of 2002. Results for 2000 were ahead of expectations compared to the three-year target set out at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Recent positive developments in County Leitrim include: the establishment of a credit card processing facility by MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon, which will create up to 300 jobs; a new 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory which is under construction in Carrick-on-Shannon; Porter and Haylett Ltd. of Norfolk, United Kingdom, acquired the leisure craft hire operation, Emerald Star Line in Carrick-on-Shannon. The company has established a centralised reservations system at the existing offices of Emerald Star Line.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to market County Leitrim for inward investment and every effort will be made to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by this closure.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to what both Deputies have said and I will be in direct communication again, tomorrow, with the State agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the excellent local county enterprise board. Through the collective efforts of those agencies, and with the full support of the Department and the Tánaiste and myself in Government, we will do what we can to find a replacement industry for Ballinamore as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>This matter is important both for Tipperary town and the surrounding area. I thank the Minister for attending the House to address the issue. Continental Promotions International is an American company which as been based in Tipperary for a number of years. It has provided good employment and is held in high esteem in the region. Since the tragic events of 11 September in America, the company has had to lay off some of its workers. I am delighted to note, however, that in recent days the full-time workers have been taken back, albeit only on a 30-hour week.</P>
      <P>The workers are keen to know what the future holds, although they are not getting the answers they should from the company. They are unsure of their individual future prospects. No part-time workers have been taken back and, consequently, they are very concerned. The Minister is familiar with Tipperary town and he knows the area has suffered badly from unemployment. There have been a huge number of job losses in Tipperary over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA has been requested to fill an advance <Col N="820" /> factory in Tipperary town. Unemployment in that part of west Tipperary is higher than in any other part of the south-east region. An application has also been made for Government decentralisation to the area but that is an issue for another day. We are concerned now with the future of the Continental Promotions plant. The company was welcomed to Tipperary but we need to clarify what is currently happening to the work force. I have raised the matter on the Adjournment to bring it to the Minster's attention in the hope that we will receive some assurance for those workers' future prospects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes on his election to the House. I wish him every success here. As a former successful by-election candidate over 19 years ago, I have a special regard for by-election winners.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Continental Promotion International is an American data processing and fulfilment operation. Coupons and other raw data are normally shipped from the United States to Continental Promotion International in Tipperary on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>Due to the tragic events in the United States on 11 September, this process was not possible for a short period of time. The collection and processing of coupons in the USA was also disrupted and, as a result, 60 employees out of a total of 82 in the company's Tipperary operation were laid off.</P>
      <P>The current situation at the company is that all permanent staff have resumed work, although at present on the basis of a 30-hour week. While business activity in the US parent company, on which the Irish operation depends, is down, Irish management has informed IDA Ireland it is hopeful that full-time working can recommence within a two-week time frame. Approximately five temporary staff are still laid off but it is expected that these will be reinstated also.</P>
      <P>We are optimistic about this company and about the future of the operation in Ireland. Obviously, this situation has resulted from the aftermath of the disaster in the United States on 11 September. Let us hope the collective wisdom will prevail, that normal business can be resumed, that mankind can benefit from global co-operation and collaboration, and that Tipperary's international company will also benefit from restored activity as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond. St. Vincent's Hospital, Dungarvan, is 180 years old and is a pre-famine building. There are 31 <Col N="821" /> patients in the hospital with 14 each on the first and second floors. Over half the patients are non-ambulant and a high percentage are elderly.</P>
      <P>The hospital is serviced by an outdoor metal fire escape. As far back as 1982 a South-Eastern Health Board report recognised that it would be difficult to evacuate patients from the premises in the event of a fire. I recently asked the chief</P>
      <P>fire officer for County Waterford, Mr. Tony</P>
      <P>McCarthy, to carry out an inspection of the building. I did so against the background of concerns expressed with regard to fire safety at the hospital. The chief fire officer carried out an inspection and his report is with the South-</P>
      <P>Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>If there is a fire safety problem in the building it should be rectified immediately. It is unacceptable that patients are exposed to any possible fire risk. It is equally unacceptable that staff should be forced to work in anything less than safe conditions. Unless complete safety can be guaranteed for patients and staff, immediate action must be taken to arrange alternative, suitable short-term accommodation within the Dungarvan area. However, it is imperative that the Minister gives immediate approval to put the project and design team in place for the new St. Vincent's District Hospital building. This project was contained in the South-Eastern Health Board's submission under the national development plan. The project has been approved by the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that £160 million has been provided for the South-Eastern Health Board under the national development plan. When the submission was made in March 2000 the estimated cost of the new hospital building was £2.1 million. The estimated cost today would, perhaps, be £2.4 million.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable in this day and age that hospital patients, let alone those who are non-ambulant and-or elderly and who are not at ground floor level, should be dependent on an outdoor metal fire escape. The problems which would arise during inclement weather conditions underline the extent of how unsatisfactory is the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister must give the required approval so the appalling conditions which patients and staff endure at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dungarvan, are brought to an end as quickly as possible and that patients and staff are transferred to a modern, purpose-built hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue concerning St. Vincent's Hospital, Dungarvan. The policy of the Department of Health and Children is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with the wishes of older people, as expressed in many research studies. The policy is also to restore to independence at home those <Col N="822" /> older people who become ill or dependent, to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
      <P>Additional funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, including nursing home subvention funding, while an additional £57.427 million was provided in 2001. This has led to a number of developments for older people in 2001, some of which I will outline.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was provided for enhancing the scope of the home help service to cover more people and to provide more hours for existing clients, as well as providing training courses. A sum of £3.5 million was provided for the balance of the full year cost of implementing the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour from April 2000, including holiday pay. The rate is now almost £7 per hour.</P>
      <P>A total of £5.49 million was provided for the improvement of community support structures, specifically geared towards the support of older people in their homes through a range of measures. A sum of £2 million was provided for carers support. This continues the initiative which began in 1999 to help carers through the provision of, or payment for, a specific service such as respite or assistance in caring.</P>
      <P>A total of £0.6 million was provided to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for the provision of day care services, £0.23 million was made available to a number of voluntary groups such as the Carers Association and £3.65 million was provided for the improvement in staff ratios to help cope with the growing level of dependency in extended care facilities.</P>
      <P>A sum of £14.267 million was provided for improvements in the nursing home subvention scheme and £10 million was made available for the contracting of beds in private nursing homes during the winter period. This has been identified as a measure which will help to reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system. A sum of £15.72 million was provided for the improvement and enhancement of existing services, such as additional funding provided to community nursing units, day care centres and community services and for innovative approaches to the delivery of services for older people at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £2 billion has been made available by the Government for investment in the health services under the national development plan. This represents a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in <Col N="823" /> delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service. There is a commitment to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-hospital sector so that the £2 billion is divided equally between the hospital and non-hospital areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of services for older people it is proposed to provide a greatly improved physical environment to ensure a high quality and client-centred service. Approximately £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The prioritisation and delivery of capital projects under the national development plan in the first instance is a matter for each health board. The South-Eastern Health Board has made provision for the replacement of St. Vincent's District Hospital, Dungarvan, in its proposals under <Col N="824" /> the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The board has established a local group to prepare the groundwork for the project by identifying the services that it would be appropriate to provide in a district hospital and preparing the preliminary planning brief.</P>
    <P>The board has submitted an application to my Department to appoint a project team to the development at St. Vincent's District Hospital. The proposal is being considered and continues to be the subject of discussions between the board and my Department in the context of prioritising and progressing a number of capital projects for the board's area under the national development plan. I am hopeful that a decision in relation to this matter will be made in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 8, 9, 16, 17, 21, 28, 30, 33, 36, 38, 40, 43, 48, 50, 54, 56, 58, 62, 167 to 169, inclusive, 171 to 174, inclusive, 176, 177 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply to the Priority Questions on this subject, in 2000, there were 6.3 million overseas visitors to Ireland who contributed an estimated £2.2 billion or 2.8 billion in foreign revenue earnings, excluding Irish carrier receipts which amounted to £0.6 billion or .75 billion. There were 1.1 million visitors from North America who contributed almost £560 million, 710 million, or 25% of foreign revenue earnings.</P>
      <P>No official estimates are as yet available in relation to the loss of tourism business from the United States and elsewhere arising from the tragic events of 11 September 2001. However, although it is accepted that it is still too early to assess the overall impact on international travel patterns, it is clear that the terrorist attacks in the US are likely to significantly impact on visitor numbers to Ireland, in particular from America, for the balance of this year and into 2002, leading to the first annual decline in visitor numbers for a decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest official CSO tourism and travel statistics, published on Friday, 28 September, indicate that earnings from overseas visitors to Ireland during the first half of 2001 showed an increase of 3.8% to £1.3 billion or 1.65 billion on the same period last year. Overall visitor numbers for the first half of 2001 were down 5.2% to 2.7 million on the same period last year, with the <Col N="829" /> slowdown being most acute in the case of Great Britain and North America. Bord Fáilte now estimate that total overseas visitor numbers for 2001 are likely to show a further reduction on that figure following the terrorist attacks. In my public comment on the latest CSO figures, I said that I was very aware that the impact of the slowdown in visitor numbers this year varies from sector to sector and between regions and that the national trends mask significant variations at local and enterprise level.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's original estimate for 2001 was for an increase of 5% in overall visitor numbers, although that estimate had been revised significantly downwards in the light of the anticipated adverse impact of the foot and mouth disease emergency earlier this year. Ironically, it was clear from earlier mid-year surveys by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development that Irish tourism was beginning to show signs of recovery from this setback, mainly due to the early lifting of the major FMD restrictions in line with expert technical advice and subsequently, due to the beneficial impact of a targeted £10 million international and domestic tourism marketing reassurance campaign by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Since the tragic events of 11 September, both myself and officials of my Department have met with senior management of both Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited &ndash; the new all island tourism marketing company &ndash; and with a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; ITIC &ndash; to take stock of the situation and to put in place arrangements to ensure that marketing strategies will be developed to deal with the fall-out from the recent atrocity for the remainder of this years' season and for 2002. Critical fact.ors will include not only the nature and duration of the response to the terrorists attacks, but also the speed with which public confidence in air travel can be restored.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, ITIC is the principal representative body of the tourism industry and its membership includes hotel and other accommodation associations, such as the bed and breakfast's, the air and sea carriers, other transport groups and tour operators. In our meetings and contacts with ITIC, the various members of the Confederation have an opportunity to brief me and my Department on key issues affecting their individual sectors and their future plans and projections.</P>
    <P>I believe that given the changed environment, it is vitally important that there is a root and branch reassessment of our tourism marketing strategies, including how and where we focus our business, so that the substantial Exchequer funding already allocated for this area under the national development plan has maximum impact. The Exchequer budget for tourism this year will be close to £90 million or 114 million, the lion's share of which is allocated for tourism marketing activities.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, Bord Fáilte and Tourism <Col N="830" /> Ireland Limited confirmed that they were urgently re-examining, in consultation with the tourism industry and through the tourism marketing partnership structure, their respective marketing programmes and plans for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002. Bord Fáilte announced late last week a £750,000 or 950,000 programme of additional immediate measures for the British and Irish markets. Meanwhile, the new chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited is already spear-heading the review of marketing plans for 2002 with the intention of making a major announcement early next month in conjunction with the launch of a new advertising campaign for the island of Ireland. These moves have been welcomed by ITIC and I am grateful for their measured response to the current situation.</P>
    <P>I would expect that these reviews of marketing programmes and plans would take into account the issues raised in some of the Deputies' questions as regards changes in British holiday patterns and the need to exploit potential marketing opportunities in the Nordic and other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Government are also very conscious of the important link between competitive air access and future tourism flows and have been working closely with the Irish aviation sector to help resolve recent difficulties and to help preserve the greatest number of international gateways. My Department has been keeping in close consultation with the Department of Public Enterprise in recent days and I particularly welcome today's announcement by Aer Rianta to extend their discount scheme for new routes to Dublin Airport. Under this scheme there will be no charges for new routes for three years. I also welcome the very attractive discount return fare of $198 introduced by Aer Lingus for its services from New York and Boston to Ireland up to mid-December.</P>
    <P>Given the changed circumstances, I also believe that it is vitally important to quickly bed down the process of institutional change now under way in the tourism State Agencies which have remained unchanged in structure since the early 1960s. It will be critical to complete an orderly handover of responsibility to Tourism Ireland Limited in time for the 2002 marketing season. I also welcome the initial positive expression of support from the council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte to the proposed creation of a new integrated tourism development agency. My intention is that we have strong structures in place to implement our medium-term plans for international marketing, product and human resource development as contained in the national development plan in order to help the tourism industry to meet the major challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I have not discussed the possibility of temporary deferment of tax liabilities for the tourism industry with the Minister for Finance but I understand that in so far as particular cash flow problems arise for individual businesses, the Revenue does as part of normal arrangements look <Col N="831" /> sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis in individual cases where problems are being experienced as a result of a cash flow crisis suffered by the business.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the high level tourism action group, chaired by the chief executive of Bord Fáilte, established in early March this year at the onset of the foot and mouth disease emergency. The purpose of the group was to actively manage issues which were affecting tourism business and to help limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects at home and overseas. The group comprised senior tourism industry figures from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; ITIC &ndash; including representatives of hotels and other accommodation providers, the air and sea carriers and tour operators, together with senior officials of Bord Fáilte and a representative of my Department.</P>
      <P>This group met twice weekly during the height of the FMD emergency but, with the agreement of the industry representatives, was voluntarily wound up in May when the major FMD control measures in Ireland were lifted in line with expert advice, and after the design and launch of a tourism marketing reassurance campaign by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The Government's FMD task force, which is normally chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and which comprises other Ministers and Departmental officials as appropriate, together with representatives of the security forces, is continuing to meet in line with requirements. The task force monitors the FMD situation, co-ordinates the Government response and advises on disease control measures. My Department is represented on this task force by a senior official from the tourism division.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 12, 37, 47 and 175 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 September 2001, the board of Bord Fáilte and the council of CERT announced their intention to take up an invitation by the Government <Col N="833" /> to examine the feasibility of bringing the two bodies together to create a new national agency for the development of tourism and hospitality in Ireland. The Government, on my initiative, had asked the two bodies to consider this proposal in the light of the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island company established under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to market Ireland internationally as a tourism destination from 2002, onwards and the changing needs of a maturing tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland Limited will, in future, be responsible for international marketing, including functions previously carried out by Bord Fáilte such as Brand Ireland advertising programmes, market planning and research and the entire overseas office network. However, in addition to its product and regional marketing role, Bord Fáilte will retain responsibility for helping the Irish tourism industry to develop. This includes responsibility for tourism product investment, statutory functions for the registration or grading of certain tourist accommodation and regional tourism development through the regional tourism authorities.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte also dealt with tourism training until 1963 when the Bord established a dedicated agency, CERT, as a company limited by guarantee, to act as the State tourism education, recruitment and training agency. CERT has broadened its original role of training workers for the hotel sector, to include all tourism and hospitality employment. More recently, in its new statement of strategy, CERT has begun moving in the direction of helping to build industry capability, focusing on human resources management and improving cost competitiveness through encouraging the adoption of best practice in all areas of operation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the next challenge is to ensure that delivery arrangements for those tourism functions remaining with Bord Fáilte and CERT, are the most effective in helping Irish industry to achieve the optimum position for itself in the international marketplace, and so derive maximum economic benefit from the work of Tourism Ireland Limited. Having reviewed the matter I consider that bringing together the product and human resource development functions into one agency might provide the best delivery model for achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>The council of CERT and the board of Bord Fáilte have now considered the proposal to bring the two bodies together to create a new national agency for tourism development and the chairmen have formally reported back to me over the past few days. I am pleased to report that both bodies generally support the merit of the proposal while putting forward a number of detailed views and issues for my consideration. One of my main objectives will be to avoid disruption to delivery of services to the tourism industries by the two agencies throughout the transition process. It is now my intention to consider the matter further, including the views of the two boards, <Col N="834" /> and report back to the Government at an early date to seek a formal decision on the way forward for implementing the proposal.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the supervision of the insurance sector and for ensuring that all Irish policyholders or claimants are treated in accordance with the principle of the Single Market lies with the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>I have not had any meetings with tourism-related businesses affected by the collapse of the company referred to by the Deputy but the Irish Hotels Federation did write to me in connection with their submission to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the matter. I understand that a limited number of hotels may be affected but I have no information to suggest that this unfortunate collapse will have a widespread impact on the tourist sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult case involving complex issues of insurance law at both national and EU level. The current position, as I understand it, is that the policy-holders protection scheme operated by the UK authorities, who are the supervisors of the company under EU law, will not afford any special protection to Irish corporate policy-holders. They will, I understand, have to take their place in the queue as ordinary creditors. I am informed that this particular case has identified a gap in the EU's legislative framework in relation to cross-Border business and is to be taken up in forthcoming EU meetings. If the Deputy wishes to into detail on the issue, I suggest that he takes up the matter with the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 18 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The new national drugs strategy, launched in May of this year, aims to tackle the drugs problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. These actions will be taken by a range of different Departments and agencies who will drive the strategy forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy is the result of a year-long review <Col N="836" /> carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Interdepartmental Group on Drugs &ndash; IDG &ndash; and the national drugs strategy team &ndash; NDST. While the review group recognised that much remains to be done, it also felt that there are encouraging signs of progress in recent years, which suggest that the current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. Accordingly, it concluded that the current approach including the work of the 12 local drugs task forces in the Dublin area, provides a solid foundation to build on for the next seven years. Consequently, the new strategy endorses the existing approach and expands on and strengthen the pillars and principles which underpin it.</P>
    <P>In particular, the strategy recommended, that, in addition to the existing 14 local drugs task forces, regional drugs task forces be established. These task forces will be set in every health board area by the end of the year, including the three area health boards that comprise the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The new task forces will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors and will be responsible for putting in place a strategy to tackle drug misuse specifically for their regions.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group on drugs and the national drugs strategy team will set up an evaluation framework to measure progress under the national drugs strategy. I chair the interdepartmental groups on drugs, which meets monthly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set out in the strategy. Any obstacle to the implementation of any of the actions can be brought to the attention of the IDG at these meetings. A progress report on the implementation of the strategy will be presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion every six months.</P>
    <P>The Departments involved must meet the targets set out in the strategy, and are actively working towards achieving these targets. The first progress report is due in December next.</P>
    <P>In addition, all Departments and agencies involved in the strategy have to prepare a critical implementation path. This will set out the steps they propose to take to ensure that the actions set for them in the strategy are met. These plans are due by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of regional drugs task forces, a series of ten regional seminars were held by my Department and the NDST to provide information on the strategy and to lay the foundations for the setting up of the regional drugs task forces. It is anticipated that the regional drugs task forces will be established by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>Research shows that the main illicit drugs used outside Dublin are still cannabis and ecstasy and that heroin use is still an overwhelmingly Dublin phenomenon. The most recently available figures from the central treatment list show that show that 97% of those on methadone treatment reside in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region and that 96% of the arrests for heroin possession take place in Dublin. That said, we are increas<Col N="837" /> ingly aware through informal contacts with the gardaí and health board that pockets of heroin use are developing in a number of towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is of great concern and I expect the RDTFs to play an important role in identifying any increasing incidences in the misuse of heroin and other drugs outside of Dublin as well as developing proposals in their action plans to address the gaps in services in their areas.</P>
    <P>For further information on the conclusions of the review and the recommendations of the strategy, I will forward a copy of the strategy to each of the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 20 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of Ireland's preparation for and participation in the Sydney Olympics, including <Col N="838" /> the supports, programmes and schemes which where put in place leading up to the games. The report of the review, including recommendations for the Athens 2004 Olympics, was published on 6 February 2001.</P>
    <P>The report outlined 29 recommendations, for the key agencies involved in order to bring about the radical change that is required for success in 2004 and beyond. The review steering group identified the Irish Sports Council as the body best placed to oversee implementation of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Sports Council has met the key agencies, including the Olympic Council of Ireland, national governing bodies of sport and the National Coaching and Training Centre and all parties have committed themselves to the recommendations and to the spirit of co-operation required in the lead up to Athens 2004 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The council also established a high performance committee to assist and advise the council in the development of a high performance strategy for Irish sport, which has recently been completed and which is currently being considered by my Department. A wide range of interests were represented on the committee, including the athletes, NGBs, the NCTC, the OCI, the Paralympic Council of Ireland, Sports Campus Ireland, my Department and Sports Council Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The review of the future role and structure of the NCTC is also under way and a new board of management as well as a new memorandum of agreement and terms of reference for the centre's operation are in place.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the progress made in implementing the recommendation of the Sydney review group it is important to highlight the process and the role played by the national governing bodies of sport in the preparation of our elite athletes and teams for international competition. With the aid of financial support and advice from the Irish Sports Council, the NGBs train and employ coaches, organise training camps and prepare teams to compete in major international events such as the Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships and Home Internationals. The work of the other bodies such as the NCTC, OCI and Paralympic Council should all be seen in the context of supporting and underpinning the work of the NGB on behalf of their athletes.</P>
    <P>With that important role in mind, the Sports Council has worked very closely with the NGBs to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, and the need for strategic planning; the achievement of value for money and the introduction of measurement criteria.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies of Olympic sports have already commenced the development of performance plans for their sports and a liaison group has been established between the Sports Council and the OCI to help maintain liaison and co-oper<Col N="839" /> ation between them and very importantly, to drive and monitor the implementation of the</P>
    <P>Sydney review recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the preparations for future Olympic success are well under way and that satisfactory co-operation is being achieved thus far in the process from all concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 23 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council, which was established on a statutory basis from 1 July 1999, provides funding for a range of programmes to develop and enhance governing bodies of sport, their coaching, training and international competition activities. The National Coaching and Training Centre which also receives funding from the council, provides a range of high quality programmes in coaching and in scientific, physiological services for governing bodies, individual elite athletes, and other related services to elite competitors and squads.</P>
      <P>Funding is also being provided by the Sports Council for the development of programmes to encourage and promote greater underage participation in the major field sports, soccer, rugby, gaelic football and hurling. Additionally, funding is being provided to encourage and promote greater participation by older people in recreational sport and activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international carding scheme, which we introduced in 1998, has provided around £4.5 million for our elite and developing top competitors for their individual development. The council <Col N="840" /> has recently completed a review of high performance sports strategy in Ireland, which follows on the publication earlier this year of the report on Ireland's performance at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and recommendations for Athens 2004.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council is engaged, on an ongoing basis, with the national governing bodies of sports and other agencies in reviewing and monitoring the various initiatives and their effectiveness. Details of the programmes funded by the Sports Council are contained in the Guide to the Operation and the Functions, Records, Rules and Practices of the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>The world class facilities to be provided at Sports Campus Ireland, the 50 metre pool being provided in Limerick, together with the greatly enhanced range and quality of facilities for a wide variety of sports, including athletics, boxing, basketball which have been provided, in addition to the network of facilities at regional and local level, all contribute to an excellent range of supports and facilities available to our top national and international competitors.</P>
    <P>Under the sports capital programme which is administered by my Department, grants to the value of £105.5 million have been allocated to 2,035 projects in every parish, town and city in Ireland since this Government took office. These allocations represent a substantial increase in funding over the £18 million provided for sports facilities over the three years 1995 to 1997. Prior to deciding on funding for national and regional facilities my Department, in addition to the normal assessment criteria, consults with the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. My Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sports facilities.</P>
    <P>A sum of £45 million is available for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02. This programme has given local authorities an enhanced opportunity to submit proposals to refurbish existing pools and to construct new pools under the programme. During 2000 a revised funding mechanism was put in place that resulted in a grant of up to £3 million being available towards the renovation of existing of existing pools or the building of new pools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that that there is now under way an ambitious programme of state assisted expansion in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 24 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, published in November 1999, a number of indicators and targets have been set for tourism performance over the life of the plan. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism were projected to grow at an annual average rate of 5%, while a reduction of two percentage points was targeted over the seven year period in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. In addition, an increase of three percentage points in the proportion of total out of State tourism revenue accruing to the Border, midland and western region was targeted over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>For the year 2000, the first full year of the NDP, foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by approximately 15% &ndash; well ahead of the target of 5% &ndash; while there was a reduction of one percentage point in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. Progress against the regional target was also satisfactory with a gain of over two percentage points in the proportion of tourism revenue accruing to the BMW region.</P>
      <P>While the above outcome is encouraging, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for a single year in the context of multiannual</P>
      <P>target setting.</P>
      <P>Figures for the year 2001 are not yet available. However, due to the adverse impact on tourism of the foot and mouth disease emergency earlier this year and the inevitable negative repercussions for foreign travel of the recent terrorist attacks in the US, foreign exchange earnings from tourism are forecast by Bord Fáilte to be down this year for the first time in a decade. While the NDP targets have to be viewed in the context of a seven year timeframe, it is inevitable that the recent unexpected setbacks will make the achievement by industry of the targets more challenging.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report that good progress is being made in relation to the start-up of Tourism Ireland Limited, TIL, with the intention of the company becoming fully operational for the 2002 marketing season.</P>
      <P>Tourism Ireland Limited was formally incorporated on 11 December 2000 by the North-South Ministerial Council and its board of directors was appointed on 19 December. The board of directors has been meeting regularly since then. The functions of the company are set out in detail in its memorandum of association. In summary, the new company will have responsibility for Tourism Brand Ireland, strategic all-island destination marketing in all markets outside the island of Ireland, international roll-out of regional and product marketing programmes formulated by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the operation of the overseas office network.</P>
      <P>A chief executive has been in place since July and the company recently placed public advertisements for 17 new positions, both in Dublin and Coleraine. Negotiations in relation to the formal transfer of staff from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board are continuing with the trade unions. Meanwhile work is nearing finalisation on a new all-island tourism marketing destination advertising campaign which is due to be launched in early November, together with TIL's marketing plans for 2002.</P>

    <P>The funding levels for Tourism Ireland Limited have not yet been formally determined by the North-South Ministerial Council although the outline annual programme budget has been set at IR£21 million. A North-South funding balance of <Col N="843" /> 1:2 will apply for the programme costs of the company. The Southern contribution to programme costs will be financed out of the tourism marketing fund &ndash; Subhead B.9 of the Department's Estimate &ndash; in line with the commitment for tourism marketing funding included in the national development plan, to be supplemented by additional funding from the North.</P>

      <P>All of the applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed by my Department in accordance with the selection criteria as outlined in section 5 of the guidelines, terms and conditions of the 2001 sports capital programme, a copy of which I am forwarding to the Deputy with this reply. Under the selection process special priority is given to the development of projects in disadvantaged areas and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county. Where appropriate, my Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council and national governing bodies of sport on applications relating to key strategic regional or national facilities. At the end of the selection process each application receives a score which decides its order of priority within its own county.</P>
      <P>Recommendations, based on conclusions from the selection process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution are made to me, as Minister, and I make the final decision on the projects to be funded and the amounts they are to be allocated.</P>
      <P>Extract from guidelines, terms and conditions of the 2001 sports capital programme:</P>
      <P>5.1All applications will be treated on their merits and highest priority will be afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. High priority projects will include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, e.g. pitch development, floodlighting, dressing rooms-showers. Priority for funding under the programme will not be afforded to works which are not essential or integral to sports participation or performance, e.g. landscaping of grounds, boundary fences, equipment stores, car parks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> 5.2 Applicants should note that for the purpose of the programme, disadvantaged areas have been defined as those areas which have been designated by Government under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development. (Current list at Appendix 1).</P>
    <P>5.3Assessment criteria have been developed to help assess applications so that those offering the greatest community benefit are supported. The criteria will focus on: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and/or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, i.e. does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities, possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project, i.e. in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe &ndash; previous track record in fund raising is also taken into account; the level of local funding available &ndash; higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from dis-</P>
    <P>advantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>

      <P>I established a group to undertake a comprehensive review of the operation of the <Col N="845" /> national lottery funded sports capital programme in July 1998. Based on the report and recommendations of this group, I introduced a revamped sports capital programme, incorporating revised guidelines, assessment criteria, terms and conditions, which has been operating since the 1999 programme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the new programme has been of enormous help to clubs and community organisations throughout the country, including those in disadvantaged areas to which special priority is given, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
      <P>The programme caters for a wide range of organisations and their requirements, covering a broad spectrum of activities in a variety of projects, which range in scale from small local clubs to large multi-purpose community venues all the way up to regional and national facilities required by national governing bodies of sport. In all, since the revamped programme was introduced in 1999, almost 5,000 applications have been received and over £99 million has been allocated to almost 1,800 projects.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to carry out another comprehensive review of the programme at this stage the operation of the programme is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis and amended as required to ensure its continued efficiency and effectiveness.</P>

      <P>At present there are seven tourism regions, six of which are administered by regional tourism authorities, RTAs, and the seventh, the mid-west, by Shannon Development. Responsibility for promoting the regions rests with Bord Fáilte, the relevant RTA, and the industry in each region and a series of marketing initiatives by the RTAs is currently being funded by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is probably aware that a review of the RTAs was carried out in 1999 by Bord Fáilte. One of the key features to emerge from the review process was the introduction of a formal annual performance contract, between Bord Fáilte and each RTA, covering issues such as Bord Fáilte funding, visitor servicing, marketing <Col N="847" /> and promotion, tourism development, and the co-ordination role of the RTAs. These contracts were intended to set out the role and what is expected of the RTAs and to lay down indicators for measuring performance. I am confident that the new contractual framework, which marks a major advance in the regional administrative structure, will give increased clarity and focus to the work of the RTAs enabling them to maximise their contribution to regional and national tourism performance.</P>
    <P>I intend, once state aids clearance from the EU is forthcoming, to launch the new tourism product investment scheme under the national development plan which will be implemented by Bord Fáilte in consultation with Shannon Development and the regional tourism authorities, RTAs. This scheme will have a strong focus on less-developed tourism areas. However, I must continue to reiterate that successful realisation of the tourism product development strategy and achievement of its redistribution objective is very much dependent on the relevant local and other authorities delivering the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls and the RTAs have a critical role to play in this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 41 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The pilot initiative on tourism and the environment was launched in February 1998 as a new measure under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, arising from the mid-term review. The objective of the measure was to promote, through grant aid, projects of a pilot or demonstration nature that undertook to contribute to knowledge and understanding of best practice in terms of managing the relationship between tourism and the environment.</P>
      <P>The pilot initiative involved total investment of some £5 million under the operational programme of which £2.6 million was co-funded from the European Regional Development Fund. Full details of the 22 projects approved for funding and the European Regional Development Fund resources allocated in each case are contained in a final evaluation report produced by the external evaluator of the operational programme in September 2000. Copies of this report, which includes a detailed assessment of individual projects at that time, are being sent to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>In concluding that the pilot initiative was a success, the report clearly pointed to the fact that city and county councils and managers had a crucial role to play in the future management of the tourism and the environment interface. I agree with this conclusion and last February I wrote to each local authority enclosing a copy of the report and inviting them to take a lead role in formulating a cohesive and integrated approach to tourism and the environment issues in their areas. I sought their full co-operation and active support in fostering the development of new initiatives and strategies following on from the learning that emerged from the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience gained from the pilot initiative has also led to other innovative initiatives in relation to the management of the tourism environment. For example, one of the projects of the initiative, promoted by the Institute of Tech<Col N="849" /> nology of Tralee resulted in the production of, A Natural Shade of Green &ndash; An Environmental Guide for Hotels, which I launched last year at an Irish Hotels Federation conference held in Malahide in County Dublin. Subsequently, a similar guide for guesthouses was produced by the institute of technology. These guides address issues such as energy efficiency where savings can be made at little cost, reduction in water usage, waste reduction and elimination and the development of an environmental purchasing policy.</P>
    <P>The experience of the initiative and the learning that emerged from project implementation also contributed, in no small way, to the framing of the tourism product development measure to be implemented by Bord Fáilte within the local enterprise development priority of the two Regional Operational Programmes, 2000 to 2006. Across all three sub-measures, one of the selection criteria is that projects will have to demonstrate &ldquo;their environmental sustainability, having regard to best practice in relation to environmental protection including findings from the tourism and environment initiative under the Tourism OP, 1994-99, and the stated conditions set by the planning authorities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Specifically, under sub-measure 3 &ndash; tourism and the environment &ndash; funding will be provided for the promotion of the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment, with a particular focus on the implementation of integrated tourism management plans in established tourism areas. Support will also be available for proposals designed to promote best practice and mechanisms to stimulate the tourism industry to be a positive player in relation to the management of resources, the environment and the development of eco-tourism products.</P>
    <P>The current position in relation to the proposed tourism measure is that its launch awaits European Commission clearance on State aid issues.</P>

      <P>In June 1998 my Department allocated a grant of approximately £280,000 towards refurbishment work at Monaghan swimming pool. This grant was subsequently increased to £300,000 in November 1999 to provide for additional works that were deemed necessary. This grant has not yet been drawn down in full as a final account in relation to these works, required to facilitate the payment of the balance of grant outstanding, is awaited from the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>I had been aware for some time of the need for improved swimming facilities around the country. To address this, the Government approved a considerably accelerated programme of investment in refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme. My Department now has £45 million funding for this programme over the three-year period 2000-02, effectively increasing the annual budget from the £3 million per annum provided by the previous government to £15 million over these three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme, 2000-<Col N="851" /> 20, grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80 per cent of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90 per cent of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool.</P>
    <P>All local authorities were invited to submit proposals under the programme and a total of 51 such proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000. As the feasibility study in relation to the redevelopment of Monaghan swimming pool was not submitted to my Department until April 2001, it has not been possible to have it considered under the current programme.</P>
    <P>My Department has also provided substantial funding towards the provision of the new 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick, which is due to open later this year. The Government has more recently approved the development of an aquatic and leisure centre, at the Campus and Stadium Ireland site at Abbotstown, incorporating a full competition size 50 metre pool.

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 46 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants funded from the proceeds of the national lottery are allocated on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 416 organisations, which were allocated grants under the 1999 sports capital programme had until 30 September 2000 to confirm that work <Col N="852" /> was under way and submit the necessary documentation to the Department so that the grants could be paid out. A substantial number of these projects have been completed while a small number are still in the course of construction. My Department has been in contact with the organisations whose projects have not yet commenced or who have not yet submitted any of the required documentation and has advised them that the grants are being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>In the case of allocations under the 2000 sports capital programme, the 679 organisations, which were allocated had until 28 September 2001 to submit the necessary documentation and evidence that construction work had begun on their project. The vast majority of the grantees submitted most of the necessary documentation by the due date and this is currently being processed by my Department. In the case of grantees which have not submitted the necessary documentation my Department will shortly be advising them that the grants are being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that an amount of 5% of each grant is retained pending the consultant's or architect's certificate that the project has been satisfactorily completed.</P>
    <P>During the course of the years 1999 and 2000, grants amounting to almost £1.3 million were withdrawn from 183 projects, which did not commence on time or which failed to submit the necessary documentation to my Department by the due dates.</P>
    <P>Outstanding commitments under the programme at 31 December 2000 stood at £51.4 million, which includes £35.8 million allocated under the 2000 programme. A total of £13.4 million has been drawn down in sports capital grants in the year 2001 to date.</P>

All applications were assessed in accordance with detailed assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the assessment process the organisation in question was unsuccessful and this decision was conveyed by my Department to the organisation in a letter dated 13 June 2001, <Col N="853" /> together with a copy of the assessment conducted on the application including the score and explanatory comments where appropriate under each of the criteria.</P>
    <P>I intend to advertise the 2002 sport capital programme later this year. In the event that the organisation submits an application under that programme it will be considered in accordance with the guidelines, terms and conditions which will be issued with the application forms for the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>On applying for a grant under my Department's sports capital programme, all applicants are issued with the guidelines, terms and conditions in relation to the programme to ensure that they are fully aware of all requirements both in applying for sports capital grants and in being able to draw them down if their application is successful. In a number of cases each year, however, delays arise on the part of the grantees themselves in a variety of ways, e.g. through delays in supplying information and legal and other documentation requested by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of delays in the Chief State Solicitor's office &ndash; CSSO &ndash; in relation to its execution of deeds of trust and have expressed my concerns on the matter to the CSSO.</P>
      <P>A deed of trust was required for grants exceeding £39,000 up to and including the 2000 programme. In 2001, I increased the requirement to grants of £60,000 or more. The deed of trust provides <i>inter alia</i> for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purposes for which the grant was allocated.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General and the CSSO, is currently examining ways in which the process might be expedited and in which the number of cases on hands as a result of the considerable increase in the number of grant allocations over the last few years can be cleared as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's technical advisers have a monitoring role in grants of over £100,000. Such projects require Office of Public Works approval at the early design stage, based on technical plans and documentation which must be supplied by the grantee. My Department is also in consul<Col N="854" /> tation with the Office of Public Works to examine ways in which this process might also be streamlined in order to expedite drawdown of grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 1,467 applications were received under the 2001 sports capital programme, of which 61 were from County</P>
      <P>Tipperary. Applications are classified and assessed on a county basis and it is not possible therefore to give specific figures related to regions within a county.</P>
      <P>I allocated a total of £43.5 million to 696 projects throughout the country, of which £1,407,500 was allocated to 32 projects in County Tipperary. This is the largest amount ever allocated to County Tipperary under the sports capital programme, representing an increase of over 70% and almost £600,000 on the previous year. In all, the county has been allocated £2,731,500 under the current Government through the 1998-2001 programmes, compared with just £549,000 under the previous Government under the 1995-97 programmes.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories, having regard to the existing range of facilities in each county while also affording the highest priority to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of regional and national projects, <Col N="855" /> my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with the relevant national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. Where appropriate, my Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. In any particular year, the allocation of grants to national and regional facilities, arising particularly from the prioritisation established by the relevant governing bodies of the sports involved, can lead to some apparent distortion of county totals.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the commitment by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the creation of local partnerships. The Irish Sports Council has set out a pathway in its Statement of Strategy 2000-2002 which will be followed in the creation of such partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level.</P>
      <P>The council is currently piloting the concept amongst the eight selected local partnerships which were announced on 2 May last. These are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North and were selected, after open competition, to pilot local sports partnerships. Four other areas &ndash; Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford &ndash; are currently involved in an extensive development process with a view to joining the pilot programme in 2002. It is intended to have completed an evaluation of the pilot by mid-2003 and the proven effectiveness of the concept will determine the extending of the scheme to other areas from end 2003.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited &ndash; IICL &ndash; was a UK authorised insurer; responsibility for the financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European Economic area therefore lay with the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>The Financial Services Authority &ndash; FSA &ndash; in the UK has indicated that IICL policies purchased by private policyholders in Ireland appear to be UK policies for the purposes of the UK policyholder Protection Act and are, in principle, protected policies subject to the policyholders meeting all the other requirements of the Act. The FSA also indicate that protection will be limited to 90% and that policyholders will, in principle, be entitled to return all unexpired premiums up to 90%, provided their policies contain a cancellation condition regarding return of premium, on cancellation. We understand from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland that, in the case of third party claims arising under policies covering compulsory third party insurance, obligation may be made of the bureau for the recovery of insurance cases not otherwise recovered as a result of the failure of IICL.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since becoming Minister I have had sustained and regular contact with the national angling organisations and angling clubs throughout the country. In addition the national salmon commission includes representatives of all the major national angling organisations and inland fisheries interests.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the continued development of the coarse and game and sea angling to the benefit of local recreational and tourism interests throughout the country. The sector faces key challenges, including water quality concerns, pressure on fish stocks and habitats, stiff international competion for tourist anglers, and the impact on angling vistor numbers this year of the FMD crisis. Investment strategies to upgrade tourism angling facilities under the Tourism Angling Measure, 1994-1999, are being continued and enhanced under the NDP measures for both tourism and recreational angling in the regions which will be launched shortly. I have also made available specific funding in 2000 and 2001 for catchment management based development initiatives on a partnership basis between the regional fisheries boards and local angling interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to re-open the railway line from Collooney to Limerick which incorporates the Claremorris to Athenry section.</P>
      <P>However, arising from the report, Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward, my Department will be carrying out a rail strategy study to develop a long-term approach to rail services. It can be expected that the prospects for re-opening the railway line from Collooney to Limerick and other proposals which have a regional development dimension will be examined in the course of the study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the estimated capital cost, excluding rolling stock, of re-opening the railway line from Collooney to Limerick for both passenger and freight traffic is of the order of £100 million &ndash; 127 million approximately.</P>

      <Quest>if there is a system of frequent financial reporting on the performance of Aer Rianta; her views regarding indications that Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports will make an operating loss for 2001-02; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the statutory reporting requirements on an annual basis, Aer Rianta, in common with the other commercial semi-State companies, is subject to the reporting requirements of the 1992 guidelines for State bodies which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the submission of unaudited financial statements covering the first six months of the accounting year.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department also maintain regular contact with management in Aer Rianta on matters concerning company performance and future plans. I myself also meet with the chairman of the company from time to time and these matters would also feature in our discussions.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any indications that the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork will make on operating loss for 2001-02. While the recent downturn in the global aviation sector will undoubtedly have an impact on the profitability levels of most companies in the sector, any suggestion of the three State airports operating at a loss for the current financial year is mere speculation.</P>

      <P>The military authorities have advised that the individual in question enlisted in the Air Corps as an apprentice on 15 January 2001 for a period of nine years permanent Defence Force service and three years reserve service.</P>
      <P>Should the individual now apply for his discharge from the Defence Forces his cause of discharge would be in accordance with Defence Force Regulations DFR A10, paragraph 58(f2&gt;h) &ldquo;By Purchase&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the individual has completed more than three months service and less than one year's service the cost of his discharge by purchase would in accordance with DFR A10, paragraph 61(f2&gt;g) (f2&gt;b)(i) be £1,000. The individual would not qualify for a reduction in this purchase price in accordance with DFR A10, paragraph 61(3) as he has completed less than half of his original engagement of 12 years service. As the regulations are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the steering group, which I set up to undertake a study of the reserve and which reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCÁ and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brig<Col N="904" /> ade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pending completion of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of the reorganisation and restructuring of the reserve, including any proposals relating to units in the Western Brigade, or to make any observations or recommendations on the possible amalgamation of any units.</P>

      <P>The</P>
      <P>tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001 and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC</P>
      <P>Scotia from Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenders received are being subjected to a comprehensive evaluation process which included visits to each of the four companies involved. This evaluation is being undertaken by a project team comprising officials from my Department and Air Corps personnel assisted by an outside consult<Col N="906" /> ant. The team's report will be examined by my Department to ensure policy and procedural compliance, after which negotiations will be entered into with a selected contractor.</P>
    <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation state that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, not necessarily on order of priority: (1) functional characteristics; (2) technical merit; (3) all maintenance and on-line technical support; (4) after sales service and warranty terms on offer; (5) cost and ready availability of spare parts; (6) tender prices; (7) life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>
    <P>I am aware of reports that a company based at Dublin Airport has been guaranteed substantial work should the contract for the supply of the helicopters be awarded to a particular company. However, I am advised that this factor cannot be taken into account as part of the evaluation process.</P>

      <P>The fallen animal collection scheme was introduced on 1 July 2001. Among the conditions attaching to the scheme is that animals must be collected within 24 hours of notification by the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the scheme the collection service has continued to expand to the extent that collection services are now available in all 26 counties. I understand that the services being provided are respecting the requirements for early collection following notification and I also understand that a prompt collection service is now being delivered. Ultimately the success of the scheme relies upon the earliest possible notification of the on-farm death to the collector to ensure that the fallen animal is removed in the <Col N="907" /> best possible condition and with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for State subsidisation of the fallen animal collection service is to significantly reduce and eventually eliminate the number of on-farm burials. It creates important environmental benefits and at the same time integrates fully with both national and EU testing requirements for BSE. Consequently it is only in exceptional circumstances and where BSE is not a factor that on-farm burial is authorised and all such occurrences are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</P>

      <P>In its proposals for the early retirement scheme that commenced on 27 November 2000, which forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06, my Department had included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland), £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland), £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he will be paid on lowland &ndash; more severely handicapped &ndash; first, lowland &ndash; less severely handicapped &ndash; next the mountain grazings last. If a farmer only has lowland  &ndash; more severely handicapped &ndash; and/or lowland  &ndash; less severely handicapped &ndash; his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he has a combination of lowland &ndash; more severely handicappe &ndash; and/or lowland &ndash; less severely handicapped &ndash; and some mountain type land, he will be paid on up to 45 hectares lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an overall limit of 60 hectares. If a farmer only has mountain type land his overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>Payments under the new scheme commenced on Friday, 21 September, as agreed in the Protocol on direct payments to farmers and to date some £145 million has been paid to some 84,757 farmers representing over 85% of total applicants. This compares very favourably with the figure of just over £59 million which was paid to farmers at this time last year under the old animal based headage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the classification of land is concerned the position is that when the disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance schemes were first introduced in Ireland in 1975 the disadvantaged status of all land in the country had to be determined. In general land was classified as non-disadvantaged, less severely handicapped <Col N="909" /> and more severely handicapped. A number of reviews of disadvantaged areas have since been carried out most recently in 1996. When the sheep headage element of the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes was being introduced it was decided that certain sheep farmers who had mountain breeding ewes which were substantially maintained on mountain type grazings should be paid headage grants on such ewes. Mountain breeding ewes were defined as Blackface Mountain (horny) and Cheviot, and first crosses between or on these breeds. No sheep headage grants were payable to farmers who maintained other breeding ewes. All applicants for grants under the various headage schemes were subject to an on-farm inspection. In the case of applicants with mountain type breeding ewes the inspecting officer from my Department certified (a) that the sheep were of the correct breed and (b) that they were being substantially maintained on mountain type grazings. When the land parcel identification system was introduced in 1996 it became necessary to identify all land areas which were traditionally treated as mountain type grazings for sheep headage purposes in order that sheep headage grants could continue to be paid to those farmers who maintained mountain breeding ewes. In designating such areas on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place. However, the designation of mountain type grazing suited most farmers especially those engaged in sheep production allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain breeding ewes.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulty which this mountain classification causes under the new area based compensatory allowance scheme and I am currently reviewing the scheme with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>A written approval for grant aid under the scheme of investment aid for farm waste management issued to the person named on 23 August 2001. The amount of aid approved was based on my Department's standard costings and the investments which the person in question had agreed to undertake. The standard costings were reviewed prior to the introduction of the scheme in February 2001 and were increased on average by 11.5% on the 1999 costings. The costings are considered to be a fair and accurate reflection of the average cost of carrying out investments, excluding value added tax. While there is a commitment to an annual review of the standard costings under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, any increase will only apply to grant aid approved after the date of application of the most recently approved costings.</P>

      <P>The position is that the new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland); £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland), £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Mountain type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named has been paid a total of £2,578.71 in respect of 6.18 hectares of more severely handicapped lowland at £70 per hectare and 47.69 hectares of mountain at £45 per hectare.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 provides for payment of £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares of mountain type land. This scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of EU Council Regulation 2079/92, under which the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was introduced, that any national retirement pension to which a scheme participant becomes entitled must be offset against his or her early retirement pension. In July 2001, my Department received confirmation that the person named had been awarded a contributory old age pension with effect from 10 November 2000. This pension should have been offset against his payments under the early retirement scheme from that point, and therefore he had been overpaid in the meantime. My Department is obliged to recover such overpayments.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the contributory old age pension was not paid directly to the person named until June 2001 because the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs withheld it in the meantime against an amount which he owed to a health board. Nevertheless, he had been the beneficiary of the old age pension since he qualified for it in November 2000 and it is from that date that it must be offset against his entitlement under the early retirement scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two schemes administered by my Department which <Col N="915" /> provide financial support for the development of organic farming in Ireland, namely the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; and the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was approved under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Participants in REPS may avail of a supplementary measure designed to encourage organic producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. An organic farmer can receive up to £5,702 a year on top of his or her basic REPS payment of up to £4,757 while in conversion to organic farming, and up to £2,867 extra thereafter.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was introduced earlier this year, provides grant assistance in respect of investments in equipment and facilities for the production, preparation, grading, packing and storage of organic products. For on-farm investment projects costing over £2,000, the Department will give 40% grant assistance, up to a maximum of £40,000. For off-farm investment projects costing over £2,000, 40% grant assistance is again available up to a maximum of £200,000.</P>
      <P>The closing date for the first tranche of applications was the 29 June 2001 and these applications are currently being evaluated by my Department. The scheme will be advertised again in due course and further applications will be invited.</P>
      <P>In line with a recommendation of the agrifood 2010 committee, I have established an organic development committee and asked it to recommend a coherent development strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets; and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity. I look forward to receiving the committee's recommendations in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; and mountain type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares. Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he will be paid on lowland, more severely handicapped, first, lowland, less severely handicapped, next and the mountain grazings last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a farmer only has lowland, more severely handicapped, and/or lowland, less severely handicapped, his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he has a combination of lowland, more severely handicapped, and/or lowland, less severely handicapped, and some mountain type land, he will be paid on up to 45 hectares lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an over<Col N="917" /> all limit of 60 hectares. If a farmer only has mountain type land his overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements involve a cost of about £180 million in 2001 representing an increase of about £60 million over the old animal based headage scheme. It is estimated that about 75,000 farmers stand to gain from these new arrangements while some 24,000 farmers stand to lose money when compared with payments under the old animal based headage schemes. While some farmers stood to lose money in the changeover, I negotiated a compensation package with the European Commission under which 90% of any loss would be made good this year. The payments now being made to farmers include this compensation for losses in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In so far as the classification of land is concerned the position is that when the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes were first introduced in Ireland in 1975 the disadvantaged status of all land in the country had to be determined. In general land was classified as non-disadvantaged, less severely handicapped and more severely handicapped. A number of reviews of disadvantaged areas have since been carried out most recently in 1996 resulting in some 75% of land in Ireland now being classified as disadvantaged. Some 59% of disadvantaged land is classified as more severely handicapped while the remaining 16% is classified as less severely handicapped. Some 94% of County Clare is classified as more severely handicapped with the remaining 6% being classified as less severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>When the sheep headage element of the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes was being introduced it was decided that certain sheep farmers who had mountain breeding ewes which were substantially maintained on mountain type grazings should be paid headage grants on such ewes. Mountain breeding ewes were defined as blackface mountain &ndash; horny &ndash; and Cheviot, and first crosses between or on these breeds. No sheep headage grants were payable to farmers who maintained other breeding ewes. In those days all applicants for grants under the various headage schemes were subject to an on-farm inspection. In the case of applicants with mountain type breeding ewes the inspecting office from my Department certified first that the sheep were of the correct breed and second that they were being substantially maintained on mountain type grazings. When the land parcel identification system was introduced in 1996 it became necessary to identify all land areas which were traditionally treated as mountain type grazings for sheep headage purposes in order that sheep headage grants could continue to be paid to those farmers who maintained mountain breeding ewes. In designating such areas on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place. However, the designation of mountain type grazing suited <Col N="918" /> most farmers especially those engaged in sheep production allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain breeding ewes.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulty which this mountain classification causes under the new area based compensatory allowance scheme and I am currently reviewing the scheme with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders.

    <P>I have requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues.

Depending on patient requirements, the number of long-stay beds can be increased to a maximum of 50, while ensuring there is an adequate number of beds to facilitate direct admissions from the community and transfers from other hospitals. The recent appointment of a senior physiotherapist to the hospital should support this arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer &ndash; CMO &ndash; at my Department asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter.</P>
      <P>The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the speciality and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute has replied to the CMO and con<Col N="930" /> firms that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly in the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. Excellent results were claimed for this procedure which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis. Sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute states that in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicate favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</P>
    <P>The institute states that from 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was replaced by the modern caesarean section. Antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made since the 1950s and 1960s and medical care and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Statistics in relation to the number of women who underwent a symphysiotomy in maternity hospitals by each health board area are not available in my Department. However, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to take up this matter and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any compensation claims to date in respect of women who underwent a symphysiotomy in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The working group established by my Department in June 2000 to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development produced its first report on 1 March 2001. The report contained recommendations on the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and hyperactivity kinetic disorder &ndash; ADHD-HKD.</P>
      <P>The working group recommended that the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service throughout the country, through the provision of additional child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams and the development of closer liaison with the educational services, community services and GP services, would represent the most effective means of providing the required services for sufferers of ADHD-HKD.</P>

It is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area, to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants and to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid.</P>

      <P>Under the current tenant purchase scheme, which came into effect in May 1995, sale prices are based on the market value of the dwelling in its existing state of repair, less certain discounts. It is a matter for the local authority to arrange for the valuation of dwellings being offered for sale. The terms of the scheme, as notified to local authorities, require that tenants should be advised that the valuation will stand for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as the local authority may decide and that tenants who wish to purchase, within such period, should agree in writing to proceed with the purchase. It is, therefore, a matter for each local authority to decide on the period for which the sale price will stand, subject to the maximum limit of 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the social and affordable housing provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. In accordance with section 94 of the Act, planning authorities have completed their housing strategies by the end July 2001 deadline. The authorities have or are in the process of incorporating the strategies into the development plans by means of a variation. The social and affordable housing conditions can only be applied to planning applications made after the strategies have been incorporated into the development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing strategy must provide for the existing and future housing needs of the area covered by the development plan and must set out how this will be achieved. The needs assessment would be based on a number of factors, including the current and future demand for housing generally, the existing and likely future needs of persons requiring social housing, the existing and likely future affordable housing <Col N="935" /> needs having regard to economic trends, such as in house prices and disposable income, and the existing and likely future demand for private rented housing. The Act also requires planning authorities, in developing their housing strategies, to ensure that policies and objectives are in place which will counteract undue social segregation in housing developments between people of different social backgrounds. Up to 20% of all land zoned for residential development may be reserved to meet the identified needs for social and affordable housing. Different percentages can be specified for different areas subject to not exceeding 20% or the general percentage specified in the housing strategy if lower. However, to avoid undue social segregation a local authority can decide that no social and/or affordable housing requirement or a lower requirement should apply in a particular area. Under the Planning Acts, planning control is an executive function of the planning authority, vested in the manager. This function can be delegated to officials of the authority including directors of services, in accordance with local government legislation. In considering planning applications, a local authority is required to have regard to the provisions of the development plan including the social and affordable housing provisions the adoption of which is a reserved function.</P>

A total of £7 billion &ndash; 8.89 billion, 1999 prices &ndash; is being provided over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for social and affordable housing. As well as the provision of local authority housing, a range of additional schemes and grants are operated by local authorities to improve existing dwellings and facilitate the provision of private dwellings. These include schemes or programmes relating to homeless accommodation, Traveller accommodation, affordable housing scheme, shared ownership scheme, essential repairs grant, disabled person's grant, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, local authority extensions scheme, low cost housing sites, mortgage allowance scheme, local authority loans for home purchase and improvement and tenant purchase scheme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards for entry to positions as professional planners in the local authorities are as follows: candidates must hold a qualification in town planning recognised by the Local Appointments Commissioners and have a minimum of between three and seven years satisfactory post-graduate experience of town planning, depending on the post involved. Newly graduated planners without any professional experience are eligible for assistant planner posts in the local authorities. The assistant planner grade is also open to individuals without a qualification in town planning recognised by the Local Appointments Commissioners but who have a relevant qualification, for example, architecture, engineering, chartered surveying, environmental economics, geography, and who have at least two years' relevant experience. In general, candidates for all planner posts would be expected to possess a high standard of technical training and experience. At present, two third level institutions, University College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology at Bolton Street offer third level planning courses. From September last, an increase in the capacity of the existing planning course at UCD and the introduction of new courses at both UCD and Dublin Institute of Technology will result in a trebling of the output of graduate planners from these courses to 75 per annum from next summer.</P>
      <P>A variety of other measures has also been taken to maximise the supply of professional planners to the planning authorities. In order, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued. In this regard, my Department along with a number of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, participated in the FÁS Jobs Ireland Campaign earlier this year in the UK and South Africa to source professional planners on a contract basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second phase of the recruitment campaign, the Local Government Management Services Board has taken the lead role. An advertisement for agencies to source construction professionals &ndash; planners, engineers, quantity surveyors, architects etc. &ndash; for contract work was <Col N="937" /> lodged in the Official Journal of the European Union in June. Proposals were received from 13 agencies and are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>My Department conducts surveys of the larger planning authorities, i.e. county councils and county borough corporations, on a periodic basis, <Col N="938" /> to establish the level of serving staff in planning departments. Details of the staffing levels in local authority planning departments over the past three years, including information in relation to professional planners, where available, are set out in the attached table.</P>

      <P>My Department's objective in this area is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial framework within which local authorities, voluntary bodies and Travellers may provide or be assisted in the provision of management of accommodation for Travellers.</P>
      <P>One of the principal requirements of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, is the preparation, adoption and implementation by relevant local authorities of five year programmes to accelerate the provision of accommodation for Travellers. All relevant local authorities have adopted and are currently implementing their respective programmes involving the provision of some 3,785 units of accommodation over the five year period from 2000 to 2004.</P>
      <P>The result of the latest annual count of Traveller families undertaken in November 2000 shows that the total number of Traveller families accommodated or assisted by local authorities, or on the roadside, was 4,898.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for this scheme submitted to my Department by Kilkenny County Council in the mid-1980s, and revised in February 2001, have not been approved. The scheme was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the need for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Because of the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>The special pre-1953 pension was introduced by me from May 2000 and provides for a flat-rate old age contributory pension payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate for people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who have at least 260 paid contributions, at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a combination of contributions made before and after 1953. This measure is primarily designed to benefit people with pre-1953 insurance who, because they cannot satisfy the normal yearly average rule, did not qualify for a contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The rate paid to those qualifying for this special pension is the same as that paid to someone receiving pension under the standard qualifying conditions with a yearly average of ten to 14 contributions over their working lives. A similar payment is also being made to those receiving the special self-employed pension introduced by me in 1999.              </P>
      <P>Since its introduction, some 7,400 new pensions have been awarded with a further 10,300 applications currently at various stages of processing. In addition, 8,500 people who were already in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or retirement pension at less than 50% of the maximum personal rate have also benefited from this measure.</P>
      <P>Proposals to increase the level of the pre-1953 pension, and other similar payments, would have very significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>There are over 111,000 people receiving support through an old age non-contributory pension or widow's-widower's non-contributory pension from my Department, at an aggregate cost of over £472 million in 2001. Some 10,300 of these people are receiving this pension as a supplement to their British retirement pension income.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to old age non-contributory and widow's-widower's non-contributory pension, the Social Welfare Acts specify that account must be taken of all income, including British or other pensions, for means assessment purposes. Under this legislation, pensioners are required to notify my Department of any change in circumstances which might affect their pension entitlement. Where they do not do so, the result is that they receive higher amounts of Irish pension than they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been substantial increases in Irish <Col N="940" /> pensions in recent years and the means test for qualification for pension has been substantially improved. The basis of the schemes, however, is that income is assessable under the same rules whether it arises from a British pension or any other source and it would be unfair to other pensioners if income from British pensions were to be treated more favourably.</P>
    <P>The value of British retirement pension for Irish resident recipients has increased in recent years directly through growth in rates of payment and indirectly through a beneficial sterling rate relative to the Irish pound. Where these increases are notified to my Department, they have to be taken into account and the rate of Irish pension appropriately adjusted.</P>
    <P>In the context of reviews of pension entitlements, British retirement pension income is assessed for means purposes using the sterling to euro rate of exchange, either at the date of the last increase in British pension or the rate of exchange in subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner. Any pensioner who experiences a revised decision on their entitlements have the right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. It is also open to them at any stage to request the Department to review their means if their circumstances change, for example, if the value of their other income drops.</P>

      <P>The back to school cloth<Col N="941" /> ing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. Details of the income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full-time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years which enable people participating on approved employment schemes to retain secondary benefits, including BSCF, that were in payment prior to commencing the scheme subject to certain conditions. One of the conditions that must be satisfied in order to retain entitlement to BSCF while participating on an approved employment scheme is that the gross household income must not exceed £250 per week.</P>
      <P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person in question and has advised that she is a lone parent who is participating on a community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; scheme. Her weekly income from her one-parent family payment and CE scheme is in excess of £300 per week and, accordingly, her application for BSCF allowance was refused on the grounds of excess means.</P>
      <P>Income limits for various household sizes are as follows:</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has a weekly income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation cost. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that a rent supplement of £461 per month had previously been in payment. During the course of a review of the rent supplement the community welfare officer &ndash; CWO &ndash; sent a review form to the person concerned. The review form was not returned and the person in question made no contact with the CWO, thus payment of the rent supplement ceased with effect from 26 June 2001. If the person in question feels that she still qualifies for rent supplement she should contact the CWO at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that in my answer to a similar question put by him on 30 May 2001 &ndash; Parliamentary Question No. 213 refers &ndash; I stated that the detailed information sought, being a day-to-day operational matter, was primarily an issue for the undertaking itself and for Údarás na Gaeltachta and would not normally be provided in a reply to a parliamentary question. However, the information sought by the Deputy at the time was requested by an tÚdarás from the company as an exceptional measure and was provided in the reply to that parliamentary question. An tÚdarás will, in the normal way, be seeking information regarding staffing levels in the company for its year-end survey of Gaeltacht employment. This information will be available before the year end.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy was informed in reply to his question of 30 May, in the week ending 18 May 2001, a total of 112 workers &ndash; 40 full-time and 70 part-time &ndash; were employed in the business. I understand from an tÚdarás that it is satisfied with the company's progress since then as regards employment creation. It would be unrealistic to expect an tÚdarás to have information on a monthly basis in respect of this or any other company under its aegis and, accordingly, it is not proposed to ask the company to provide comparative employment figures monthly from last January.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this dealing refers to an application under section 49, that is, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, which was lodged on 10 March 2000. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 16 August 2001 and the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can assure the Deputy that, on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency &ndash; RIA &ndash; is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of direct provision. The RIA currently has a nationwide portfolio of 85 properties for this purpose. These properties comprise former convents, guesthouses, hotels, bed and breakfast facilities, hostels, nursing homes as well as mobile homes parked on State-owned sites and a former holiday centre. In addition, a number of system-built buildings, that is, demountable prefabricated units, are currently being constructed for the purpose of providing accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer the Deputy to previous parliamentary questions on consultants engaged by my Department &ndash; Parliamentary Questions Nos. 377 on 26 June 2001 and 206 on 11 April 2001. The changes which have occurred since then are as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the prisons building and refurbishment programme, my Department has, on an ongoing basis, engaged consulting architects, consulting engineers and other specialists as appropriate to each particular project. The total cost for these services to my Department over the period specified is estimated at £4.5 million approximately. It would not, however, be appropriate to break these figures down to reveal the cost of each consultancy or contract because of the market sensitive nature of this information. Furthermore, in the interest of the security of prisons, it is not considered appropriate to identify consultancy firms or individual consultants in relation to prison works or prison building projects.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers and a number of family members were approved for naturalisation by a previous Minister for Justice under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986. Given the ministerial discretion which is embodied in that Act regarding the granting of certificates of naturalisation, it is not for me to determine the basis on which that discretion was exercised. The names and addresses of the indi<Col N="958" /> viduals concerned appeared in<i> Iris Oifigiúil </i>on 1 and 8 September 1992. It has been long standing practice in my Department that details of individual applications for naturalisation, apart from those which are published in <i>Iris Oifigiuil,</i> are treated as confidential and I do not intend to depart from that practice on this occasion. I am aware of newspaper reports which comprehend the circumstances outlined in the Deputy's question. In so far as the current worldwide investigations into the recent atrocities in the United States are concerned, the Garda is assisting in the investigations and it would not be prudent to comment on specific aspects of them at this time.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, empowers me to revoke certificates of naturalisation if I am satisfied that the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances; that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; that, except in the case of a person of Irish descent or associations, the person to whom it is granted has been ordinarily resident outside Ireland, otherwise than in the public service, for a continuous period of seven years and without reasonable excuse has not during that period registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister; that the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country; or that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that if the circumstances of any particular case warrant revocation under these provisions, I will have no hesitation in doing so.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) was transferred to another prison; if this person will be referred back to Castlerea Prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to is serving concurrent sentences of 12 and six months for intimidation and assault. He was transferred from Castlerea Prison to Fort Mitchel Place of Detention, for operational reasons, on 19 September 2001.</P>
      <P>Transfers for operational purposes may be necessary for a variety of reasons including overcrowding, the need to protect a prisoner from other prisoners, to prevent planned disruption, as part of a penalty for breaches of prison discipline or simply to reallocate cell space to another prisoner or group of prisoners. This particular transfer was effected because of overcrowding in Castlerea Prison which necessitated transfers to other closed institutions. On the day in question there were 194 prisoners in custody in Castlerea Prison, which has a bed capacity for 182 prisoners, and in order to free up space a number of prisoners were moved to Fort Mitchel Place of Detention which had seven vacancies on that day.</P>
      <P>Where possible, the Prison Service attempts to accommodate prisoners in the institution nearest to their home address. However, this is not always possible, particularly in committal institutions which have to take in prisoners directly from the courts and would clog up very quickly without transferring prisoners to other suitable locations. Castlerea Prison had 900 committals in the year 2000 and it is obvious that not all of these prisoners could serve their full sentences at that location. I can, however, inform the Deputy that two additional houses have recently been constructed in the &ldquo;Grove&rdquo; area of the prison. These houses, when operational, will cater for 16 additional prisoners and it is expected that these facilities will be brought into use by year end. In addition, planning is under way for the construction of a new cell block which will provide 85 additional places. Its construction will commence mid next year.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the director general of the Prisons Service that the person referred to has not applied for a return to Castlerea Prison. However, I would have no objections to such a transfer taking place. I should point out though that, for reasons referred to above, spaces in Castlerea Prison are at a premium and it is not always possible to arrange such movements in a short time frame.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 153 to 155, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The anticipated announcement is not in terms of a national tourism plan but rather the proposed tourism product investment scheme, which is to be funded under the local enterprise development priority of both the BMW and S&amp;E regional operational programmes. As I explained previously to the Deputy in my letter of 28 August 2001, the scheme has not been launched as yet because for the first time such a scheme has had to be individually notified to the Competition Directorate of the European Commission, under state aids rules for regional aid.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between my Department and the Commission's Competition Directorate are ongoing and have proved unexpectedly difficult. As soon as clearance is secured, I will formally launch the scheme and make every effort to ensure its efficient implementation. By way of factual information, I am arranging for the Deputy to be sent an extract from the BMW operational programme covering the programme complement for tourism sub-measures 1 to 3. In line with the eligibility rules for Structural Funds and, in particular, the guidelines on regional aid, eligible expenditure cannot pre-date state aids approval and detailed appraisal of proposed projects.</P>

      <P>Following a Government decision on 1 May 2001, independent consultants, High-Point Rendel, were engaged to undertake an overview of the cost of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project. The steering group of senior officials overseeing the work hopes to have its final meeting with the consultants within the next seven days. It is envisaged that the report <Col N="961" /> will be submitted to the Government later this month.</P>
      <P>Until the steering group has submitted this independent report to me and I have submitted it to the Government for its consideration, I do not intend to make any statement on its contents. In the meantime, the most recent estimate available as to the cost of the project remains at £550 million as estimated by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited. To date, £11,853,558 has been expended on the planning, preparation and development of the Sports Campus Ireland project, of which £2,878,151 was expended through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach and the balance from my Department's Vote to which responsibility for funding transferred with effect from 1 January 2001.</P>

      <P>One of the key recommendations in the national drugs strategy, 2001-08, which was launched in May 2001, is that regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, be set up in each of the health board areas to develop appropriate policies for their regions. In this context, a series of ten information seminars on the new strategy were recently held throughout the country at which representatives from my Department and the national drugs strategy team made presentations on various aspects of the strategy. The sessions were attended by representatives of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors and were also open to members of the public. One of the main issues discussed at the sessions was the setting up of the RDTFs, which will be the overall responsibility of the national drugs strategy team. It is intended that the RDTFs will be established by the end of 2001.</P>

On 4 July 2001 my Department sent a written request to the club for further information and various items of documentation required to facilitate the draw down of its funding. To date none of the information or documentation requested has been forthcoming from the club.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme administered by my Department grants to the value of £105.5 million have been allocated to 2,035 projects in villages, parishes, towns and cities right throughout Ireland since this Government took office. This funding, which supports the provision of sports and recreational facilities which benefit local communities, represents a substantial increase in funding over the £18 million provided for sports facilities over the three years 1995 to 1997. In addition, the Government has provided a sum of £45 million for the period 2000-02 under the local authority swimming pool programme. The previous Government had provided a total of just £3 million per annum for the implementation of this programme.</P>
      <P>I intend to advertise details of the 2002 sports capital programme later this year. Under the programme it is open to voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies of sport, schools, colleges and local authorities to apply for support towards the provision of sports and recreational facilities.</P>

Meanwhile the closing date for the receipt of outline bids for the stadium and other sports facilities at Sports Campus Ireland was 21 June last. I am informed by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, the company responsible for the development of the project, that submissions received by that date are currently being assessed. No decision will be made on any of these bids, however, until such time as the Government has first considered the report of the consultants.</P>

      <P>An application was received from the Sacred Heart secondary school, Westport, County Mayo, under the guidance enhancement initiative for second level schools. The objective of the initiative is to develop innovative ways of enhancing guidance through promoting links between schools, business, voluntary and State agencies and increasing the uptake of science subjects. Over 400 second level schools submitted proposals for a career guidance post allocation under the initiative. Decisions on the selection of proposals for support were made in accordance with agreed criteria on the recommendations of a <Col N="968" /> selection panel involving experts in the field of guidance and project management. Some 50 new guidance posts were allocated under this initiative which will directly support proposals submitted by 103 schools.</P>
      <P>The application from the Sacred Heart school was unsuccessful on this occasion. The position of the school will be considered in the context of any future expansion of provision for guidance in second level schools. The principal of the school was notified to this effect in a letter which issued to the school on 27 August 2001.</P>

      <P>In the vocational sector, the teacher allocation is generally determined on a vocational education committee scheme basis rather than on an individual school basis. The allocation of teaching posts to individual schools from within the overall approved allocation for a particular VEC scheme is a matter for the chief executive officer with the agreement of the committee concerned. My Department has been advised that 10.277 whole-time teacher equivalents have been allocated to Westport Vocational School in the current year.</P>

      <P>The report of the expert group on var<Col N="969" /> ious health professionals, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and chaired by Dr. Peter Bacon, identifies a need for additional graduate output in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that initiatives should be put in place to improve the supply of qualified personnel in each of the three therapy professions as a matter of urgency. It further recommends that the scope for the fast-tracking of qualifications be examined, for example,  graduate entry conversion type courses which would provide an early increase in the supply of personnel.</P>
      <P>At my Department's request, the Higher Education Authority has been exploring various options for further increases and has been in touch with the Department of Health and Children regarding related issues including the question of clinical placements. The Higher Education Authority has also issued a call to institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes. The closing date for receipt of such proposals is mid-October.</P>
      <P>As an interim response to the shortage of therapists arrangements were made to increase the number of places offered on the relevant programmes for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to liaise with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, in order to ensure an adequate supply of qualified personnel in the three therapy professions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Scoil Treasa, Firhouse, Dublin 24, does not have recourse to full-time secretarial assistance; the action he will take on this matter; his views on whether the school can properly function without appropriate administrative secretarial assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
      <P>Scoil Treasa shares the services of a full-time secretary under the 1978-79 scheme with another school. However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my officials will be writing to both schools shortly outlining proposals to allocate the post in its entirety to one of the schools concerned. The other school will then become eligible for additional funding under a more extensive grant scheme that was introduced in the PESP agreement in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita </i>grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Both schools have <Col N="971" /> already been included in this scheme for caretaking support.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
    <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now near finalisation and details on the new funding arrangements will issue to all schools very shortly. This will give a major boost to schools throughout the country and represents the implementation of an important commitment in the programme for Government and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the association is no longer in a position to continue the transport service, my Department has been requested to provide a suitable alternative transport service for the pupil. <Col N="972" /> My Department offered a transport grant to the child's parents to assist them in making private transport arrangements. However, the child's parents have requested that a transport service be put in place.</P>

      <P>In the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
      <P>My Department instructs all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to ensure that the candidate is given credit for all work done. However, in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty he or she is instructed to send the answer book to his or her supervising examiner.</P>
      <P>Where a candidate opts to appeal the grade awarded in a particular subject, the re-marking is done in accordance with the original marking scheme. The objective of the appeals process is to detect and correct any error in the original marking and in doing so to ensure that all examination candidates are treated in a fair and even-handed manner. The appeals process is rigorous and has the integrity to detect and correct any error in the original marking of a candidate's work.</P>
