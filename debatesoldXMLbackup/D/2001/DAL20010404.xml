      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Olivia Mitchell. I call on Deputy Mitchell to state the matter on which she has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter which is of serious, urgent national importance: the collapse in volume of national housing construction output, which is now running at 20% below target, especially in Dublin where need is greatest and where output has declined by 40%; the need for the Government to reverse policies which have caused such uncertainty in the market that they have inhibited rather than increased construction and the urgent need to resource the planning and appeals systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 25 &ndash; motion re Powers of sub-Committee on the Mini-CTC Signalling Project; No. 26 &ndash; motion re Powers of sub-Committee on the Abbeylara Incident; and No. 5 &ndash; Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.00 p.m. and Nos. 25 and 26 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' business shall be No. 115 &ndash; motion re Economic Effects of Foot and Mouth Disease (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's intentions on No. 5? The order <Col N="3" /> refers to the resumption of the debate. I presume there is no guillotine this evening. Will he also clarify if it is the Government's intention to proceed with all Stages of the Bill in the next week or so with a view to holding a referendum on 31 May?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>We object to this proposal. The Government is rushing through this legislation because it wants the least amount of debate possible. We also seek clarification on the role of the Referendum Commission. The Government does not want a debate on the Nice Treaty but we want both sides of the argument to be made. Publishing so called neutral literature &ndash; the condensed White Paper &ndash; is not enough for the Green Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Is the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. The next proposal is for dealing with Nos. 25 and 26 concerning the powers of sub-committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 25 we will support the powers that have been requested. We hope they will be granted and that the committee will have an expeditious and fruitful inquiry. I am worried about a number of leaks from the committee. The Public Accounts Committee conducted its inquiry into the DIRT difficulties without any leaks. The leaks from this committee may inhibit it from carrying out its functions to full effect. Does the Taoiseach have any observations on this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and most Members of the House would agree that the greatest risk of the spread of foot and mouth disease in this State is from the smuggling of sheep. The Taoiseach may be aware of a request under the Freedom of Information Act which established that an assistant principal in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development working in the sheep meat division reported in a memo dated November 1998 that farmers were furious with the lack of concern shown by the Department, which had done nothing, and that veterinary inspectors must be turning a blind eye to the consignments of lamb in question. On 13 October 1998 the Minister said the Department did not keep any records of sheep imported from Northern Ireland, yet a few months later, on 2 February 1999, he gave assurances to the House about sheep smuggling when he said he was not aware of any recent incident of illegally imported lambs into the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this should be investigated. I do not want to take from the great work done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and its officials in recent weeks, but it seems to me that they were very remiss when it was exposed in the media that there was widespread smuggling of sheep of UK origin into the jurisdiction, and that the assurances given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to this House did not reveal the full story. I put it to the Taoiseach that nothing was done except to refer the matter to the Revenue Commissioners and that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development sat on his hands. This has been the source of most of the grief this country has experienced in the past two months. Will the Taoiseach have this matter investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn may ask a brief supplementary question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Smugglers obviously have many friends in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt part of the problem we are experiencing at present has come about because of sheep smuggling but the closer co-operation between the authorities in Northern Ireland, and particularly the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development under Ms Bríd Rodgers, MLA, and the officials here opens up for the first time the possibility of considerably enhanced co-operation between North and South. In view of the responsibility which the Taoiseach's Department has for Northern Ireland, could I ask him to request an official from his Department, not the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to look at this in the context of an all-Ireland solution which would serve the interests of farmers North and South of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither we nor the Garda have information of an illegal movement of sheep since 21 February. If there is specific information about that, it should be given to the Garda immediately. They are heavy on the ground in that area and most of the special units of the Garda are in that particular area.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, as has been emphasised during the course of the many debates here over the past number of weeks, under EU veterinary legislation there is free movement without certification of sheep between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Many of the comments I have heard recently seem to have been made by people who seem to have forgotten that, but in 1998 and 1999, that was the position &ndash; free movement of sheep without certification of any kind was permitted between Northern Ireland and the Republic. That is what has been going on for a long number of years.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, there has been considerable legal movement of sheep across the Border in both directions. Recently I have heard many good arguments that this is not such a good idea put forward by all sides of the House but the fact is that traditionally that has been the practice and it has been legal to do so.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development became concerned that the VAT refund regulations were not being observed and asked the Revenue Commissioners to investigate that because the Department thought that the percentage VAT system in operation, which is indexed here every year on budget night, should be looked at. There was some concern that it might be a consideration for people and might explain why people would be involved in so many movements of animals. Some time later the Revenue Commissioners reported back that they had imposed heavy fines on two meat companies for VAT refund irregularities.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development also took action in the 1997-98 period to which Deputy Noonan is referring to increase vigilance at meat plants and to ensure that sheep from the United Kingdom were not slaughtered illegally in Ireland, and circulars were issued to inspectors at that time reminding them of the import requirements &ndash; these are some of the facts of which the Deputy spoke.</P>
      <P>The issue was taken up in the sheep forum where it was agreed that the most effective solution to the problem was sheep tagging. We know the difficulties involved there but that is water under the bridge. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has finally, after decades, managed to resolve that matter and I congratulate him for that because I know the difficulties involved in it. Agreement has now been reached with the farming organisations on the introduction of sheep tagging from a date in early May next, with traceability through to the carcass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's point, which is a good point, the excellent relationships which have been built up under the North-South bodies are <Col N="6" /> allowing for new developments. Of course the establishment of a single veterinary regime for the island would require agreement between the Government and the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland Assembly. A considerable amount of work has already been done under the aegis of the North/South ministerial body before any of this happened to seek possibilities for collaboration and co-operation in a range of animal health areas and this will continue.</P>
    <P>In the present foot and mouth situation, there are potential advantages to having a common veterinary regime. I would be strongly supportive of such a regime, assuming it would be possible to ensure that the controls equivalent to those operating between this jurisdiction and Great Britain, the Netherlands and France were also operating between Northern Ireland and those countries, otherwise it would not make much sense.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the question is extremely complex. It is not as easy as it seems. Any decision to establish a single veterinary regime on this island would require equivalent animal health status in both parts of the island, which is not the case at present. There is a considerable amount of equivalence at present, but the situation is complicated by the high incidence of BSE in the UK herd, which has meant that the exportation of livestock from Northern Ireland has been banned since March 1996.</P>
    <P>However, I am not against it and we should do anything we can on the North-South bodies to try and move it on. There is also an over 30 month regime operating in the UK where such bovine animals are excluded from the food chain. Therefore there are some obstacles to the establishment of a single veterinary regime but the Minister advises me that he and his colleagues are very anxious on the North-South body to try and press on and do as much as they can in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given the House a great deal of information but the principal item of information he has put on the record is not correct. It is not correct to say that there was free movement of sheep from Northern Ireland to the Republic and that it was quite legal to do so. There was free movement of sheep of Northern Ireland origin to the Republic, which is entirely different. The sheep which were being smuggled for the purposes of evading VAT did not originate in Northern Ireland. They came from Great Britain and many of them were purchased in exactly the same market in Carlisle which has been instrumental in spreading foot and mouth disease to Northern Ireland. It was those sheep which were the concern of the official in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development when she wrote a memo stating that the Department has clearly done nothing and has turned a blind eye.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again draw Deputy Noonan's attention to the central element of this, that under the EU veterinary legislation there is free movement without certification of sheep between Northern Ireland and the Republic. On the other side of it and in the context of the cur<Col N="8" /> rent position as regards the foot and mouth situation, in replying to Deputy Quinn that there were advantages to a common veterinary regime, I said, &ldquo;assuming that it would be possible to ensure that the controls equivalent to those operating between this jurisdiction and Great Britain, the Netherlands and France were also operating between Northern Ireland and those countries&rdquo;, because people in Northern Ireland can move sheep between these countries. That is the difficulty. There is also the movement of sheep within the islands. It is legal for Northern Ireland to trade with those countries and with us.</P>
      <P>On the other side there is the Carlisle situation. From the information we have to hand &ndash; and I am sure these matters will be subject to investigations &ndash;  it appears the two confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease on this island to date were the result of smuggling. I am sure the Garda investigations will finalise that, but that movement was before 21 February, the date we closed things down. I have said inside and outside the House what I think of smuggling and the other malpractices that seem to be a culture that has developed. We still have quite an amount of work to do in that area and we will have to do it. The Garda has been updating for the past four or five weeks what I am sure is a long litany of facts they have gathered on these matters and I hope they can proceed to prosecution with them and also reach conclusions on how we might tighten up matters for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a report in one of today's newspaper summarising the recommendations of the Flynn report on the future of the post office system. There is also a statement attributed to a spokesperson on behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise to the effect that an announcement will be made fairly soon about the future of the banking arrangements and the post offices. I am aware that the Taoiseach's Department was briefed some time back by representatives of the banking federation about the introduction of a single universal bank account. In light of the uncertainty that hangs over the immediate future of the viability of the post office network countrywide and the desirability to ensure that every citizen is properly integrated into a system of financial transfers, will the Taoiseach indicate what the current position is, the substance to the report attributed to the spokesperson on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and when he will make an announcement on the introduction of a universal bank account that would help, in part, to secure the future of some but not all of the post offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report. Phil Flynn has done an amount of work on this area over a period of time. He has gone over the history of the post office system, the 1,800 branches throughout the country, back to the foundation of the State. A number of difficulties with the post office network are outlined in the report. As <Col N="9" /> to what will happen now, there will be no delay in establishing an interdepartmental group who will work on the report. A number of issues highlighted in the report must be implemented forthwith.</P>
      <P>Given that commercial banks have pulled out of various areas, the Minister is anxious that the post office network should be in a position to take up as much of that work as possible and serve the community as best they can. She has almost concluded negotiations with the banks on arrangements to ensure they will have an involvement in this. I am not sure what date she will announce those proposals, but it will be shortly as they are nearly concluded.</P>
      <P>The Government considers the post office network as extremely important. Far from creating any uncertainty, we are anxious to make sure that as much business, including new and different types of business, can be given to them so that we can make them viable for the future . Some of them will close as some of them will not renew their licences, but it is our wish that the network stays in place and we want to ensure it will be viable. Apart from the issue of postmasters and postmistresses requiring pay increases given their low incomes, it is also essential to ensure they are given new areas of business. Where banking services have been pulled out of not only rural areas but urban areas, the Minister is of the view that some of those services should be passed to the post office service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Flynn report, is it the Government's intention to announce the widespread closure of post offices around the country? Will that be done by the Government? At what stage can we expect that announcement? In the meantime has the Government any proposal to reopen the 80 or so post offices where those operating them are finding it difficult to get people to take over the duties of postmaster or postmistress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused about the Taoiseach's reply. This report has been referred to an indepartmental committee. The post offices and the Exchequer are facing a bill of approximately £82 million by the year 2003, yet the Minister for Public Enterprise is about to announce proposals on one aspect of new business fairly soon. I suggest that report and the announcements when made by the Minister should be referred to a relevant committee of this House because of the widespread concern people have about the future of the post office network. The proposal to refer the report to an interdepartmental committee and that the Minister is about to make an announcement on one aspect of business seems to indicate that the Government is moving in two different directions on this matter at the one time. The matter should be referred to a relevant committee of these Houses to facilitate a proper discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that suggestion. I will reply to two questions put. Some issues are more urgent than others. As Deputy Quinn correctly said when he spoke first on the matter, the discussions between the banking group and the committee it has set up and the Government have been going on for a long time. Since then banking services in many parts of the country, rural and urban, have been pulled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And more will pull out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>More will pull out. In those areas not alone does it not make sense to close the post offices but it makes good sense to develop them and to give them the technological advances to enable them not only to do their existing work but to do much of the banking work that was done by the commercial banks in the past and to benefit from any other new experience the State can give them. That is our intention.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Noonan's question, I do not envisage branches of banks that were closed because nobody wanted to take up the business as they were not viable, being reopened. Equally, I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy that he will not see the wholesale closure of post offices throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is worth our while to have a look at the Nice Treaty before we deal with some of its critics. The purpose of the Treaty of Nice is to complete the programme of institutional reform which was designed to prepare the European Union for significant expansion in its membership. In this regard it is worth reminding ourselves that the institutional arrangements on which the European Community is based are largely the same as those put in place in 1950 when the ECSE was first proposed. It is timely, therefore, to upgrade and examine the continued efficacy of those institutions. The Nice treaty continues the process which began in the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty. The main element of the Nice treaty is a range of changes across the EU institutions.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Nice treaty was set in Helsinki in December 1999 when it was decided that the intergovernmental conference would deal with three specific and fundamental issues, namely, the size and composition of the Commission, voting within the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council. This has been a thorny issue in the side of the EU from the time the original six member states were moving from the first to the second stage of integration and when the Luxembourg Accord was necessary to paper over cracks which appeared at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the negotiations which lead to the Nice treaty the future size and composition of the Commission became a primary focus for member states. It is worth our while recording exactly the role of the Commission. There is a complete and indeed mendacious representation on the part of those currently leading the charge against the treaty, for example, Deputy Gormley of the Green Party, on the role and function of the Commission of the EU. The Commission serves as guardian of the treaties, is the exponent of the Union interest, the executive arm of the Union, the administrator and controller of var<Col N="16" /> ious Union funds and the initiator of Union policies. It is not the role of the Commission to represent the interests of member states. Specifically, the Commission is charged with the task of representing the Union interest. The changes in the Commission, therefore, are of no significance whatsoever in terms of representing the interests of individual member states, and to suggest as some of the critics on the national platform are doing that somehow the changes will have an impact on this nation is utter nonsense. It is worth reminding ourselves that when members are appointed to the Commission, commissioners give an undertaking or oath effectively saying they will not be guided or instructed by any member Government or any other institution and that their primary concern must be for the Union.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the changes being effected in the Nice treaty are not as earth-shattering as they have been portrayed. It was eventually agreed in Nice that from 2005, the date of the appointment of the next Commission, the five large states will forego their current right to nominate a second member to the Commission. This has been put forward and advocated for some time by pro-European observers such as myself as a way of overcoming some of the difficulties in the growing size of the Commission. Each member state will nominate one commissioner to the Commission until the Union has 27 member states. Only then will the Council decide by unanimity on the size and scope of the next Commission. Therefore, it is not the end of the world in terms of an Irish nominee on the Commission. The changes mean each member state, including the newly admitted members, will nominate one member to the Commission until the Union has 27 members.</P>
    <P>The doom sayers have also drawn attention to the fact that there are changes in the Nice Treaty relating to the presidency of the Commission. Changes in the role of the presidency have been ongoing since the time of the Single European Act. The role of the president has necessarily grown and developed over the past ten to 15 years because the Union has become a far more significant place, the Commission has become much bigger, the role the Union is playing in the lives of all citizens of member states is greater and there is a need for more coherence and co-ordination and a more focused approach.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty will increase the powers of the presidency of the Commission, which was also a feature of the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty. The president will have authority to decide on the internal organisation of the Commission, to allocate tasks among Commission members, to appoint vice-presidents with the approval of the Commission, and subject to the approval of the Commission require a member of the Commission to resign. These roles which are now being explicitly being given to the president of the Commission are not new &ndash; he has effectively fulfilled them to date. The idea that the president of the Commission can require a mem<Col N="17" /> ber to resign with the approval of the Commission can hardly be portrayed as a novel or revolutionary move forward, particularly given the difficulties which existed in the Santer Commission. Such provision makes good common sense.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the reweighting of votes which again has been portrayed as threatening or a disaster or potential disaster for Ireland. The reality is that the redistribution of the weighting of votes and the enhancement of qualified majority voting is not a threat in any sense to this State. Post-January 2005, Germany, France and Italy will have 29 votes, Spain will have 27 votes, the Netherlands will have 13 votes, Greece, Belgium and Portugal will have 12 votes, Sweden and Austria will have ten votes, Denmark, Finland and Ireland will have seven votes and Luxembourg will have four votes, a total of 237 votes. It is agreed in the treaty that from 2005 to adopt a decision of the Union of the 15 it will be necessary to secure 169 of the 237 votes, which is 71.31% of votes. The current qualified majority is 71.26%, so if we are to be pedantic, the reality is the voting powers of countries such as Ireland is marginally improved and is certainly not disimproved.</P>
    <P>Ireland will ultimately have seven out of 345 votes in a Union of 27, the equivalent of 2.03% of the total voting strength of the Council. It is worth reminding ourselves that our proportion of the population of a Union of 27 is 0.8%, so we are hardly being hard done by. Qualified majority voting in a series of technical areas does not threaten the sovereignty of this or any other member state. It has been an issue in the EU since the very first stage of integration. At the end of the first stage of integration, from the Treaty of Rome, it was necessary to move to a situation where more qualified majority voting was used. There were difficulties with the French at the time, and it was patched over by the Luxembourg Accord, which has been misrepresented since as a ministerial veto in the Council. It was misrepresented here last night by the Green Party, <i>quelle surprise</i>. Following implementation of the Nice treaty, qualified majority voting will be expanded to a number of specific areas, none of which threatens sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The other issue concerning critics is that of enhanced co-operation and the changes in the size of the European Parliament. Enhanced co-operation has been established within the Union for some time, and what we see in the Nice treaty is a more structured basis on which that can happen in future. The treaty also sets out specific areas to which it can and cannot relate. Other institutional changes include changes in membership of the European Parliament. We will lose three members in the Parliament. It currently has a membership of 626, and is maximised under the Amsterdam Treaty at 700 members. Our 15 members, who do not sit in a national group in any sense, depend for their influence on their personal capacities &ndash; some of them represent us <Col N="18" /> very well and others do not &ndash; and on their membership of committees and groups. That will not really change as a result of reducing the figure from 15 to 12 in a 723 member Parliament. It may have an effect on some people here who have aspirations to be elected to the Parliament, but that is the only effect it will have.</P>
    <P>I will address one or two of the arguments put forward, in particular by the National Platform. The National Platform decided that we would engage in a federation of the <i>avant garde. </i>It referred to something Joschka Fischer and Jacques Delors said. It is very selective in its quotations. It argues that even by joining the euro with Northern Ireland staying in the sterling area, we have added a new dimension to partition. It suggests that particular treaty will further partition this island. This is a truly bizarre argument. It seems we should halt the onward march of the European Union because the authorities that govern in that part of the island have adopted a head in the sand attitude to the euro. That is what the National Platform members suggest. Talk about a piece of post-colonial self-consciousness. It is utterly bizarre that serious-minded people would put forward that type of argument on an issue of some importance to this nation.</P>
    <P>The second issue which they have put forward is that there is somehow or other a threat to fundamental rights, because the fundamental rights charter will be incorporated into European law. They make the allegation that somehow or other the Supreme Court will lose out to the European Court of Justice and to the Court of First Instance. This is a total misrepresentation of the role of those courts and more to the point, it is a total misrepresentation and a mendacious representation of the history of those courts. The European Court of Justice has added very considerably over the past 20 years to our understanding of the economic human rights of the individual. To suggest that there is a threat to fundamental human rights is bizarre.</P>
    <P>Militarisation is another issue which is trotted out for argument. This argument has been going on since 1972 and the sky has not yet fallen. If I had more time I would speak at greater length about the decisions which I regret were made about the Western European Union. What we have here from the doom sayers and the nay sayers is a reiteration of all the old arguments, the Chicken Licken arguments which say that the sky will fall if we adopt this treaty. Nothing of the sort will happen. We will simply be reasserting that we are now a self-confident democracy.</P>

    <P>Each of these treaties has been crucial to the development of the process of European unity. <Col N="19" /> The Oireachtas, and the Irish people, have strongly voted for the legislative and constitutional changes necessary to allow these treaties to come into effect. In so doing, both the Oireachtas and the people have seen clearly where Ireland's best a interests lie. As a result of past treaties, Ireland is now a prosperous member of the most powerful trading bloc in the world with a Single Market of 375 million people and a single currency.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is no less crucial than any of its predecessors. It is another stage in the European Union's development process. It will prepare the Union for its further enlargement to include ten applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe as well as Cyprus, Malta and, later, Turkey. The accession of the twelve Central and East European and Mediterranean countries will add more than 100 million people to the Union's population and increase its land area by one-third. While this development will take place over a period of years in a phased way, the absorption of such a huge addition to the Union's population and land area, with all the diversity &ndash; economic, social and cultural &ndash; that is involved, will be a major challenge.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice prepares for that challenge. It is designed specifically to ensure that the enlarged Union will continue to function in the interests of all its citizens, both existing and prospective. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has explained the changes in the Union's institutions and decision-making procedures enshrined in the treaty and I do not propose to go into them again. I emphasise their importance for Ireland's interests. Ireland has benefited enormously from membership, right from the beginning in 1973. The benefits have been widespread throughout the economy. The social and cultural benefits have also been considerable. However, I will concentrate on the benefits to the agriculture and food industries and to rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the 28 years from 1973 to 2000, Ireland has received almost £22 billion in price supports, including direct payments, from the guarantee section of the European Agricultural Fund. In addition, our farmers have benefited from receiving higher prices for their exports to the highly supported Union market. All of these benefits have enhanced farmers' incomes and transformed their living standards in line with those of the rest of society. The consequences are obvious throughout rural Ireland. They take various forms such as new houses, refurbished houses, increased car ownership, increased general purchasing power, and the full participation by farmers in the life of local communities.</P>
    <P>In addition to these benefits in the form of price supports, agriculture, the food industry and rural areas have all benefited from receipts from the guidance or structural section of the European Agricultural Fund. These benefits have amounted to £2 billion over the 28 years since our accession. These structural moneys have lever<Col N="20" /> aged matching funds from the Exchequer and, together with the contribution of the beneficiaries, amount to a massive investment in agricultural, food industry and rural structures. Our farms have been modernised and have been made more productive and there has been major investment in anti-pollution and hygiene measures. There has therefore been benefit not only to the farmers in the form of higher productivity, but to the general public in the form of a better environment and higher levels of food safety.</P>
    <P>Our food industry has made a major leap into value-added and consumer-ready production with assistance from these structural moneys. These moneys, together with matching Exchequer funds and contributions from the industry itself, have enabled major capital investment in plant to be made and have assisted research and development, training, marketing and promotion. There is no doubt that the level of investment, particularly in research and development, training and marketing and promotion, would not have been as high without the assistance available from the European Union.</P>
    <P>The development of the food industry which this investment has permitted has underpinned farmers' incomes by providing remunerative outlets for their products, has contributed massively to our balance of trade because of the high domestically-produced content of food exports, and has generated considerable additional employment throughout rural Ireland because of the food industry's extensive regional spread.</P>
    <P>Rural areas have benefited directly from Structural Funds also. There are hundreds of small development projects throughout the country which have started because of Structural Funds assistance. Perhaps more important than the benefits which flowed from the projects is the confidence that initiatives like Leader have given to rural people. There are many rural areas which were depressed for generations, where the people had become despondent, even hopeless, about the future. Leader gave these people not just funding but some measure of control over their own futures. The change of attitude, from near despair to confidence, has been one of the hallmarks of a rapidly developing rural Ireland over the past decade or so.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the benefits of EU membership for the Irish agriculture and food industries and for rural development, have been enormous. These benefits have happened because the EU institutions function well. They allow the voice of a small country to be heard and its interests taken into account. They also allow for decisions on the running of the Union and on the formulation of Union policy to be taken at reasonable speed. It is in Ireland's interests that this process continues in an enlarged Union. The institutional changes and changes in decision-making procedures in the Treaty of Nice are designed to protect this process and that is why I believe the Oireachtas should approve the legislation now, and later, the <Col N="21" /> people should strongly endorse the changes by referendum.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the future of the Common Agricultural Policy in an enlarged Union. Many people may be concerned that the CAP will be altered fundamentally by enlargement. The accession negotiations which are being conducted with the applicant countries are about how those countries will apply the CAP as it stands. The end result will be that the vast bulk of existing agricultural policies will apply to the new member states from the respective dates of their accession, with transitional periods allowed for difficulties where some time is needed. The one exception where there cannot be any deviation from the strict application of EU standards from the beginning, is the crucial area of food safety. In other words, the new member states will apply the CAP, the CAP will not be adjusted to the new member states.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that there will not be further adjustments to the CAP. It has already been the subject of a series of reforms to bring it into line with changing internal and external circumstances. It is unrealistic to expect a policy instrument of such magnitude to stand still. What is important is that any adjustments are sensible and properly balanced, and that the overall vision and philosophy of the policy is one to which we can subscribe. We have been able to defend successfully our position and views in the past, and I have no reason to believe that we will not be able to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>In considering the direct effects of enlargement on the agriculture and food industries, the enlargement of the single market is of major significance. The enlarged EU will have more than 100 million additional consumers. This is a clear opportunity for a country like Ireland which has to export so much of its food production. I look forward to enlargement and see it as an opportunity rather than a threat. It will bring many opportunities not only for the agricultural and food industries but for the country as a whole. However, these opportunities, and the existing benefits which we enjoy from membership, can be assured only if we adapt the European Union's institutions to the new situation. This is what the Treaty of Nice is about and why I urge the House to approve the draft legislation now before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has said, and while some might disagree, there are now fewer people living in rural Ireland, fewer in farming and many dissatisfied with legislation from Europe. They feel that if this legislation from Europe continues there will be even fewer in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his Department on the handling of the foot and mouth disease crisis. Action was slow in the first week but the Minister got his act together and has done a good job. Deputy Walsh has probably been the most unlucky Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development ever to hold that office. However, <Col N="22" /> people do not realise he is probably the longest serving Minister for Agriculture &ndash; I think he has been in that Department for 17 years. The officials in that Department know his form by now. The Minister was unlucky with BSE, which occurred when the sheep and cattle markets were depressed, but he has done a fine job during the foot and mouth disease crisis. He has received support from all sides of the House on what is a national issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should tell the Government that this referendum should be called off due to the foot and mouth disease threat. It could be held with the general election later in the year or next year. The Taoiseach has always said the election will be next June and that is a proper time frame for discussion on the treaty. The Nice Treaty is being pushed through this House and pushed at the people. There is not enough discussion on it.</P>
    <P>There was a time when it was possible to express a different view without being categorised. That is gone now. Everyone must sing from the same hymn sheet or be considered wrong. This is a democracy, a free country, and people should be able to express a view whether for or against. The media and the political parties should not categorise people who should be able to openly express their views. That is what I intend this morning. I will ask questions and say what I believe although this may not reflect my party's policy. I was elected by the people and will represent them.</P>
    <P>EU Commissioners currently are not elected and some have failed to be elected. In some cases, Governments picked Commissioners to remove unwanted politicians from domestic politics. Yet, these people form legislation in Europe for the people of both Ireland and Europe. This worries me and I agree with the Green Party position in this debate, although I do not often agree with that party. It seems likely that we will have a European Prime Minister and a European Government at some point in the future. The Government may not agree with me.</P>
    <P>There are 166 TDs yet this House is nothing more than a talking shop. The urban councils and Leader boards have more power than this House because all legislation is coming from Europe. If I asked a question of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in this House he would probably give me two answers. The first would be no answer at all and the second would be to say that he is governed by EU legislation on the matter under discussion. He would say that we have to implement policy as EU legislation demands.</P>
    <P>For what are Members elected to this House? Those who died for Ireland in 1916, 1921 and 1922, including my grandfather, would turn in their graves if they saw how we are handing over our powers to Europe. All legislation is determined in Europe, some good and some bad. Some is not suitable for Ireland, yet we are tied into it. I am worried about possible future legis<Col N="23" /> lation and worried that people will not know what they are voting for in the Nice Treaty referendum. The Minister may say to the House following the referendum that this is what the people voted for, but they may not have known what they voted for. This referendum should be postponed until the general election, which the Taoiseach insists will be held next year.</P>
    <P>The people should know what they are voting for and why this referendum is necessary. They should be fully informed on all future legislation whether it concerns abortion, a European army, or other matters. The Government is pushing this matter through the Dáil due to Ms Patricia McKenna's High Court action. She did not do the people any favours with that High Court action on referendum information. Previously, it was easy to distinguish those for and against a referendum topic. Ms McKenna's case has damaged democracy. Money should be provided for both sides to make their case to help voters decide. The way this referendum has been pushed on the people is worrying, especially as correct information is not being supplied.</P>
    <P>We first had the Common Market and then the EEC, before the EU came into being. Members of this House will tell voters what they want to hear while not telling voters what has been agreed in this treaty. For example, during the referendum campaign on entry to the Common Market, the big selling point for voters was that an Irish person could go to any part of Europe and buy what they wanted. There would be no borders or barriers, just the Common Market. Any person could go to any member country and buy a foreign car &ndash; perhaps a Passat, a BMW or even a Mercedes &ndash; and then bring that car back to Ireland without paying extra tax or duty. That did not happen. The Common Market had been the big selling point of that referendum yet it never happened. People must pay to Customs and Excise the difference between what the car costs in the other country and here. They must pay two taxes &ndash; the ordinary tax and an extended tax. VAT must also be paid and that is outrageous. We are either in the Common Market or not.</P>
    <P>We are discussing enlargement. We want to enlarge the EU to 28 countries. That enlargement should not go ahead until the existing EU members begin to take part in the Common Market. How can anyone in Europe justify bringing in a new currency in January, 2001, while customers travelling to Britain will have to change their money to sterling? That is not a Common Market. That is not what we signed up to. People were told that all member states would obey the same laws. How can the EU be enlarged when current members cannot agree to implement the regulations as they are? This is wrong and should not be tolerated. Britain must decide whether it is a member of the European Union and should not be allowed to opt out of the common currency or other measures which it does not like. Much European legislation has been presented to <Col N="24" /> the Oireachtas which the people, including myself, did not like, but like good Europeans we accepted it and have played our part in Europe. Britain must decide whether it is part of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland should play its part in the army of the European Union. We cannot allow other countries to fight our wars and protect our country. We cannot have people from Britain, Belgium and France protecting our shores while we preserve our neutrality. If we are part of the European Union, we must take the good with the bad. We cannot accept agricultural and other subsidies while not paying a price for them. We must play our part.</P>
    <P>What has become of the free market we were promised many years ago? Why can an Irish person not take a car from any country in Europe into Ireland without paying extra VAT and other taxes? Are European markets open or not? When will an Irish citizen be liable to pay the same taxes as a citizen of any other European country?</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has come across the problems of holders of UK pensions in his constituency. This issue has concerned me for many years. Many left Ireland in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and sent money home to their families from Britain and other countries. This money helped to build the economy. When we did not have the support of the European Union we depended on emigrants' remittances. Emigrants put money into Irish banks and bread on many Irish tables. Irish citizens who are entitled to British pensions receive prompt and excellent service from the UK pensions service in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Successive Irish Governments, on the other hand, placed every possible obstacle in the way of those who sought their entitlements. It is only in the recent past that this attitude has changed. Those whose pensions are made up partly of Irish and partly of British payments lost out when the Irish pound was stronger than sterling. At that time the Irish Government did nothing to help them. However, when sterling became stronger than the Irish pound the beavers from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs reduced their Irish pensions to allow for the strength of sterling. Was that a nice thank you for those had to leave this country and kept it going by sending money home? The Government should examine the matter. Many are upset by it and are waiting for a Government politician to call to their doors, whether to canvass for the Nice referendum or a general election.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to give the people all the information they need to make up their minds on this constitutional amendment. The people should be told the contents of the Nice Treaty and what they are voting for, rather than have the spin doctors of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and other political parties tell them the treaty is the greatest thing that ever happened. The people should be told the truth. They <Col N="25" /> should be told what future legislation will be affected by the treaty. This is not happening. People are being criticised because they hold different views. They have a right to hold different views, question legislation and ask what will happen in the future. No one should be criticised for asking questions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and EU Heads of Government met recently, but we do not know what they agreed. Because of the McKenna judgment we are not being given all the information. The contents of the treaty and its future effects on the country and legislation should be spelt out clearly. If abortion legislation or a future EU army is to follow from the Treaty of Nice we should be aware of this before we vote. The people have always voted wisely. They have never been afraid to make a decision. We know the benefits and disadvantages of Europe. However, people are afraid of a hidden agenda. If the Government and the Opposition parties which have supported the Nice Treaty tell the people exactly what is involved, they will receive a positive response. While some European legislation is good, some is bad or unsuitable for Ireland. I hope the people will vote wisely in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The referendum should not be held on 31 May. Foot and mouth disease is a serious issue and we should not take chances with regard to it. The referendum should be held on the same day as the general election. The Taoiseach said that the general election will not take place until next year. I will be ready to fight it whenever it is held. However, the referendum should be held in conjunction with it. I have received many letters from people who are concerned that they have not received sufficient information about the Nice Treaty. Central government appears to be telling us that everything is fine and that we should do what it tells us. I believe in Europe, but I respect those who hold the opposite view. People become afraid when they are not given complete information. The Government should give people the full facts and spend whatever money is necessary to do so. The people are wise and can be trusted to make the correct decision. The referendum should be postponed for at least 12 months in order that we can have an open and honest debate on the subject. People should know what they are voting for in order that if unpopular legislation is introduced in two or three years time, they cannot be told that they voted for it in the Nice referendum. We must know what we are voting for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratification of the Nice Treaty is an extremely important exercise for Ireland and the overall development of the European Union. The <Col N="26" /> details of the treaty were agreed by EU leaders on 12 December 2000 in the French resort of Nice and the treaty was signed by EU Foreign Ministers on 26 February 2001. EU Governments have now signed this treaty and it is incumbent on all of us to ensure it is ratified.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some preliminary remarks about the importance of ratifying this treaty and analysing Ireland's present relationship within the overall context of the European Union. The Berlin Wall collapsed in 1990 and communism as the means of governance in eastern and central Europe came to an end in that year. New democratic governments have been set up in eastern and central Europe and since that date they have been seeking to join as full members of the European Union. Accession to the European Union is a difficult exercise. Accession negotiations are broken up into more than 30 different rounds of discussions covering all key economic and social sectors of activity.</P>
    <P>Before any enlargement of the European Union can take place, a number of key changes must be put in place before any new member state can become a full member of the EU. The enlargement negotiations must be concluded and there are still a number of difficult chapters of discussions which have yet to be concluded between the European Union and prospective new members. Difficult chapters of discussions include the agricultural round of talks, consumer health, environmental issues and the implementation of social legislation in eastern and central Europe, just to name a few. However, from the perspective of the existing member states, the decision making procedures within key EU institutions must change before any enlargement of the European Union can take place. The European Economic Community was founded in 1957 with six original members. Decision making procedures within the European Commission and within the European Council which represents the 15 Governments of the EU were decided on at that stage.</P>
    <P>In 1973, Ireland, Britain and Denmark became full members of the European Economic Community bringing the membership of the EEC to nine. Greece became a full member in 1981, Spain and Portugal became full members in 1986 and Sweden, Austria and Finland became full members of the now European Union in 1995, bringing the existing and total EU membership to 15 member states. Decision making procedures which had been originally agreed in 1957 and altered in part via the Single European Act in 1987 were still the order of the day with regard to the implementation of new directives and regulations within the EU. This situation cannot continue in a European Community that will have up to 27 member states over the next ten to 12 years. It is incumbent on the Governments of the European Union and the decision makers within key EU institutions to reform their internal procedures so that decisions can be taken in the European Union in a more streamlined and structured man<Col N="27" /> ner. The deal secured at Nice by the Taoiseach is a very balanced one. It will ensure the enlargement of the European Union can take place once the provisions of the Nice Treaty are ratified across the territories of the 15 member states of the European Union. Equally, the interests of smaller member states have been fully protected within an evolving and changing European Union in which we now live.</P>
    <P>From 2005, when the next European Commission comes into office, the five largest states will forego their right to nominate a second member of the European Commission. Each member state from that date will nominate one member to the European Commission until the European Union reaches 27 members, at which point the Council will decide unanimously on a size for the Commission of less than the number of member states. Membership of the European Commission will then be based on strict equal rotation among the member states. The powers of the President of the European Commission, including the power to request the resignation of a commissioner have been augmented. It is important that Ireland retains its right to nominate a member of the European Commission because the European Commission is still the body within the EU which initiates all EU legislation. The European Commission is also the institution which controls the administration of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Transport Policy and EU competition affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a European Union that is simply dominated by larger member states alone. The prospective reform of the European Commission will ensure smaller member states still play a key and central role in the decision making process within this institution. This is an excellent achievement which has been secured by the Taoiseach and one which I hope will be supported by the Irish people when this matter is put to a referendum. Also in 2005, as anticipated in the Amsterdam Treaty which was ratified by the Irish people, there will be a re-weighting of votes within the European Council. This is to compensate those states who are giving up their second commissioner which includes Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain. It is also agreed that decisions taken by qualified majority must have the support of at least half of the EU member states. On request, decisions will also require the support of at least 62% of the European Union's total population. Ireland will continue to have the same voting weight as Finland and Denmark.</P>
    <P>All decisions within the European Union cannot be taken by unanimity. If this was the case, one member state that may be unhappy or dissatisfied with certain legislation can hold up the enactment of such legislation across all the territories of the European Union. We live in a European Union of more than 370 million citizens. Post-future enlargements of the EU, this population is set to increase to more than 550 million. <Col N="28" /> Decision making procedures must be fair and balanced. Reform of the decision making procedures within the European Commission and within the European Council are balanced and will also protect the interests of smaller member states. The European Union has made excellent progress, particularly in the past 15 years. The enactment of the Single European Act in 1986 and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Amsterdam Treaty in 1998 have all reformed decision making procedures within the European Union which is making the EU more efficient. The ratification of the Nice Treaty will, in turn, make the European Union even more efficient in the manner in which it takes decisions.</P>
    <P>Thirty new areas of economic and social policies will also move from the unanimity requirement which I referred to earlier as a decision making process to the system of qualified majority voting. This will help improve decision making procedures within the European Council and new changes in this regard include important areas such as international agreements and services and trade related aspects of intellectual property, the nomination of President of the European Commission, the implementation of Structural funds after 2007, and certain EMU articles.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I wish to mention one small matter. Taxation issues into the future will be decided by individual member states. This is an important concession particularly to the Irish Government and to other member states because matters of taxation whether of a local or national level should be decided by individual member states alone. If Ireland lost the right to decide on its own internal taxation matters, in the medium to longer term, that would result in higher taxation for taxpayers. This will not now be the case as a result of the enactment of the new provisions in the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Nice Treaty greatly enhances the social rights of the citizens of the European Union. New changes envisaged under the treaty in this important area of social affairs include an extension of powers to EU Governments and to the European Parliament to do away with anti-discrimination measures in the workplace; new proposals will be brought forward to promote the modernisation of social protection and social insurance schemes within the European Union; greater power will be given to the European Union to combat social exclusion and to protect workers when their employment contracts are terminated; conditions of employment for third country nationals legally residing within the European Union will be updated; a new social protection committee will be set up in the European Union to promote co-operation between member states; and a new EU charter on fundamental rights will also be put in place. This is the first time the European Union has brought together in a single comprehensive document the civil, political, economic and social <Col N="29" /> rights and freedoms to which the citizens of the Union are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Irish people should not be afraid of enlargement of the European Union. The opposite should be the case. Ireland is an exporting country and enlargement of the Union will provide more markets for our goods and services and will help build a more peaceful European continent. It will also help to consolidate the building of new democracies and civil societies in eastern and central Europe. There will also be greater co-operation among the 15 member states of the European Union to combat organised crime through a new body to be called the European judicial co-operation unit.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited enormously from membership of the European Union since it joined in 1973. At that time our average <i>per capita</i> income was 55% of the EEC norm. This figure has now risen to a point where Ireland is one of the EU's wealthiest member states. The widespread implementation of EU Structural Funds programmes, particularly since 1987, has ensured the building of new infrastructures and the modernisation of our educational training systems. These developments have guaranteed our competitiveness within the Internal Market and the euro zone.</P>
    <P>As an exporting country with a GNP of almost £70 billion, we need to ensure market penetration in existing and new markets where no import duties exist. Equally we are implementing proposals at national and European levels to guarantee that priority assistance is given to the less well off in our communities and to areas which have not built the necessary infrastructures to attract new investment.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been of tremendous importance to the development of our economy. In <i>per capita</i> terms, agriculture is more important to Ireland than to any other EU member state. This has become particularly self-evident from the stringent and important measures which the Government has implemented in recent weeks to restrict and defeat the spread of foot and mouth disease. I compliment all involved in the implementation of these measures. Important new agricultural initiatives to be implemented over the next seven years include the early farm retirement scheme, the dairy hygiene programme, the rural environment protection scheme, the young farmer installation aid programme and re-afforestation measures.</P>
    <P>Ireland has contributed to the development of the European Union. We have a positive foreign policy which seeks to assist the United Nations in carrying out humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world. We also have a strong Third World development programme which is structured to help the poorest countries combat absolute poverty. In addition, we are continually promoting these important political causes within the overall framework of the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> As the European Union integrates more closely, it is also important that we protect cultural and linguistic diversities within the context of an ever-changing Union. That is why I welcome the fact that this year is the European Year for Languages which seeks to recognise all languages, whether minority, official or otherwise. Commitments to public broadcasting which protect lesser used languages are also an important element of this process.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty is a good deal for Ireland and the European Union. Ireland's future rests as an active member of the European Union and we must ensure this is the case for many years to come. We must also ensure the provisions of the Nice Treaty are ratified by our people so we all benefit from these new provisions and the proposals to be brought forward once the Nice Treaty is ratified by the 15 member states of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit to being a European federalist but the movement towards that goal in the Nice Treaty is not what I would have wished for. However, I am a realist and recognise that the structures and mindsets built up over centuries will take many years to disappear and that federalists in particular have to be patient.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Nice represents another step on the road towards a larger EU which could incorporate more than 30 countries in 15 or 20 years. Some commentators have described the issues discussed at Nice as &ldquo;leftovers&rdquo;. However, they were not just leftovers from earlier reforms but unresolved questions of power and parity in European policy. One astute observer noted that, for the first time in many years, the principles governing how countries and their citizens are represented were up for renegotiation and that an understanding was reached only as a result of the pressure arising from the imminent accession of the new member states.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that it was difficult to reach agreement. All politics worth its salt is about power and few matters are of more fundamental concern to nation states, governments, politicians and bureaucrats than the institutions through which power is wielded &ndash; the number of players, who will participate in the power stakes, the way in which votes will be calculated and where the power pressure points will be located. The stuff of politics, power and these issues were matters of concern and debate at Nice and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Nice summit was to bring to a conclusion the process of preparing the Union for the accession of a significant number of new member states. The summit was an undoubted success in that, subject to ratification by each member state, the Union will be in a position to admit those new states which are ready from the end of 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an idealist as regards Europe. The EU has made an enormous contribution to world peace. The two world wars in the first half of the last century were deplorable and awful but Europe <Col N="31" /> learned lessons from them. The sovereignty of areas such as Alsace and Lorraine were disputed for centuries. Almost every acre of such areas was stained in blood over the centuries. However, Alsace and Lorraine are now at peace and their futures are decided. The rest of the world can learn lessons from Europe.</P>
    <P>Europe has also made a contribution to peace in Northern Ireland. The precedents set by Europe can be used by politicians who wish to bring about a peaceful solution. The models provided by Europe as it proceeded towards its current state are of great use to people working towards peace in Northern Ireland. Europe also provided practical help which gave an impetus to the solving of problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That Britain and Ireland could meet as equals in EU Councils and on the margins of the Union to discuss the problems of Northern Ireland was particularly valuable. On occasions the EU provided an excuse for political leaders taking steps they wished to take but found difficulty doing so because of opposition from some quarters.</P>
    <P>Some of the countries which, following Nice, will now be able to join the EU have had anything but nice histories &ndash; countries like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Many of them suffered under communism and some of them suffered under Hitler and Nazism as well. Some of these countries are ones in which democratic institutions are a relatively new fragile plant and whose democratic future will be ensured and guaranteed inside the EU. The people and the Governments of and public opinion in those countries have welcomed Nice and I understand why they have done so.</P>
    <P>I was in Berlin in the Soviet sector and in Poland shortly after the wall came down. I have some memories which will never leave me, of the poverty of the people at that time. An abiding memory is of concrete apartments, concrete roads and of grey concrete everywhere &ndash; a symbol of the sort of regime they were just leaving. I remember seeing three men building a house. I counted five types of brick in one wall of that house. It was obvious that they saw the use of this brick, which they clearly had some difficulty obtaining, as a symbol of the new order. I remember thinking how welcome a load of good Tyrone rustic brick would have been to those people. The wall with five different types and five different colours of brick was a symbol of the new order as far as they were concerned.</P>
    <P>There are those who do not want enlargement, who are opposed to this treaty, who tell us it is not in our interests, nationally or personally, to support the Nice Treaty and who tell us the addition of new members will mean less for us, particularly in the agricultural sphere, and that at a time when we are about to become net contributors, why should we cut a rod with which to beat ourselves. We have heard those arguments and have seen them in print. Does it occur to <Col N="32" /> these &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo; cynics that had these selfish motives motivated the movers and shakers of Europe when we were applicants, we would not have been admitted to the EEC in the first instance in 1973? However, most of those who oppose the Nice Treaty are precisely the same people, or their ideological successors, who opposed our entry in the first place and have opposed every step we have taken to make the EU what it is today.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Ring and I do not put him in that category. He told us that he, along with others, had believed that the free movement of people, goods and services would mean that one could buy a car at the same price throughout the EU and that one could go to Germany, Belgium or wherever, buy a Mercedes or any vehicle and bring it back without any difficulty. Deputy Ring obviously thought in terms of common market, common Merc. I understand what he said and I hope we will evolve to that. It is not the fault of the EU but of our Government and of successive Governments that this is the situation. He regretted that Britain is not part of the euro. I regret that too and I hope that will not be the case for long and that when Tony Blair and his very pro-EU Chancellor, Gordon Brown, get the majority they expect and deserve that situation will change reasonably quickly and the pace to join the euro will quicken. I believe that will be the case.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons Deputy Ring had reservations about Europe and some people I suppose would describe him as a euro sceptic, but I would not. On the basis of what he said today, it is clear he is not a euro sceptic because he came out very strongly in saying that if we are members of the EU, of such an institution, it was demanded of us that we be prepared to defend that institution. Surely, there is no stronger mark of commitment to Europe than a determination to defend those institutions. That was what Deputy Ring said and there is no greater reason to describe him as European. The mark of a real European is the willingness and commitment to defend Europe against anyone who would attack it.</P>
    <P>There is still room for idealism in politics, nationally and internationally, but man shall not live by idealism alone and bread must also be considered. Europe has been good to us in bread terms. An enlarged Europe is an enlarged market and we are already doing very well in some of the applicant countries, particularly in Poland. The Nice Treaty will help to make the world a safer place for our children and grandchildren as it has helped make it a safer world for us.</P>
    <P>On my travels I am pleased to meet young supremely confident Irish people. I have had the pleasure of meeting them in places like Paris, Rome and Berlin. They are doing worthwhile jobs and many of them are excelling in those jobs. The experience of Europe has proved them to be second to none. I was acutely aware of the inferiority complex so many Irish people had in relation to the British, in particular, and, I sup<Col N="33" /> pose, of the inferior complex which so many people from Northern Ireland had, particularly those from a unionist background, in relation to the British. When one meets these young people in other parts of Europe, they no longer have an inferiority complex and they are confident of their place in the world and of their ability to do the job. This is something new which is to be welcomed. Membership of the EU has contributed very substantially to that. One does not have to go outside the country to realise the difference in attitudes from those 20 years ago. Being part of Europe has played a very considerable part in that.</P>
    <P>There are people who are opposed to the role of the United States in the world and take every opportunity to castigate it and all it stands for and yet some of these people tell us that we should not support a stronger more integrated and united Europe capable of playing a greater world role. I am, and have always been, pro America. The United States has its own interests which will not always coincide with European interests, as has been the case in the past. There has been an example of American short-term self-interest being promoted over the interests of the rest of humanity in recent days in regard to the Kyoto Protocol. It is almost inevitable that American interests will move more towards the Pacific and Asia. US foreign policy will become more dominated by considerations relating to China, in particular. A strong European voice will be a factor for stability in the world in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the upcoming referenda. I share the reservations of those who doubt the wisdom of holding three other constitutional votes on the same day. Only one is likely to excite an interest and a constitutional change to ban capital punishment in circumstances where there is little chance of it ever being used again does not appear necessary to many people. I also support Members who wonder what the rush is about and why it is necessary at such short notice to push a referendum that could be held at any time up to the end of 2002 following proper debate and rational discussion. I support Deputy Ring's comments in that context. People have a right to know.</P>
    <P>However, principally, I am concerned about the possibility of a low turnout and I wonder whether a referendum is necessary. Garret FitzGerald wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, under the headline, &ldquo;Complexity of Nice Treaty likely to turn off voters&rdquo;. He stated: &ldquo;Popular rather than parliamentary ratification of treaties is an unusual process in international affairs and, as became clear at the time of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, it poses considerable problems when the content of such a treaty is complex and does not centre on a single issue that can be clearly put to the electorate&rdquo;. He illustrated his argument by demonstrating that there is a parallel between the increasing complexity of the issues that people have been asked to vote on and a decreasing turnout. He <Col N="34" /> speculated that a turnout of 56% for the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty was only possible because it was combined with a referendum on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that future treaties will be even more complex and unclear to everyone except those who drafted and negotiated them. If Dr. FitzGerald is correct we could arrive at a point where a low poll could be the result and that would not have credibility with anyone. The Minister stated: &ldquo;The decision to have a referendum is based on the clear legal advice that ratification of the treaty by the State requires constitutional change&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;Overall it is clearly desirable that any risk of legal uncertainty on matters of such importance to the State as the treaties establishing the Community and the Union should be avoided&rdquo;. Presumably the clear legal advice to which he referred is that of the Attorney General. Perhaps, when replying, the Minister will elaborate on the advice.</P>
    <P>If we are to be bound by precedent on this matter and as a result future referenda on more complex issues are to be decided by fewer votes, at some stage we might be forced to re-examine this issue. Ireland has a written Constitution but it is the only country which must hold a referendum on the Nice Treaty. While I agree &ldquo;it is clearly desirable that any risk of legal uncertainty on matters of such importance . . . should be avoided&rdquo;, I wonder whether other legal advice might have been different or whether the Bill could have been referred to the Supreme Court to remove any uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I have reservations on these matters of procedure and timing, but they pale into relative insignificance in the face of the unconditional support I give to a larger, stronger, more integrated Europe. I hope for a large poll and a resounding majority.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Nice Treaty is to make changes to prepare the European Union for enlargement. Enlargement in this context means an increase in membership of the Union from 15 to 27 member states. The Commission's strategy paper on enlargement, published last November, envisaged substantial progress with the advanced applicant states by mid-2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has benefited and continues to benefit greatly from Community membership and it is in its interest that the Community can operate and take decisions even with the larger membership. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by the enlarged Union. The Single Market will expand to more than 500 million people and the opportunities for our exporters are obvious. Companies such as AIB and CRH <Col N="35" /> have already demonstrated that the applicant countries also provide excellent opportunities for Irish investment in growing markets.</P>
    <P>The decisions take at Nice fully protect Ireland's essential interests. First, we achieved our priority objective on taxation. All decisions in this area will continue to be by unanimity. Second, there was a balanced outcome to the formation of the Commission beginning with the next one in 2005. The five larger states will give up their right to nominate a second commissioner and there will then be one commissioner per state. When the Commission membership reaches 27, which could be more than a decade away, a rotation system will be used. However, an Irish commissioner will serve on the same basis as a French or German commissioner.</P>
    <P>Third, as part of the deal for giving up their second commissioner, the larger states will have an increased voting weight. However, Ireland's voting weight is only marginally affected and remains the same as Finland and Denmark. In any event, most Union decisions are taken by consensus and in practice issues rarely divide on a big-small state basis. Another important safeguard and valuable protection for smaller states agreed at Nice was that decisions must have the support of the majority of member states.</P>
    <P>Critics of the treaty will no doubt point out that there is a related requirement that decisions also necessitate the support of 62% of the Union's population and this could be perceived as beneficial to larger states and Germany, in particular. This change is more apparent than real. It is lower than the level which applied in practice between 1958 and 1995. The outcome in regard to the European Parliament is also satisfactory. With 12 seats Ireland will continue to have a better ratio of seats to population than every other state with the exception of Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>An objective assessment of the relatively limited changes proposed by the Nice Treaty must be that Ireland has nothing to fear and much to gain from equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead. Ireland has demonstrated over the past three decades that it is fully capable of adapting to and taking advantage of the benefits and opportunities which full participation in the Union has offered. Change holds no fear for Ireland. We have benefited enormously from being to the forefront of the EU economically, politically and socially.</P>
    <P>The people have consistently rejected those who have argued for an inward, introverted vision based on a lack of confidence on the capacity of Ireland to advance its interests successfully in the EU. However, the increase in size of the Union will have an impact on Ireland. If the money given to Ireland under the CAP is excluded, this year, for the first time, it will be a net contributor to the Union. That will continue and our contribution will increase when the applicant states become members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> There are significant opportunities for Ireland in the emerging states. I am concerned that in terms of business, as a nation, we are not aggressive in seeking out opportunities in these emerging economies. While I have mentioned AIB and CRH, there are many other examples of opportunities for Irish companies in the emerging economies of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Cyprus. Cyprus will probably be one of the first applicant countries to join the Union.</P>
    <P>It is important that we open Irish embassies in these countries. The Government should lead the way for the Irish business community in taking up the opportunities that exist. There are good opportunities in the areas for which I have responsibility, such as forestry and fishing. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have large forestry developments and some Irish people are already investing in them. Coillte is involved in consultancy work in those countries. There are exciting opportunities for Irish investment in the forestry sector.</P>
    <P>That is equally true of fishing. The Common Fisheries Policy is currently being reviewed but there are opportunities for Ireland to get involved in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in terms of investing, joint ventures and exploiting the market opportunities in those countries. Ireland has not yet seen the significance of those opportunities. Some Irish companies have investigated the potential of those markets but only a small number. One can see the interest those countries have in Ireland by the number of delegations that come here and the amount of help they seek from us, both in Brussels and in Departments. Those countries want to be involved in Ireland but we, unfortunately, have not wanted to take advantage of the opportunities they present. I hope this debate will highlight that.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been good for Ireland in the areas for which I have responsibility. The forestry premium scheme, launched in 1990, was an important incentive for forestry development. The support provided by the EU in the 1994-99 period was significant and the national development plan for 2000-06 is critical for the success of the strategic plan for forestry. Under the plan there will be a total investment of approximately £540 million, of which the EU will contribute approximately 50%, to support extensive new planting to deliver on the Government's objective of sustainable development of forestry in line with sectoral and environmental targets.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in incentives for new planting, averaging approximately 30%, were introduced last year under the plan. There will be much greater compatibility between forestry and other farm supports, notably REPS, and it is anticipated that 128,000 hectares will be planted during the period of the plan. In the same period more than £90 million will be provided to support strategic measures on harvesting, access roads and downstream developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The common fisheries policy is under review. The economics of the EU fishing sector are increasingly worrying in a scenario of high costs, labour market difficulties and a shrinking resource base. Politically, the challenges are to secure the involvement of the stakeholders in the decision making process and to create a level playing field in compliance and enforcement. To prepare the Irish position, the national strategy review group of the CFP was set up in December 1998 under the chairmanship of Padraig White. The group presented me with a series of reports, culminating in a comprehensive set of proposals and recommendations which were published last November. That was in advance of the Commission's Green Paper in order to influence the Commission's thinking.</P>
    <P>The report has been circulated widely throughout the EU and the Green Paper on the CFP, published two weeks ago by the EU, was strongly influenced by the policy positions we put forward. In that respect, Ireland will have a major influence in the review of the CFP, which we hope will be to our benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on signing the Nice Treaty. It is a major step towards the historic enlargement of the Union which opens the way for the admission of up to 12 candidate countries. Negotiations are currently concluding with these countries.</P>
      <P>We must ensure the European Union functions effectively when enlargement takes place. This is a major concern about enlargement. There should be a strong message that the Union will adhere to the agreed timetable and ensure enlargement proceeds on schedule. This is not the first enlargement of the European Union. Ireland joined the original six states of the then EEC with Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1973. Greece joined in 1981 and Portugal and Spain joined in 1986. The last enlargement in 1995 brought the membership to 15 when Austria, Finland and Sweden joined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move towards the forthcoming enlargement was triggered by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before that, there was no political process in many of the present candidate countries. I was a member of the Council of Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and some of the countries in question could not join that body because they had no democratic process or respect for civil liberties or minorities. A procedure was put in place to give those countries what was known as &ldquo;guest status&rdquo;. It gave them an opportunity to establish a democratic process, a foot in the door, as it were, so elections could be held in those countries and a civil and human rights regime put in place. It has often been suggested that guest status should be available for countries joining the European Union. I do not know if it is feasible but I am sometimes disappointed that no effort is made to see if countries are fulfilling their commitments in that regard. That has been <Col N="38" /> mentioned in relation to many of the countries already in the Union.</P>
    <P>Representatives from the candidate countries have visited the Oireachtas and attended meetings of the committees on foreign affairs and European affairs. It was clear from them that they are anxious to be part of a dynamic and exciting European Union. The Nice Treaty must be ratified by the 15 member states and I am confident that, as on four previous occasions in the past 30 years, the Irish people will again say yes to the European Union and enlargement in the referendum. A major effort will be required by all political parties that support the treaty because there is a degree of complacency about Europe.</P>
    <P>When many people hear the words &ldquo;environment&rdquo; or &ldquo;area of conservation&rdquo; they immediately blame the European Union. Many EU directives have caused difficulties, particularly for hill farmers in the west of Ireland. Obviously, issues such as over grazing on mountains, turf cutting and special areas of conservation have caused problems. The relevant Department, under various Ministers, has tried to handle these issues sensitively. I pay tribute to the Ministers and Ministers of State in those Departments over the past number of years. It was an area that had to be handled sensitively. The interests of Ireland and the European Union are intertwined and affect many aspects of our national life. Enlargement will lay the basis for a new era of stability and prosperity across the European continent, as well as bringing new opportunities for Irish exporters when the extension of the single market is taken into account. The Irish economy will grow, as will employment. Irish business people are already exploring new markets in the candidate countries. The Minster for the Marine and Natural Resources referred to AIB and CRH, which are already major players in Poland, and I know of Irish business people who have already invested in other countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Irish people have seen the benefits of the European Union and when opportunities have presented themselves we have taken the path of closer integration. For example, we decided to participate in economic and monetary union and to sign the social charter, despite the difficulties caused by our then considerable dependence on the British market.</P>
    <P>There is great interest in the west of Ireland in regional development. The new status of the Border, midland and western region is very welcome. It is important to get new investment for the BMW region and we should obviously see a bias towards and priority for that region when it comes to investment. There have already been major job announcements in Cavan, Donegal and Longford, areas which did not get enough investment in the past.</P>
    <P>We have taken advantage of the opportunities offered by membership and we have received assistance from the EU Structural Funds, which contributed to turning the economy around. One <Col N="39" /> of the biggest water schemes to have received investment is the Tuam regional water supply, which not only supplies north Galway but is earmarked for extension into the city of Galway. That scheme was originally costed at more than £20 million and the costs have increased since but it is a worthwhile regional scheme for the whole county. Motorways, dual carriageways and bypass routes have all been funded and these developments are shortening routes both east to west and north to south. The major development sanctioned for the Galway to Ballinasloe route is part of the £1 billion development of the Galway to Dublin route.</P>
    <P>The social charter leads me to praise social partnership. Employer organisations, trade union representatives, farmers and the community and voluntary sectors have all been very important in achieving progress in this regard. Farmers have supported the various referenda on these issues. Given the foot and mouth disease threat, it is vital to continue EU support, having regard to the benefits of schemes involving farm modernisation, farm retirement and the installation aid scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of my colleagues, including the Minister, that we should have widespread public discussion of European issues before debating further changes. The Irish experience is very relevant to what we are discussing. A booklet produced by the European Movement states that in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC our GDP, at current market prices, per head of population equalled 58.8%, while by the same measure the 2001 figure is 111.7%. The EU average at both times was 100% and the figures for the majority of applicants are currently less than half the EU average, so our experience has the attention of those candidate countries. I hope we vote for enlargement and give these countries the opportunity we got back in 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the debate on this legislation, which enables a referendum to take place and the debate during the referendum campaign itself are tolerant. It is also important that this is the last time we have a discussion of a European treaty with such poor preparation. As contributions are made and people arrive at different conclusions, it is important they listen carefully to the reservations expressed and the circumstances in which those reservations arose. The construction of what a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote might be are both equally important and on balance, despite many criticisms I may make, a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would be disastrous, particularly in relation to the future of Europe and the position of the applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which the Intergovernmental Conference was conducted meant there was very little public participation or attempt to make contact with the citizens. The arrangements were almost regarded as technical and intergovernmental, part of a diplomatic process, which is only <Col N="40" /> true in part. I say this in an attempt to be positive. Also, in preparation for the ministerial meetings, it would be far better to have a dialogue preceding the meetings which gives an opportunity to articulate issues. Otherwise one is sinking into different versions of spinning the outcome. Some British newspapers suggested, for example, that the Taoiseach was pleased with the British Prime Minister's success with taxation. Others printed a story that the Taoiseach had a great success in relation to taxation with the assistance of Tony Blair.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in that kind of thing; I am interested in matters such as the conclusion in Annex 4, which specifies the need for an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 to re-examine some of the matters on which it is hoped to make progress, particularly in relation to the institutions of the European Union, on which there was great failure. In terms of the French expectations expressed for it, Nice fell disastrously short of what was hoped. That being the case, our preparations, in terms of public debate, were disastrously exclusive.</P>
    <P>It is important now to commit ourselves to a different kind of debate. I am trying to be positive but perhaps my last negative comment is to say that I have listened carefully to all the speeches, including that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and there is something paradoxical and ironic about some of the Government speakers' contributions. On one hand they talk about their bigger vision for Europe, for which I am inclined to applaud them, and then they talk about the new population of Europe, with the applicant countries admitted, as being a market of 500 million. No speech has yet referred to these people as 500 million citizens with whom we might interact in different ways. There has not been a single reference to the number of languages involved or the different cultures and ethnic origins, the problems and promise of cultural diversity, issues of recognising ethnic differentiation and different forms of memory as well as different contributions to many different roots of civilisation. Having made a Boucicault gesture with a grandiose statement, we are collapsing back into stating how many people will be available to buy Irish meat, fish or milk products.</P>
    <P>It is time we steadied ourselves in relation to language. It is very clear that the process of the shaping of Europe will be entirely different with 27 member states than it was with 15 or, going back further, with six. I hope it is. If that is the case, our approach to Europe must be one in which we appreciate the complexity and depth of the peoples of Europe and the challenges and prospects beyond a narrowly economic vein.</P>
    <P>The only people more tedious than the confused language about Europe are those who belong to what may be described as the guilt brigade who wander around the country telling us to be ever more grateful. I accept that the transformation of Ireland's social and economic infrastructure could not have happened as it did with<Col N="41" /> out European assistance. That is a challenge for us not to delay the opportunities available to other countries, especially applicant countries.</P>
    <P>It is time to move the debate on to address dimensions that may have been neglected. I have given one instance in relation to culture. There are others which, in a curious way, feed into the missing dimension of citizenship, including aspects of governance. We should be positive in addressing them in terms of the peoples of Europe. If we stick to this, we will get a better result.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach suffers from the disability of a particularly backward set of statements by Ministers before and during the Nice process. Only two weeks ago the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, when replying to a question about a EU directive, told the House it knew what she thought about EU directives. In an interview in<i> Hot Press</i> the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, praised his colleague, the Minister for Finance, for telling &ldquo;that Spanish guy where to go&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance recently told Olivia O'Leary that he was especially pleased with his performance as one of the few centre right Ministers for Finance in Europe. If these and other Ministers believe we would be happier Americans than Europeans, they had better make up their minds because their views are of crucial significance in relation to the applicant countries in which they express an interest, mostly as a market rather than as a set of new colleagues in Europe. That is their tedious low grade version of those applying for membership.</P>
    <P>The countries usually described as transition economies must address the process by which the transition is to be made. Is it to be made by the crude, unqualified model of the marketplace that prevails in the United States or the social market model prevailing in Europe and from which the Minister for Finance is at such pains to distance himself? It is interesting how the Minister never addresses the kinds of statistics that could answer his question. He prefers to pride himself on what he claims to have achieved for the economy, practically single-handed. He likes to describe the transitions that have occurred, but does not tell us about comparisons between Sweden and Ireland in 1999 which show that of all foreign direct investment in the European Union, Ireland secured 6% while Sweden secured 18%. Of the investment by other EU countries within the Union, Ireland secured 3% while Sweden secured 23%. Of non-EU foreign direct investment, Ireland secured 12% &ndash; reflecting the scale of American investment &ndash; while Sweden secured 6%. According to the most recent assessment by Eurostat of where countries are placed in relation to the information economy, Ireland is placed twentieth while Sweden is placed first.</P>
    <P>There is a wonderful model available in Europe for social inclusion. It is the social model and strikingly different from the North American model that the little clique within the Cabinet <Col N="42" /> seems to favour. It is also important that, in relation to the conduct of negotiations with the applicant countries, such transitions as their economies will be making would be better served by following the social model rather than the other crude model with its enormous capacity for the destruction of social cohesion and social security and the dislodging of the opportunities for education, culture and participation in societies. That is the kind of debate we want to have about the shape of the new Europe. The notion that we can be Americans in Europe is backward, narrow-minded and, curiously, ill-informed.</P>
    <P>My party leader spoke about the establishment of a forum on the future of Europe in which we would discuss all the issues, of which democratic scrutiny is one. We need to consider how we handle what is happening in Europe and the way it is relayed back to the Legislature. We also need to consider issues of transparency and changing the language in such a way that people can be invited into the discourse. Issues of common values based on democracy, rights and common projects and those relating to effectiveness and efficiency are also aspects of a good debate.</P>
    <P>If we are to establish such a forum, a strong case could be made for not rushing this referendum. Why not allow the European Parliament, as an institution closely involved, express its opinion? Why not take the incomplete agenda at the Nice Summit and use it as an opportunity to say that we will be well prepared for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 by having the fullest possible involvement of citizens and establishing a forum in which we will hear about different visions of Europe? It is time to seek clarity in the language in contentious areas, such as security, governance and co-operation.</P>
    <P>The member states of the European Union are very different in terms of the network of alliances and the nature of their commitments to different international institutions. Examples include Britain's relationship with the United States and France's strong diplomatic relationships that are not always inclusive of EU interests. There is a need to start looking at the interlinkage between institutions and countries. There is no longer any point in dodging the role of the United States in Europe, the role of NATO, the connection between NATO in a logistical military sense and the rapid reaction force and the relationship of both institutions to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I find depressing the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his predecessors, who are thoughtful people, to the reform of the United Nations which has slipped off the agenda. A document or White Paper may include the term &ldquo;mandated by the UN&rdquo;, but how does this handle the issue of the veto and the Security Council? Where is the evidence that there is an agenda of action in terms of seeking the reform of the United Nations? The groundwork has been done in the work of Erskine Childers and Brian Urquhart, published in 1994 which contains a wonderful critique of the institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Statements by the Minister only refer to the United Nations in passing. It is an interesting suggestion that having gone ahead and structured, for example, a participation in peacemaking, peace building or peacekeeping activity, one must seek the approval or endorsement of the United Nations <i>ex post facto</i>. No matter how the Minister for Defence wriggles or no matter how the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes different statements in this House and in committees, they have a problem regarding the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960, in the context of the rapid reaction force. The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960, speaks of institutions established by the United Nations. This is not the place to go into the meaning of this word &ldquo;established&rdquo; but if the Minister were to say he would commit troops more than 12 in number for tasks other than peacekeeping and that he would secure a mandate afterwards, does that mean the same as &ldquo;established&rdquo; in the 1960 Act? I am only using it as an illustration that we should honestly and openly discuss the couplings between institutional involvements which exist in Europe. We should look at the different membership which different member countries enjoy. We should look vigorously, energetically and positively not only at our attitude but at the attitude of others towards reforming the one great institution which exists, the United Nations, which, with all its defects, still is a marvellous model and tool for governance, given the right reforms. It is time to have a debate on this openly, not at a time when one must just decide to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; with three other issues on one given day. I would welcome this kind of debate. It is a debate which will become more important, particularly in the light of the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;governance&rdquo; was not used until about a year ago. It has become fashionable now rather in the same way as the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; became fashionable in the 1970s. I presume that governance, properly approached, would mean that we are talking about strengthening the institutions of the civil society. Here again there is not a single model to be exported. In the White Paper I would have preferred if the Minister spoke in a way which recognised there is a diversity of cultures and many structures of habit and memory which inform different people in terms of the way they allow themselves to be governed. On the question: &ldquo;How does one consent to be governed, why and in what circumstances?&rdquo;, there is not a single model. It would have been better, when the word governance is used, if it had been preceded by a better reference to the importance of the institutions of the civil society and how important they will be, particularly as one moves to a Europe of 27 member states.</P>
    <P>With regard to co-operation, there is a huge problem about being open with the public about the areas in which the State will co-operate and in which it will not. If the process was open and less covert than it is at present, the Minister <Col N="44" /> would demolish much of the criticism made unfairly in this instance, that there is some great conspiracy afoot.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a second section. Beyond the transformation of economies, there is the question of the civil society &ndash; how social cohesion is to be established and inclusiveness built, and how different peoples will interact with each other.</P>
    <P>I noticed that in his speech launching the White Paper the Minister mentioned culture and said that we had somehow or other been massive beneficiaries of the European Union in this regard. I regard it as the most disappointing area. My successor rarely attends the meetings of Culture Ministers. That is deplorable, particularly regarding the important issues which must be decided, including <i>television sans frontiers</i>, public service broadcasting, etc. What it has revealed in that one area is that, while culture has never been strong even in the college of Commissioners and has been neglected in Europe because it was assumed that the Council of Europe was handling that and it had a bad history anyway, particularly in relation to war, it was and is neglected and yet it is perhaps the most important dimension for some of the applicant countries. One of the net results has been in areas like broadcasting and film. In all of these areas one has seen the &ldquo;commodification&rdquo; of Europe rather than the strengthening of its cultural diversity, and the Minister run off the field.</P>
    <P>On balance and taking everything into account, including, for example, the appalling arms production still going on in Europe, however critical I may be, to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; would give a dreadful message to the applicant countries and to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the right thing to do. The debate, however, should be characterised by tolerance and, in particular, take into account the people of the expanded Europe rather than be reduced to an argument about how many tonnes of beef or fish we will be able to sell to people who are presumed to have an insatiable appetite for Irish products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was General De Gaulle who spoke of Europe extending from the Atlantic to the Urals and this Treaty is a short and very modest step in that direction. I am somewhat surprised that an amendment to the Constitution is required to introduce this Treaty. The Treaty facilitates the enlargement of the European Union. When one looks at the history of this member state since 1 January 1973, the progress we have made and the opportunity participation in European institutions has given us, one would have to say that it would be churlish, mean spirited and low spirited of us to deny that opportunity to other European countries, many of which had to live under ideologies, which still find faint expression in this House and which inflicted considerable tyranny and suffering on those peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the constitutional question, because all that is proposed in this Bill is that the <Col N="45" /> people authorise us to implement this Treaty in the domestic legislation, when we joined the Community in 1973 a form of words was put to the people which authorised our participation in the European Communities, as they then were. Those Communities were changed by subsequent treaties, which facilitated the departure of Greenland from the European Community and which gave the Community a singular name, and none of those treaties required an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Then there were the proceedings brought by Mr. Raymond Crotty against the Taoiseach, Ireland and the Attorney General which gave a clearer definition to the constitutional provisions. What was impugned in the Crotty proceedings was the Single European Act, and it was argued that the provisions of the Single European Act, which proposed changes from unanimity to qualified majority and which extended the competences of the European Community in certain respects, infringed the Constitution. It was also argued in those proceedings that the Constitution did not permit the State to link the concept of co-operation in political and foreign policy matters with what had been agreed by the people in 1972.</P>
    <P>The High Court and the Supreme Court considered all these matters. The High Court decided to uphold the position of the State, that the provisions regarding qualified majority voting and conferring further competences on the European Union did not infringe the Constitution. Mr. Justice Barrington stated in the High Court that it was clear that what the founders of the European Communities had in mind was a growing dynamic Community gradually achieving its objectives over a period. Clearly the view was taken at that stage that what the people signed up for in that referendum late in 1972 was a dynamic developing Community, and the courts accepted that.</P>
    <P>That view of the High Court was confirmed on appeal. The Supreme Court stated that its opinion was that neither the proposed changes from unanimity to qualified majority nor the identification of topics, which, while now separately stated, were within the original aims and objectives of the EEC  &ndash;  the original treaty, the Treaty of Rome, contained a very wide list of objectives in its preamble &ndash; brought the proposed amendments outside the scope and authorisation contained in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the people have authorised us to join the European Community. The Maastrict Treaty required a constitutional amendment. There was no question but that it represented a fundamental change in the character of the Union. That treaty was submitted to the people and approved by them.</P>
    <P>When it came to the Amsterdam Treaty, the Government took the view that there should be a referendum and one was held. I do not understand why this proposal does not fall within the scope of at least what the people authorised some years ago in voting to approve the Amsterdam <Col N="46" /> Treaty. It seems to be a concession on the part of the State to say there is a constitutional impediment here because I fail to see it. The Government view, as I deduce from what the Minister said, seems to be that the expression &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership&rdquo; in Article 29 means that every singular Act, which it is proposed to bring into our law as a consequence of European Union membership has to be established to be necessitated in the sense of not stemming from a fresh international obligation. If one takes that view, it is at variance with what the Supreme Court said in the Crotty case, that there was a broad authorisation given to the State and that the State treaty making power was not so limited that we cannot modify, in some minor way as this treaty does, the Community provisions. This is an important point.</P>
    <P>We are the only member state in Europe that will vote on this treaty. It may be as a matter of political prudence, as we have had so many referendums on European membership, that we should have another one. As a citizen of Ireland, I am glad and proud to be in a position to vote for a legal instruments that will facilitate further membership and participation in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for General de Gaulle, but Deputy Dukes might not go along with me on this one. I believe generally in the <i>Europ de patrie</i> as well. I believe the interest of this <i>patrie </i>has been well safeguarded by this treaty and that there is not any danger to Ireland in its provisions. I was astonished to hear Deputy Gormley highlight yesterday what he considered various perils and dangers in this treaty. This treaty is simply the left-over treaty from Amsterdam. It tidies up a number of matters that were not addressed in the Amsterdam Treaty. Much of the European, continental and international criticism of this treaty has been that it does not go far enough away from the <i>Europ de patrie</i>, that it does not do enough to consolidate Europe as a growing federal organism, with which I personally do not agree.</P>
    <P>This treaty is a good practical compromise. It is like all the treaties. A large number of member states were represented and there was great difficulty inducing all of them to sign up to the final instrument, but eventually they all did. It facilitates participation by other member states. Fine Gael and the rest of the Opposition will say it would be great if we could always have an Irish Commissioner, but the practicalities are that as the Community extends and we move beyond the figure of 27&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have on occasion, but the practicalities are that as the membership of the Union extends, there is an inevitable requirement that the Commission should be efficient in its <Col N="47" /> decision making. It is in the interests of smaller member states such as ourselves that the Commission can act as the guardian and protector of the treaties and of the interests of smaller member states.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for Fine Gael, a party founded on the principle of a sensible compromise, when Fianna Fáil proposes the sensible compromise on this occasion, but it is a sensible compromise in relation to the Commission. The larger member states have abandoned having a second Commissioner. That will impart to the Commission a greater quality of independence and detachment from the member states concerned.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the constitutional question, which I consider important, as we have a right, as members of the legislative assembly, to ensure our capacity to enact a treaty is unimpaired and that we do not have to have a referendum every time a treaty is presented.</P>
      <P>Other questions about foreign policy were raised by Deputy Gormley yesterday. Before I deal with them, I wish to say how interested I was in Deputy Higgins's comments. I agree that we need to strengthen the United Nations and to put forward sensible proposals about how it can improve its working and operation. In so far as the foreign and security area is concerned, there is nothing in this treaty that imposes a single additional obligation on this State that was not already in the Amsterdam and Maastricht arrangements. Reference to the Western European Union has been deleted from the treaty provisions, as it is no longer in operation, but there is no additional obligation imposed on Ireland in that area by this treaty. The Government said, and it is clear in the White Paper, that it is its policy to continue our policy of military neutrality and that we will participate only in operations that have United Nations sanction. I do not know what the opponents of this treaty's provisions on that ground are proposing. Are they suggesting something should be written into the Constitution on our participation in peacekeeping operations or multilateral operations to preserve peace or emergency operations? I would consider that as a wrong development and I would not support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original framer of the Constitution made it clear when it was drawn up that the whole idea about international relations was that it would be put outside the Constitution. The question of membership of the Commonwealth of Nations was left outside the Constitution and our international policy generally was left to the Government of the day to decide. When people talk about neutrality in this House it must be remembered that when the Constitution was drawn up we did not subscribe to a policy of neutrality but to one of collective security through the League of Nations. That machinery broke down and we then adopted a policy of neutrality. I am not saying it was a wrong policy. It was the correct policy at the time from the point of view of our needs and interests. We have participated in the collec<Col N="48" /> tive security arrangement of the United Nations and I agree with Deputy Higgins that we should see how that system can be improved, but as long the Security Council system is there and the veto is in place on the Security Council, there is a certain weakness in the collective enforcement machinery of the United Nations. What is wrong with our participation in a European collective security arrangement devoted as it is to certain minimal tasks relating to peacekeeping and emergencies? I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I was concerned yesterday when I heard Deputy Gormley link this question with the question of arms acquisition and procurement. He suggested that this State was engaging in extravagant armaments expenditure. As I understand it, this State has invested in the purchase of armoured personnel carriers, which protect our personnel when they are on peacekeeping missions, be it with the United Nations or any force to which the United Nations will lend sanction under these arrangements. I cannot see what is wrong with that investment or why our soldiers should not be protected in the same way soldiers and sailors of other jurisdictions are protected when they go on these missions.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House &ndash; I am not one of them as I was only a child at the time, but growing up in a garrison town I recall the memory of it &ndash; will remember what happened in the Congo when many of our soldiers went out with inadequate equipment. It is correct that the Minister should invest in whatever equipment is required to protect soldiers on peacekeeping missions. To link that with some sort of Bismarcian suggestion of an expansion in armament is ludicrous. If that is the standard of debate that will be conducted on this referendum, I would be concerned about the outcome.</P>
    <P>It is important that people understand the issues in this proposal and that they vote on them. I propose to do all in my power in my constituency to urge people to vote on this. The key issue in this proposal is that it will give other countries the opportunity to participate in the Community in the future. They are longing for that. It is misleading to suggest, as has been suggested in the debate, that somehow the provisions in relation to enhanced co-operation are to their disadvantage. The people in those countries are crying out for Community membership. To suggest this treaty has been designed to put them at a disadvantage or to trap them in some way is inaccurate. There will be accession arrangements negotiated with these countries. That is where the crunch issues will be determined, but at this stage there is nothing in this treaty that will disadvantage them. Quite the opposite is the case. A rejection by Ireland of this treaty would not alone damage our standing in the current membership of the European Union, a far more serious consequence is that it would damage our standing in the countries that wish to apply to the Union. These countries have been crying out for mem<Col N="49" /> bership for so long that it would be churlish of us to obstruct any instrument which would facilitate it.</P>
    <P>Another change is that the Court of First Instance in the European Court of Justice is being given additional jurisdiction. That is practical because the current arrangement in relation to the court is that preliminary rulings have to be referred to the full court which acts as a court of final resort. The court sits in chambers for the purpose of disposing the large volume of business it has to conduct. Any court or tribunal in any member state can refer a question to the European Court of Justice, but because that means the full court, it does not assist its efficient organisation. The Court of First Instance will now be in a position to deal with some of the referrals, a welcome change.</P>
    <P>On the question of enhanced co-operation, it is important to indicate that nothing is being done which will interfere with the sovereign rights of individual states. What is being proposed is that where a group of member states wish to come together and pursue a common purpose, they will be free to do so, notwithstanding the objections of one member state which does not wish to participate. Closer forms of co-operation are not intrinsically wrong. We are living in an era of globalisation and the challenge, well addressed by Deputy Higgins, is how we address it in deepening our concept of citizenship, participation by citizens in civic institutions and the securing of social justice. To continue to analyse documents of this type in the light of the 19th century idea of sovereignty popularised in this country by the British <i>jurisdice</i> whose echoes live on in some of the minor parties, most extraordinarily Sinn Féin, is not a&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a realistic way of looking at our place in the world today. We could, for example, look at the regrettable and deplorable decision of the United States Administration in relation to the Kyoto accord. We must be realistic, however, and realise that Ireland on its own will not be listened to on the issue. We must work with our European partners to effect progress on it. The people must understand this. We must give leadership and explain to them that that is where we see ourselves going. There is tremendous confidence in Ireland about the European idea, judging from voters in my area. Some of us apologists have suffered from being like an oversubsidised industry and are somewhat out of touch with the mood of the population. In general, the population is well disposed to Europe and would welcome the treaty if it was made clear what it is all about and if the various canards were ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins was right to recall the human and cultural dimension of enlarge<Col N="50" /> ment which is being overlooked in much of this debate. It is a matter about which I know something as I have spent time in nine of the candidate countries and a substantial amount of time in seven of them where I have been involved in advising their Governments or their administrations on issues connected with enlargement, institution building, public administration, trade policy and other areas. I know them fairly well and have political links with another two. There are three which I have not yet visited, but I hope to do so in time.</P>
      <P>What struck me is the way the populations and political systems of those countries view enlargement is unknown here. All these states and their peoples want to be a part of the European Union. They want to be part of the enterprise that is the Union, of which they have a wider appreciation than many of us seem to have because we get too tied up with the details.</P>
      <P>Another striking aspect is that they want to join because they want a guarantee of continued economic and political independence and security. This is shared by the vast majority in every candidate country except Cyprus and Malta where the situations are entirely different. They are not sure that there is a guarantee of stability and adhesion to democracy to the east that would allow them to be happy in remaining outside the grouping that is the European Union. This means that they all want to join NATO because they do not see the European Union, as currently constituted post the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, as being the kind of community that can offer them physical security in addition to economic and political security. That is an interesting reflection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the view of the vast majority in those states, but one which the opponents of the treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty, the Maastricht Treaty, the Single European Act and our Accession Treaty consistently ignore. They oppose every move by the European Union to place itself in a position where it could give a better guarantee of social, political, cultural independence and freedom to these countries. What do they propose in its place? There is only one expression, that I know of, of what they want to put in its place and it is a muddled one shared, apparently, by the National Platform and the Green Party. It is set out most completely in the Green Party Ireland's bible, a book by Richard Douthwaite entitled <i>Growth Illusion. </i>They call it sustainable local development, a system under which we would all voluntarily return to living our lives in our home parish, adopting the romantic green system of economy that they propose and using a paper token system instead of money. That is the alternative vision of Deputies Gormley and Sargent and Patricia McKenna, MEP. They propose this alternative for the people of Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech and Slovak Republics, the three Baltic states and Slovenia who are ten years from their history of extreme oppression and deprivation of liberty. That is what the opponents of the treaty propose. That is the basis on which <Col N="51" /> opponents construct all the niggling arguments about what the treaty proposes, as we heard yesterday evening from Deputy Gormley.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2, together.</P>
      <P>I launched MediaLab Europe last July at the Guinness Hop Store as a leading research facility in internet, multimedia and information and communication technologies. Since then, significant and very encouraging progress has been made with this project in terms of sponsorship, research, attraction of academic staff and students, and the appointment of a chief executive.</P>
      <P>As part of the agreement to establish MediaLab Europe, the Government is committed to providing a suitable premises. MediaLab Europe currently occupies the top floor of the Guinness Hop Store pending the finalisation of property purchase.</P>
      <P>I am happy that progress to date is broadly in line with our plans for MediaLab Europe, which is well on track to meeting its objective of helping to move Ireland up the value chain in terms of research and development capacity.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile to recall the distinction between the MediaLab Europe project and the wider digital hub proposal which relates to enterprise development, building on the types of expertise and technology complementary to, and arising from, MediaLab Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the MediaLab Europe development, I wonder if I can have an answer to a question I asked previously. I asked why there was no tendering process used for the establishment of a Media Lab in Ireland given that there has been quite a difference between the funding in computer science and mathematics over the past decade &ndash; about £500,000 per year for 12 projects, compared to £28 million for this external institute. Can the Taoiseach explain, and perhaps consult with those who have a problem <Col N="52" /> with such a huge gap in investment between ongoing indigenous research and this particular institute, so that there will be some reason and some transparency in the establishment of this institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government was approached initially by MIT, which was seeking a suitable European location to establish a sister entity to its highly successful and prestigious Media Lab laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This coincided with a report published in 1998, which highlighted the need to rectify significant deficiencies in our research and development capacity, particularly in emergent technologies. Before committing to the project, the Government obtained both international and local expert advice. The consensus of this advice was that MIT was a world leader with an unrivalled reputation and that MediaLab Europe presented a unique opportunity for Ireland.</P>
      <P>There was initial concern shown by some of the universities about the project. To the best of my knowledge, this has been resolved. The investment in MediaLab Europe has to be seen in the context of the investment of almost £1.95 billion allocated to research and development in the national development plan. Some £560 million has been allocated to the Technology Foresight Fund to establish this country as a world centre for information communication technology and biotechnology. In addition, the sum of £220 million has been allocated in a public-private initiative towards research programmes in third-level institutions. The Government decision approving the MediaLab Europe project also included approval for funding for Irish universities to engage in collaborative projects, and to date, 11 institutions have been signed up. They have all been approved by the Government liaison committee, in which the Higher Education Authority plays a prominent part. Ultimately, the decision to invest in MediaLab Europe was taken in the knowledge that an unprecedented level of resources was being committed to third-level research and development. The amount that has been given to date to MediaLab Europe is only a small fraction of the overall resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that there are still very significant concerns in the universities that they will be starved of the money required to carry out necessary research. There is another concern that MediaLab Europe will attract a significant proportion of donations from the business community for research, donations which at the moment are available to the universities. The collaborative proposals between MediaLab Europe and the universities have only been allocated a budget of £1 million One eminent university researcher described this as the equivalent of throwing a candy bar into an orphanage. Would the Taoiseach look at these concerns? My party supports MediaLab Europe, we think it is an interesting project, but there are <Col N="53" /> difficulties emerging in the local area, in terms of property prices, and the development of the surrounding area. Difficulties are also emerging with the concerns now being expressed by the presidents of the universities. Is the Taoiseach aware of these concerns and will he reply to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at those concerns and I will ask the Government liaison committee, the steering committee, to address them. We very much want to work with the universities. The universities had been concerned at the outset that they would have no involvement in these projects. However, there are already 11 approved projects with their involvement.</P>
      <P>The progress on the MediaLab Europe project is being carefully monitored by the Government liaison committee. Many Government Departments are represented on this committee, including the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. It is chaired by an official from my Department.</P>
      <P>Frameworks have been agreed with MediaLab Europe and these have been designed to enable the committee to monitor targets and objectives in relation to several critical issues. These include the attraction of high calibre research projects, researchers and students to MediaLab Europe and the commitment of MIT MediaLab to achieving this. I am told that these are people, projects and researchers which would not otherwise be in Ireland. In assessments I have read, such people have not been in Irish universities. Dr. Daniel O'Hare was very much a driving force, with the other universities. One of the university presidents who is a member of the group also states that and he has been involved in this for more than a decade.</P>
      <P>The commitment of MIT personnel, the recognition of time spent in MediaLab Europe by Irish and foreign students for degree granting purposes, the agreement of international sponsorship targets and a system of financial reporting will also be dealt with under the new frameworks.</P>
      <P>I will consider the other points raised but I wish to emphasise that up to 1998 there was little or no money invested in research and development. Now, under the national development plan, £560 million has been allocated to the technology foresight fund. That money will go to university projects, campus companies and the third level area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are concerns about property speculation, as mentioned by Deputy Noonan. As with any new project of this type, property values in the area have increased. The Department of Finance has concerns about that but not for MediaLab Europe. MediaLab Europe is to receive £28 million over a four year period. That is scheduled. There is no difficulty with MediaLab Europe. It is the digital hub area and one with which the Department of Finance is concerned, as it is with the level of finance required to buy some of the buildings. The Department has a valid point in believing that the State should not buy up all the <Col N="54" /> buildings, but should simply provide enough to get the centre going. After that it should be enterprise driven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach look again at the inadequate budget for collaborative projects between MediaLab Europe and the universities, which currently stands at only £1 million? There is no reason that figure could not be raised to a more significant amount which would satisfy university researchers if the Taoiseach was to intervene. Will the Taoiseach explain in precise terms the relationship between MediaLab Europe and the digital media district project? Will he also list any directors appointed by the Government to either of the two projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction between the two projects. The MediaLab Europe centre is that set up by the Government to link directly with MIT. The Government is investing £28 million towards research and start-up costs for that project. The digital media district is the entire operation. It is the driver to attract the companies which will spring from the hub into the overall area. The costing and the scope and extent of the development plan has not yet been agreed. It is the subject of discussions with the Department of Finance but the company, Digital Media Development Ltd, is in place.</P>
      <P>The directors of the MediaLab Europe board are: Mr. Nicholas Negroponte of MIT who is the chairman; Mr. Rudolph Berger, the recently appointed chief executive officer; Mr. Gerhard Schulmeyer, the president and chief executive officer of Siemens Corporation; Mr. Bob Metcalfe, the founder of 3 Com and currently with International Data Group; Mr. Larry Bacow, the chancellor of MIT; Mr. Denis O'Brien, an entrepreneur; Dr. Daniel O'Hare, the ex-president of DCU; Mr. Red Burns, the head of the communications and multi-media school at New York University; Ms Ann O'Riordan, the outgoing country manager of Microsoft, and Bono of U2.</P>
      <P>The board of Digital Media Development is chaired by Mr. Patrick Teahon formerly the Secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach. The other members are: Mr. Dan Flinter of Enterprise Ireland; Mr. Don Thornhill of the Higher Education Authority; Mr. John Fitzgerald, Dublin city manager; Mr. Paul Kavanagh, Mr. Paul McGuinness, Mr. Peter Cassells and Ms Jacqui Harrison of IBEC.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question last December, the Taoiseach stated that legislation to provide for and to underpin Digital Media Development Ltd. was in preparation. There is no reference to any legislation under that title in the schedule circulated by the Chief Whip. What legislation is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the concerns of the Department of Finance centred on the possibility of insider trading in property, with the Government having <Col N="55" /> announced the creation of a digital district or cyber-village without ensuring safeguards are in place? Attention was drawn to the site in a map recently published in <i>The Irish Times</i>. What is the level of commitment that the Government is likely to give? Comparisons have been made between this project and the Temple Bar project. The State acquired and owned much of the property in Temple Bar, while, apart from the Guinness Hop Store building, it owns less property in this area. The MediaLab project in Boston, which I visited, is based in a compact space.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Underpinning legislation is necessary for this project, as with all big projects, so that it has a base and is accountable to the House under normal structures. Due to market sensitivity I am advised not to indicate particular properties as contracts have not yet closed on all properties. There are other Guinness properties adjacent to the Hop Store which would clearly be important to the hub. There are also other properties. The Department of Finance want to be certain about those other properties. The costs and prices after negotiations with Guinness are expected to be attractive to the State but it is for the Office of Public Works to negotiate on that issue. What the Department of Finance does not want is to become involved in the purchase of large amounts of property. Deputy Quinn has alluded to what were very different times in the Temple Bar area.</P>
      <P>It seems that the space required to get the project off the ground is not enormous. There is a concern that a new project will begin to move into surrounding areas and the Department of Finance do not want to get into that situation. They will deal with matters which have been looked at for some months and will close on some of those contracts, though perhaps not all. That will happen in the next month or so.</P>

      <P>Will a register of property owners for that area be maintained so that, in time, there will be full transparency regarding benefits from increases in the value of properties? This development in my constituency, particularly the digital media district area which is surrounded by some of the most disadvantaged communities in these islands, including Watling Street flats, Bridgefoot Street, Oliver Bond House, Fatima Mansions, Basin Lane, James Street flats and St. Theresa's Gardens, is very welcome. Does the Taoiseach agree the development presents a golden opportunity to ensure some of the advantages which have been experienced in Ennis are given to these communities to redress the disadvantages they suffer? Does the Taoiseach agree we should set out to provide a computer facility for each home in the area so that those who heretofore have been disadvantaged would enjoy the advantage of this information technology digital media district on their doorstep?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell has raised this matter with me several times and I have discussed with all the individuals and groups I have met the importance of involving the community. Representatives of the community have been met and a newsletter is being circulated giving details of the facilities to the local community. These steps are useful. In recent years the FIT programme has shown that people who have little or no technology skills could complete a course and take up positions in little more than a year. Although I supported the FIT programme I did not expect it to have such success in dealing with long-term unemployed people.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is a register of properties in the area. I understand negotiations are taking place between the Office of Public Works and Guinness. I know Guinness has made attractive offers to the State. There is one other development and there may be more.

      <P>When the Taoiseach welcomed the MediaLab project as a flagship project outside the United States was he aware of the MediaLab establishment going to India? What effect does he think that would that have on developments in Europe, particularly in Dublin?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware, as I have been told, that other leading world companies similar to MediaLab, were interested in setting up in Ireland? If that is the case, will the Taoiseach explain why there was no tendering process, why this company was chosen above others and why there was no consultation with the universities, who tell me they were not consulted? What checks and balances are there to ensure this is good value for State money? Academics tell me that peer review of research works is normal to ensure good standards are maintained and there is value for money. Will any such review be put in place for MediaLab?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the discussions with the Department of Finance which have already been referred to? Reports I have received indicate that the cost of property acquisition is causing a problem in the Department as much as the effects of the value of property and other issues relating to the project.</P>

Nicholas Negroponte might have had a feel for Ireland, he might have been close to the Clinton administration and some of the people involved may have been close to President Clinton. The late Ron Brown may have had an interest in Ireland since the 1995 conference. Nicholas Negroponte liked the idea of Ireland. He might have taken the project anywhere in the world.</P>

      <P>He did, and his weight. He was able to involve people such as Dr. Rudolph Berger, who is the new chief executive of MediaLab. Dr. Berger takes over the day-to-day position from Nicholas Negroponte and will live in Ireland. He has more than two decades' experience in technology and digital media in both the business and academic sectors, is a graduate of Yale and Cambridge University and has founded and managed several successful high technology companies in the United States and the United Kingdom. He has been vice-president of software at Xerox and chief technology officer at Packard-Bell and has published extensively. The appointment of a candidate of this calibre will do much to attract industry and people to this country. Irish people such as Anne O'Riordan, Bono and Denis O'Brien will be involved in the musical and business aspects of the project and others will come from outside the country. The project has created an enormous buzz.</P>
      <P>There is a risk factor in the project. If these things could be done by anyone the people involved would not be researching and doing them. They have ideas for the future and are moving ahead with the inventions of the future.</P>
      <P>The State is funding the start-up costs of MediaLab Europe. Once the facility is up and running the bulk of the revenue will come from commercial sponsorship. Sponsorship companies will have access to intellectual property. Deputy Quinn asked me about this many months ago and I sought the information he required and passed it on to him. The project is providing a huge attraction to all sorts of researchers, individuals and companies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to my Dáil statement of 29 March on the outcome of the European Council in Stockholm and my bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair. During our meeting we assessed the current situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The statement of 8 March by the two Governments set out the framework for continuing work which would help increase the momentum behind the implementation of the Agreement. There are ongoing contacts at official level between both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties as we continue our efforts to make progress on the outstanding issues. This work will continue in the period ahead. It is extremely important that we advance our consideration of all the outstanding issues in the coming weeks so that we are in the best possible position to achieve a comprehensive agreement by the June target set by the two Governments at Hillsborough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I have welcomed the statement by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 22 March in which the IICD confirmed that a meeting had taken place between it and an IRA representative. I particularly welcomed the IICD statement that at its meeting with the IRA representative a basis had been established for further discussions and that it considered the re-engagement to be &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo;. I also welcome its statement that it would build on the re-engagement at future meetings which it expected would occur soon. I now look <Col N="60" /> forward to a further meeting taking place quickly and to early progress being made on this important issue.</P>
    <P>I am in regular contact with Mr. Blair and we will meet again as and when necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two supplementary questions one concerning Northern Ireland policy and the other concerning the foot and mouth disease epidemic.</P>
      <P>On Northern Ireland we had an extensive question and answer session here about two weeks ago. Everything the Taoiseach said was based on the premise that there would be a general election in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 3 May. He talked about moving back from active negotiation towards a solution on demilitarisation, decommissioning, policing and persons on the run and said he thought that process would carry us through the election period and that he would get back to negotiation towards a settlement. In view of the deferral of the election in Great Britain by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, does the Taoiseach believe there is a new window of opportunity now where active negotiations could recommence towards finding a solution to these four outstanding matters so that the Good Friday Agreement can finally be put in place? The Taoiseach will recall saying on that occasion that he had only about a fortnight. Another five weeks can be added, which gives a seven week window.</P>
      <P>At the bilateral meeting with Mr. Blair in Stockholm, did the Taoiseach raise the issue of sheep smuggling, of sheep whose origin is in the United Kingdom, who are usually traded through the market in Carlisle, who are brought into Larne in lorries and transported south of the Border to meat factories without laying foot in Northern Ireland and which could not be described in any manner as sheep originating in Northern Ireland? Did he point out the grave concerns which arise in the area of animal health from the continuation of the smuggling of sheep?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the postponement of the election creates a different context. The original plan was that the election would take place on 3 May. The tradition in the UK and the North is that most members get a break for a fortnight after the election. Towards the end of May we would have been able to get back into negotiations on the issues &ndash; not having put them totally on the back burner for the period of the election but keeping them going at official level while at the same time recognising we would not make much progress &ndash; and have an intensive effort and commitment by everyone to make progress during the month of June and try to reach conclusions on issues in advance of the difficult period of the year, Drumcree Sunday, the first Sunday in July. Clearly that position does not hold any more. If 7 June is the date of the election and it is followed by a break, we would come back in the last week of June which is almost on <Col N="61" /> top of Drumcree Sunday. I see great difficulties with that. We are reviewing that to see if we can get more engagement now, otherwise it will be very difficult. The experience of recent years is that, for a myriad of reasons, from Drumcree Sunday no more work is done until the second half of September. Given that probably we will not get much work done in the three or four weeks up to 7 June we have to make progress. That would be our strategy. In the context of an election perhaps we may not get as much done as we would wish but we need to get further. Since Monday we have been trying to re-engage the effort of my officials, the small group of people who work on this issue and the small group on the British side who were about to pull out.</P>
      <P>I had a long range discussion on the second issue. We had breakfast with Mr. Blair on the Saturday of the weekend of the Stockholm summit where we discussed foot and mouth disease in all its aspects, including smuggling. I do not want to give the impression that we reached any resolution but I pointed out the grave difficulties it was causing for us. It is not the first time I have discussed smuggling, not only animal smuggling but other kinds of smuggling, into the Border regions in south Armagh and other regions. We have had that discussion several times. Deputy Currie has raised that issue here with me many times and the funding of paramilitaries and others. With the new emphasis on the whole area of animal health this has already been identified by Bríd Rodgers and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, at their discussions at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting. As I said this morning we can make much progress through the North-South Ministerial body. More enhanced security operations are required to try to deal with what comes through Carlisle in particular. From an island economy position, Mr. Blair is aware of what is happening in the UK but the North-South Ministerial Council needs to admit that we have to look afresh at the efforts we can make in the area of animal health for the future. In recent years we have seen salmonella, BSE, swine fever and now foot and mouth disease. While there is free movement, outside of smuggling, there has to be a fresh approach to many of these issues. That process started in the North-South Ministerial Council arising from BSE and has intensified due to the events of the past five or six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's emphasis on the time constraints between now and Drumcree Sunday. Given the urgency of the situation, what additional pressure does he intend to place on the republican movement regarding putting arms beyond use? Is he prepared to tell the republican movement that no further pussy-footing will be tolerated on the issue? Has he ever said to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness that they are members of the IRA Army Council on which Sinn Féin has a majority? <Col N="62" /> Has he ever asked them to outline what is holding up decommissioning?</P>
      <P>The British media reported that the Taoiseach had discussed the general election with the Prime Minister. This fact was of some embarrassment to Mr. Blair at a later stage. Did the Taoiseach indicate to Mr. Blair how illogical it is that, in Northern Ireland, proportional representation is used for local, assembly and European elections, but not for the Westminster election? Did he further indicate that PR is used in elections to local assemblies in Wales and Scotland and in the European elections? Will the Taoiseach impress on the Prime Minister the necessity for action to prevent abuse of the electoral process which could decide results in certain constituencies in the forthcoming election? Will the Taoiseach ask the Prime Minister to ensure these abuses do not take place, particularly with regard to postal voting, as there may be more postal voting if the foot and mouth disease emergency lasts until the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make the point regarding the voting procedure, but have heard that view many times. I will communicate it to the Prime Minister. I have raised the issue of proportional representation. John Hume has also made this point forcefully and I support his view. However, it is unlikely that there will be any change for the coming elections. I have heard the points made by the Deputy on a number of occasions. We support these views, but there has been no change in the position.</P>
      <P>I may not have put it in the terms used by the Deputy, but I have made his point on many occasions to the Sinn Féin leadership, and will continue to do so. I am due to meet Sinn Féin this week or early next week and will again emphasise that there should be no further delay in the re-engagement with the second series of discussions with John de Chastelain and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. It is important that this happens and that the commitments, as we understood them, are fulfilled as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Even after the courts' findings regarding the reinstatement of the two Sinn Féin members of the Executive to the North-South ministerial bodies, the situation is not being helped by the continued suspension by the First Minister which has, effectively, ceased the Sinn Féin members' operation of the North-South ministerial bodies. There is not much we can do about this, even though we continue to press for a resolution which is not within my hands. I have made the point that the courts have given their views in their own jurisdiction. The way to find a resolution might be through everyone helping each other. The Deputy knows what I mean by that comment.</P>

The regulations introduced in 1998 were due to expire in May 2000. They were extended for one year and will expire on 22 May 2001. What plans does the Government have to further extend them? What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the willingness of the IRA and Sinn Féin to make real progress on decommissioning which would remove the problems faced by the First Minister regarding the suspension of Sinn Féin's participation in the cross-Border institutions?</P>

      <P>That is the issue. The statements of 5 and 6 May outlined that the IRA is prepared, agreeable and committed to dealing with the arms issue in a manner which will find favour with the population at large. It more or less restated that position on 8 March and in subsequent statements. The question is whether that process will be precisely within some of the original schemes. There has been considerable discussion about amendments to the schemes to allow for other schemes. No one objects to this approach once the conclusion is the same. We share that view and have no problem if the changes are acceptable to the international commission. The objective is to put arms beyond use in a way which is acceptable to the public at large. I hope that is still the position. However, one is always concerned when progress one expects to take place quickly does not materialise.</P>

      <P>We will have to do so. As far as I recall, General de Chastelain's remit will have to be extended this year because the remit of the commission will also end. It will be essential to extend the commission's remit. I have informally discussed the Government's view with General de Chastelain and indicated that we would like him to remain after the summer in order that the matter is seen through. It would be disastrous to start a new process.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the difficulties of making progress after the end of June when we face into Drumcree Sunday, 12 July and the marching season. He also stated that nothing will happen until October. I agree with this analysis. Did the Taoiseach put this analysis to the Prime Minister and did Mr. Blair agree? Is the Prime Minister willing to push in the next five <Col N="64" /> weeks for progress on the four main outstanding issues?</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach discussed foot and mouth disease with the Prime Minister, did he raise the specific issue of paramilitary involvement in sheep smuggling and what was Mr. Blair's reaction?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken to the Prime Minister since Monday. The United Kingdom is a large country and there are many items on the Prime Minister's agenda. However, in my discussions with him in Stockholm he was conscious that the analysis I have given is correct and that the postponement of the British general election would make matters tighter as regards the talks. We have to give some time to the issue. As the Prime Minister will devote all of this week and next week to foot and mouth disease, there is unlikely to be much progress. However, at official level we will try to get matters moving next week. That is our plan. The answer to the second question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on this occasion and on many others. I think there is a great deal of evidence that paramilitaries of one kind or another are, to a substantial part, behind smuggling both in Northern Ireland&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is hard to get a straight answer on that from security sources but there is certainly involvement, and among some of the newer paramilitary groups also. That is a major concern. I purposely spoke out on this last week on the Border, because I thought it was the place to do so. I get the feeling that the reluctance of people in these communities to speak out on these issues is because they are afraid to do so. That is sad but I understand it. I met members of a particular family which would be well known in this House. It would be inappropriate to mention the name of the family but the father was killed a decade ago in this area.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997 the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area, the North Eastern and Midland Health Boards areas. Special legislation was passed allowing BreastCheck to collate a register of eligible women and screening will be offered to well women, who have no symptoms, in a systematic way so that all eligible women can be screened routinely every two years. If a woman has symptoms she should consult her general practitioner. BreastCheck is strongly committed to reaching all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years as quickly as the campaign allows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by inter<Col N="66" /> national quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles Unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion Unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile clinics. The Eccles Unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion Unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase one of the programme in place. Phase two will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase two of the programme should follow phase one as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister aware that breast screening refers to the investigation by mammography of women who have no symptoms, that is, those who believe themselves to be free of disease, whereas symptomatic patients are women who have a breast complaint and fear they may have cancer? Does the Minister agree that a high quality screening programme should be matched by equally high quality arrangements for women with symptomatic breast disease? It is now 12 months since the report on symptomatic breast services was submitted. Some 13 specialist breast units were recommended, as the Minister has stated. Will the Minister indicate where these units will be, whether the locations have been specified and whether the hospitals have been informed and the resources allocated? If not, when will the announcement be made and funding be made available?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of recently published Danish research which suggests that for women between 30 and 50 years of age, breast cancer has a 50% higher prevalence among those who do night work? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to that research? Does he or his Department have any comment on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the extension of the breast screening programme nation wide and to all women between the ages of 50 and 64 years. One of the reasons it has been introduced on a phased basis is the one put forward by the Deputy. It is essential that as one rolls out a national breast screening programme, that one has the follow up services for those who will be <Col N="67" /> found to have symptoms of breast cancer and so forth. The back up facilities have to be put in place and the necessary protocols have to be adhered to in terms of the waiting times from the screening process right up to treatment and so on. That is why phase one covers the three health board areas and phase two follows on.</P>
      <P>In terms of symptomatic breast disease, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, asked the National Cancer Forum to bring forward a report on that, which it did. It sent it to me early last year and I appointed Niall O'Higgins to oversee the implementation of that across the country. In the Estimates announced before Christmas, I allocated more than £4 million to six health agencies to allow the commencement of the development of centres. I can give all the details to the Deputy, as I did at the time &ndash; it was a matter of public record. In terms of the areas, there are two in Dublin, one in the west, one in the south west, one in the south east and one in the midlands. We made allocations to those health boards which, to a certain extent, had their plans in place and were ready to absorb the funding in 2001. We envisage rolling out the other seven in the context of the Estimates for 2002.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of local angst in some areas about the subgroup's recommendations and so on. We have managed to convince many people of the efficacy of the process, of the importance of getting state of the art centres in every region and that the concentration should be on outcomes as opposed to geographic location. We are making progress on that front.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister has no information on night work and breast cancer. Perhaps he might communicate with me separately on that. Does he agree that to achieve and maintain standards, it is essential that an audit system is put in place? The report recommended that one of the specialist breast units be designated a reference unit to co-ordinate the audit of a specialist breast unit. Does the Minister agree that St. Vincent's Hospital, in which the first breast clinic in the country was established more than 20 years ago&mdash;</P>

      <P>The decision to extend automatic medical card eligibility to those in the age group 70 years and over was announced in the budget last December. It was also stated that the measure would be introduced from July 2001. The choice of that date was to allow for the timely, agreed and effective implementation of the initiative and, in particular, to ensure the application processes for those benefiting could be as smooth and simplified as possible.</P>
      <P>All health boards are examining their organisational processes to ensure readiness. In addition, the Department is proposing to embark on a public information campaign at the end of April to promote awareness of the budget initiative. It is considered that a campaign at that time will have the greatest impact. That campaign will be conducted in conjunction with the health boards and involve media coverage, press releases, advertising features and even Internet promotion. Furthermore, the relevant section in my Department will continue to give the fullest information available to any person making an inquiry on the subject either now or in the future.</P>
      <P>The budget measure was wholly consistent with the Government's overall programme of improving the position of the elderly in society both generally and specifically in relation to health services. It also represented a logical conclusion to the three year phased doubling of income eligibility limits for that category begun in 1999 and completed in March 2001.</P>
      <P>Appropriate funding for 2001 has been made available with £4 million provided for the final phase of the doubling of the income eligibility limits and a further £7 million for the implementation of the budget provision. The money concerned is for the whole funding of this measure covering payment to all the service providers involved in providing services for medical card holders, for example, general practitioners, pharmacists, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Irish Medical Organisation at the beginning of March to discuss a number of issues relevant to general practice, including the introduction of automatic medical card eligibility for all persons aged 70 years and over. The discussions were both useful and informative. Prior to that meeting the Health Services Employers Agency, HSEA, had issued an invitation to the IMO to discuss the agreed implementation of the medical card extension. The IMO and Health Services Employers Agency are discussing a number of issues in regard to the GMS in general. The HSEA hopes to be in a position to respond very shortly to the IMO's issues in a manner consistent with Government pay policy and the proper long-term development of the health service. <Col N="69" /> This will facilitate progress on the agreed and timely implementation of the medical card extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at health board level chief executive officers have made no preparations for the extension of the GMS scheme to persons aged 70 years and over on the basis that under accountability legislation they are precluded from doing so prior to receiving consent from his Department? Does he accept that his approach to this issue has been wrong through his decision to make an announcement at budget time without having first secured dedicated funding, against the advice of his senior officials and without having received approval from the IMO? That is the reason we are in the mess in which we find ourselves with little prospect of the scheme being agreed and up and running by July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no negotiations prior to a budget on proposals contained within it, which represent part of broad Government policy.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical card eligibility issue was taken in tandem with all the other services the Government is providing for the elderly, particularly the over 70s. The Government is keen to do so and the budget reflected its commitment to the elderly. Additional funding was provided in the budget for this initiative.</P>
      <P>The budget decision benefits approximately 33,000 people over the age of 70 years. Up to December 2000 approximately 251,000 aged 70 years or over had medical cards. This issue is being grossly overstated and exaggerated beyond all reason. The doubling of the eligibility threshold, to which we were committed with the final phase being introduced in March, would have added another 12,000, which would have left a balance of 33,000. A total of 1.1 million have medical cards. That is the scale of what is proposed.</P>
      <P>The reaction to the decision has been overstated but, nonetheless, I am prepared to enter into discussions and consultations. The deadline of 1 July was set to allow us to enter into discussions with the IMO, not just on this issue, but on a range of other issues which the IMO has tabled for negotiation.</P>

My understanding is that the same position obtains throughout the country. No preparations have been made ahead of the commencement date of July because the Minister's officials will not give the go-ahead to health boards to do so.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the question of equity, which is supposed to be a cornerstone of the heath service? How does he explain his decision, for example, to a pensioner couple aged 66 or 67 years who are only in receipt of social welfare pensions, but above the medical card threshold? In terms of equity, a millionaire aged 70 years or over is entitled to a medical card. Yet, a couple in receipt of social welfare pensions aged under 70 years are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the UK Food Standards Agency report to which the Deputy refers. The FSAI has examined the study. The authority advises me that the study covers the period 1986 to 2000 and the conclusion from the study is that both Irish and British beef is safe and consumers should, therefore, be reassured. The study does not claim that the risk of eating BSE contaminated meat is greater in Ireland than in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. It states that while the relative likelihood for Ireland compared to Great Britain of cattle incubating BSE was 220 in 2000, this is not a direct indicator of risk to consumer health.</P>
      <P>The report states that red meat is safe and that any possible BSE infectivity is confined to specified risk material, SRM, infective tissue such as the brain and spinal cord. The report notes that the consumer had been and remains protected by the Irish SRM rules which have been in place since 1996. These tissues are removed from all animals aged over 12 months in Ireland and excluded from the human food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FSAI's scientific advisory committee has concluded that Irish consumers need to be reassured as to the safety of beef. The European Union, in its geographically based risk assessment, concluded that BSE controls in Ireland were optimally stable from 1 January 1998. The FSAI's scientific advisory committee has concluded that animals born after that date pose no risk to consumer health, as these animals would not have had access to contaminated meat and <Col N="71" /> bone meal, and, therefore, could not be incubating BSE.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the study claims that there was a greater incidence of BSE in the Irish herd because more infected cattle were slaughtered in Ireland and rules to prevent older animals from entering the food chain were only applied last year? Does the Minister of State agree that it is time to restore confidence in food safety? It is not restored by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development seeking to intimidate the chief executive of the FSAI. Does the Minister of State agree that it is time to remove any responsibility for food safety and marketing from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? Does he further agree that responsibility should be placed firmly in the hands of the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs and the Minister for Health and Children, perhaps with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for food safety being a Minister of State at both Departments? It is time that the consumer was put in the driving seat. That is the only way confidence in the industry will be fully restored, which will, in turn, benefit farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we must put the food safety agenda at the forefront. However, there is a degree of misapprehension about what is happening. The Food Safety Authority is independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and that fact is not always known. In the UK there were 900,000 cases of BSE compared with a maximum of 600 in Ireland. The study extrapolates a certain amount of material in regard to the potentiality of BSE cases in Ireland. However, when one takes into consideration the introduction of the 30 month rule, there would be no more than two cases per annum in Ireland while Great Britain might have one. That does not take account of the fact that we remove the SRM materials, the brain, spinal cord, tongue, tonsils, intestine and so forth. That reduces the risk to zero, as far as we are concerned, for cattle under 30 months of age.</P>

The equivalent figures for France and Great Britain were 52 and one, respectively. Notwithstanding what the Minister said, he has responsibility for food safety. Does he not agree that a report of this nature being published, without being counteracted or challenged, is not conducive to restoring confidence to the public?

University College, Dublin was not contacted and neither was University College, Cork or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. They are currently examining the exact figures and they believe the correct figure might be in the region of 70 to 80 rather than the 159 figure quoted by the Deputy.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the position with regard to the waiting list initiative; when it will impact on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9843/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting list initiative provides dedicated funding for a number of specified procedures in participating health board and voluntary hospitals. Orthodontic treatment is not one of the specified procedures and, therefore, does not attract waiting list initiative funding.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I accept that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, last year I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The principal elements of this initiative are the recruitment of three additional consultant orthodontists, six orthodontic specialists, three area managers, 12 nursing and nine administrative staff in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, area. In addition, a six surgery facility at Loughlinstown and a five surgery unit at St. James's Hospital are currently being equipped. A further regional orthodontic unit is being planned for the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P>As part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department also approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group has been examining this proposal and hopes to finalise it in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Validation of waiting lists is currently in progress. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists will commence training in 2001. The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists, the commissioning of four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and the validation of waiting lists. These proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce waiting times to under 12 months in the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The proposals from the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern and Western Health Boards include the use of private orthodontists, the training of three specialists in orthodontics in the Dublin Dental Hospital to commence in October 2001 and the recruitment of three additional orthodontic specialists, one senior clinical dental surgeon, four dental surgery assistants and three administrative staff. Additional sessions by health board staff and validation of waiting lists are also proposed.</P>
    <P>The impact of the initiative in these health boards will enable an additional 2,500 patients, approximately, to commence treatment. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that up to the end of February 2001, 35 patients have been referred for <Col N="74" /> treatment by the board to private orthodontists under the initiative.</P>
    <P>Overall, this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists. The health boards have advised me that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. In the longer term, this initiative &ndash; combined with the structural changes being introduced &ndash; will, I am convinced, secure the delivery of an effective orthodontic service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has taken on board my suggestion in relation to grant aid. I am surprised it is only happening on a pilot basis; it should be a national scheme. Is the Minister aware that children do not want to go to school because they are embarrassed to face their colleagues? Their parents are upset and waiting time for treatment is causing distress in many homes. Is the Minister aware that the waiting list has increased nationally? The situation is getting worse instead of better. Will the Minister consider introducing a two year scheme to pay the private sector direct grants to take people off the waiting lists? After two years the other initiative can fall into place. In the short-term, however, it will not resolve the problem. Will the Minister consider allowing people to get the work done privately by paying them a grant to that end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave this issue a great deal of time last year. Deputy Ring and Deputies from all sides of the House have tabled questions over a long period of time on the unacceptably long waiting lists in orthodontics. Certain health boards have come back with suggestions for their areas. The Western and Midland Health Boards, for example, will use private practitioners in their initiatives. With regard to the pilot project I announced for the Dublin area, it is important to let that work. I am anxious that it should be piloted as quickly as possible and I am somewhat concerned that it has taken about three months to get it off the ground. There is a working party dealing with it.</P>
      <P>One must be careful, with regard to the type of scheme one announces, about quality in the first instance and second, that public funding be ring- fenced for those most in need in terms of both clinical need and socioeconomic disadvantage. I have an open mind on the matter. I will evaluate the situation, particularly the implementation over the coming months of the various action plans put forward by the health boards. Later in the year I will seek an account of how the plans have worked in practice. If I do not see some progress by then, I will return to the drawing board and take on board some of the views put forward by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad enough for a parent to receive a letter from the health board stating that the waiting list has increased to four years, which is unacceptable. Further in the letter &ndash; I will not <Col N="75" /> name the person concerned &ndash; it is pointed out that the person will not get tooth decay or gum disease as a result of being on the waiting list and that the treatment can be done into late adulthood. That is insulting. The Minister should send a directive to the health boards that there should not be smart aleck replies from their officials. If they wish to tell people there is a four year waiting list, that is sufficient. There is no need for smart aleck replies in relation to tooth decay. The treatment might not be done in adulthood; the people will probably be old and grey by the time it is done. Will the Minister direct the health boards to stop these insulting replies being sent to parents who are waiting four years for treatment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on suicide. Many of the task force's recommendations require continuous development, particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a national suicide review group by the chief executive officers of the health <Col N="76" /> boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide and was a core recommendation of the task force report. This group was established in 1998. Membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. The main responsibilities of the group are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards. Last year, the group published its first annual report which provides a comprehensive overview of activities in suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>Health boards have established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. The working groups are multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary and engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provide information in relation to suicide and para-suicide, liaise with the media and provide training requirements for staff in relation to all aspects of suicide and para-suicide. Resource officers with responsibility for implementing recommendations of the task force have been appointed in all of the health boards. Their responsibilities include the recruitment of additional staff, the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and para-suicide.</P>
    <P>The task force also recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. A total of £830,000 has been provided by my Department in 2001 towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has been made available to further develop consultant led child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. This year an additional £100,000 has been allocated to the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork to support its work in the development of a national para-suicide register.</P>
    <P>Contact is maintained by my Department with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government with a view to implementing the task force recommendations. All the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies have also been approached by my Department requesting that the necessary measures be put in place to ensure implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
    <P>Data on mortality is routinely published in the annual and quarterly reports on vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office. Recording of the incidence of suicide by the CSO <Col N="77" /> is dependent on information set out on form 104 completed by the Garda Síochána in respect of each inquest and forwarded to the CSO. The task force proposed that a new form 104 which addresses the deficiency of the lack of detailed medical or psychiatric information relating to the deceased be completed by the Garda and a new form 104 is now in use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree with my commending the participants in last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;? They were very brave in telling their stories and gave us a better understanding of and insight into how people suffer the bereavement of suicide and what families go through. Does the Minister agree that the increase in suicide levels from approximately 60 per annum in the 1960s to an average of 450 per annum in recent years represents a serious crisis for society? Does he also agree that urgent action must be taken to introduce suicide prevention and reduction programmes, particularly among young people? Will he outline the research done by his Department into why this problem has arisen? I agree with him that it is important to examine the aims and recommendations of the task force and to have statistics on suicide but we now need a strategic, detailed plan to introduce suicide prevention and reduction programmes such as those we have seen in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with Deputy Neville. There is no question that suicide is the principal cause of death in young people, particularly those in their early 20s. It exceeds cancer and road accidents as a cause of death among young males in particular and is a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>Suicide prevention programmes are inextricably linked to mental health generally and to our attitudes to mental health. In all settings, schools, the workplace and so on, a better approach to positive mental health is essential. The concepts of counselling, psychotherapy and talking to people as well as providing facilities for people to talk to counsellors are essential if we are to lower suicide rates.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments about the participants in last night's programme. I did not see it but I have videotaped it and will watch it. <i>The Irish Times </i>also carried an excellent series of articles in recent weeks on suicide which was very informative and illuminating. It was particularly good regarding people who attempted suicide and were saved. They invariably mentioned the need to talk to someone and the fact that they could not do so at the crucial time. It was also notable that people's recovery was largely due to having people to talk to. Groups such as Grow, Aware and the Mental Health Association of Ireland are becoming increasingly important in providing a context in which people can develop better mental health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is sufficient blood available to fully meet the needs of hospitals throughout the country. This is in large measure due to the commitment and support of donors who continue to donate at blood clinics throughout the country. With effect from last Sunday, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, the IBTS, has introduced additional measures to reduce the possible risk of transmission of variant CJD through blood transfusion. The IBTS has deferred donors who have spent a cumulative total of five years or more in the UK between 1980 and 1996. This precautionary measure, which I discussed with the IBTS and the CJD advisory group, is expected to result in a reduction of 5% in donors eligible to donate amounting to a loss of approximately 7,500 donations.</P>
      <P>To make up for this shortfall in donations, the IBTS is implementing a broadly based programme to increase donations which include the following measures: a major programme to recruit new donors; to encourage lapsed donors to donate and occasional donors to increase their donations; and to improve the management of the donor programme, better media campaigns and extension of clinic opening hours. A new mobile donor team is operating in Carlow to cover the south east and a new team commenced in Ardee in March to cover the north east.</P>
      <P>Hospitals also have an important role in ensuring the appropriate use of blood and implementing effective blood stock management programmes which reduce to a minimum the level of discards of blood. I am establishing a national blood strategy implementation group to address the impact of donor deferral decisions on the blood supply, improve blood stock management throughout the health system and improve transfusion practice and blood usage. The group will comprise medical, scientific and management staff from hospitals who have been nominated by the chief executive officers of health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Representatives of the IBTS and of my Department will also be appointed to the group which will be established before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deferral of donors who resided in the UK reflects the IBTS policy of taking appropriate steps to reduce any possible risk to the blood supply that might emerge. The donor selection and donation testing programmes at the IBTS comply with EU and Council of Europe Guidelines, are as comprehensive as any in Europe and conform to existing international standards. The IBTS is also subject to inspection by the Irish Medicines Board which is the independent regulatory auth<Col N="79" /> ority for ensuring the safety and quality of blood and blood components.</P>
    <P>I record my appreciation of the support and personal efforts of donors who are no longer in a position to continue to donate because of the deferral decision. Their generosity over the years has benefited patients in our hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know that the new deferral policy is aimed at reducing the risk exposure of transmitting variant CJD by blood by up to 90%. That is the term used: &ldquo;up to 90%&rdquo;. What does that mean? Is it 50%, 60% or 70%? That is the information being given by way of briefing in the press release issued on 14 March 2001. Apparently the Minister does not know this as he is shaking his head but I have the press release here and can give him the details.</P>
      <P>The same press release states that there are 1.2 million people in Ireland eligible to give blood but have not done so. What novel steps can be taken to encourage those people to give blood, particularly as 45 operations had to be cancelled recently because of the absence of blood for transfusions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this decision was taken I met the IBTS and had a very thorough briefing from that organisation about the new measures that were to be taken. Some of those measures have been taken in recent months to increase donor supply. These include more donor friendly facilities in terms of the timing of various clinics and the establishment of new clinics. Some parts of the country do not have a track record in terms of donating blood and it is important to provide them with facilities to increase the percentage of blood donated. For example, the new donor clinic in D'Olier Street has already resulted in a very significant increase in blood supply in the Dublin area and the amount of blood donated. The new clinics in Carlow and Ardee in the north east will also increase supply. The board is looking at fixed sites on the south and north side of Dublin, perhaps attached to shopping centres, to facilitate a greater increase in the number of donors. All existing and lapsed donors have received correspondence from the BTSB inviting them to donate more blood.</P>

How have things gone so wrong, given that there is a shortage of blood, which is forecast to continue? Some 1.2 million out of a population of approximately 3.7 million have not given blood. Why did we not see this arising?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a problem for some time. Approximately 38 elective operations were cancelled in the Western Health Board area. At the same time there was a significant discard rate. The management of blood stocks is the key. With better management of existing blood stocks in hospitals and across the hospital system there would not have been a need for those cancellations. While we need to expand the donor base, it is necessary to be careful about how this is done. There are higher risks among younger donors coming on stream.</P>

The need to provide the necessary expertise &ndash; consumer, management and scientific &ndash; was the major factor which applied when appointing persons to these bodies. The advisory committee is largely scientific based and members have knowledge in this area. I appointed those recommended for their specialities.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that I have raised with him several times, both here and at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, his continued use of boards and committees of this kind to appoint people from his own bailiwick. I have specifically raised his appointments to the BTSB. Mr. Pat O'Mahony has an address in Blackrock, but I suspect he has a Cork connection. Three of the remaining seven members of the Irish Medicines Board are from Cork. Of the 12 members on the advisory committee, at least, five are from Cork.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that appointees are selected on the basis of their knowledge. Is he not aware that people from the other 25 counties have similar knowledge? Does he agree that it is a scandal that he should fill boards of this kind with appointments from his bailiwick? They are of no benefit to Fianna Fáil or his constituency colleagues. It is done for his personal benefit to groom his ego. It is the wrong thing to do with State boards and committees.</P>

      <P>With regard to five of the 12 members of the advisory committee, three are from Cork and working in University Hospital Cork or the health service. One was recommended to me by the Department. I did not seek these people to appoint them. One was appointed because of the nature of his expertise in medicinal products and psychiatry.

The third appointee is an expert in haemophilia and viscosity syndromes. I do not know what are the politics of the three people concerned. Once they had been recommended by my officials there was no reason to debar them because they worked in University College Hospital Cork.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the main board was appointed by Deputy Noonan when Minister for Health and Children. It was recommended to me that he had made a significant contribution in the chair and I reappointed him following that advice. I indicated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that another person, recently returned to the country, was appointed because of her interest in alternative health products. She is a leading figure in health advice for consumers. It is the first time the board has an appointee with a record and expertise in traditional medicinal products.</P>

      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting list figure for the Eastern Regional Health Authority has reduced by 2,955 or 15% over the period December 1999 to December 2000. The total figure for the region at 31 December 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, stood at 16,406. All of the Dublin hospitals showed reductions in numbers waiting for the period December 1999 to December 2000.</P>
      <P>A sum of £8.5 million has been made available to the Eastern Regional Health Authority under the waiting list initiative and a further £4.5 million has also been made available to the authority under the cardiac services waiting list initiative for 2001. I understand the ERHA has commissioned a number of hospitals to carry out 5,000 procedures under phase 1 of the waiting list initiative 2001, in addition to their core baseline activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the source of admissions to hospitals, figures provided to me by the ERHA show that accident and emergency admissions account for 57% of total admissions to all <Col N="84" /> hospitals in the region; however in the case of the nine hospitals which provide accident and emergency services, 70% of admissions are through the accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Overall hospital waiting list figures have gone down by almost a quarter since December 1999 and it is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <P>My concern is with the situation in the Dublin area. Would the Minister accept that the progress which has been made in reducing the waiting lists in the big Dublin hospitals has been very disappointing? He made the point about the number of admissions which are made through accident and emergency departments. Clearly there are very severe pressures on the accident and emergency departments with a resulting high demand for beds and the cancellation of elective procedures.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister's views on a few different proposals or suggestions which have been made by various people in the health services. What are his views on the adequacy of the number of acute beds in the Dublin region? What are his views on the ERHA's proposal to establish within the Dublin region a hospital which would conduct elective operations only and which would not have an accident and emergency department? What steps is he prepared to take to deal with the disincentives to gaining employment which exist in the Dublin area at present, where obviously working outside of the Dublin area is a far more attractive proposition given the lower house prices and other costs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness last year there was a recommendation that we undertake a substantial fundamental review of the bed capacity throughout the country, including the ERHA. We have undertaken that and in Phase 1 we provided funding in this year's Estimates to provide for additional capacity, both in the ERHA region and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second phase, which was the more detailed targeted speciality by speciality look at bed numbers, will come to me within the next two to three weeks. That will form the basis for action to <Col N="85" /> improve the situation regarding bed capacity in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the possibility of a proposal coming on stream regarding a hospital which would conduct elective operations only. That will receive some consideration from me. I have already received attractive proposals from Cappagh Hospital, for example, regarding centralising all orthopaedic elective procedures within its centre.</P>
    <P>The issue of incentives in the Dublin area form part of the wider partnership process and can only be looked at in the context of the PPF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated the kind of economic future which would be reserved for us if the Green Party and the policies of Mr. Douthwaite had their way. The Green Party also has some odd views about other matters which are relevant to this treaty, for example, enlargement. In 1992, in a television programme which had to do with the Maastricht Treaty, I heard Ms Patricia McKenna, an MEP of the Green Party, give the opinion that the re-unification of Germany was actually a grab by West Germany for the savings of East Germans. I am afraid that kind of extravagant and unjustified statement is typical of what the Green Party says about these issues. It is typical of what they have already said about the Nice Treaty and we heard some of that from Deputy Gormley in the House last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a curious reflection that the Green Party, the National Platform and an organisation called AfrI, which is now opposing the Nice Treaty, talk about reform of the UN. On the ideas they express in that regard, I must agree with them. They see that one of the major obstacles in getting the UN to make decisions to adopt mandates for peacekeeping, which is a live issue, is the existence of veto in the Security Council. They are quite prepared to argue, in order to increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of the UN and to expand its capacity to get justice for people around the world, that we should abolish the veto in the Security Council of the UN. When we propose the same change in the Council of Ministers of the European Union or even in the European Council, they object to it on the grounds that it is an interference with sover<Col N="87" /> eignty. I can only conclude that the reason they take this view in the UN is that they know that will probably never happen and the reason they oppose it in the European Union is that they know there is a serious risk that it might happen and that we might one day be able to put the European Union in a position to be a great deal more effective than it is today in dealing with the issues of concern to us.</P>
    <P>This treaty will be put to a referendum here, but I do not believe it is necessary to hold it at the end of May for a number of reasons. First, we do not have to ratify the treaty until the end of 2002. There is, therefore, no hurry to do so. We should allow enough time for a full public debate. Second, we must do everything possible to give the lie to the spurious assertion being made by opponents of the treaty, including the Green Party, that the debate is in some way being rushed. Third, I am not at all sure of the wisdom of conducting the kind of widespread public debate we would like to see in circumstances where we are restricted by the necessary measures to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. Fourth, we need to give the lie to another utterly disingenuous assertion by the Green Party, that those who favour ratification of this treaty wish to conspire in muddying the waters by putting four questions to the people at the same time. Nothing could be further from the truth. If the public hear that kind of assertion being made by the Green Party or The National Platform, they should realise it is empty and mendacious rhetoric.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should hold four referendums on the same day. There is no urgency about at least two of the referendums proposed and the one on the International Criminal Court could stand on its own. It is entirely unwise of the Government to propose we hold those four referendums on the same day.</P>
    <P>The case for the ratification of the Nice Treaty is so abundantly clear and unanswerable it deserves to stand alone, to be considered alone and to be ratified alone. The Green Party persists on dragging in every conceivable red herring into this debate. I read in the March edition of <i>The Irish Family</i>&ndash; I think it is a Roman Catholic newspaper published in Mullingar &ndash; that Patricia McKenna, MEP, stated that &ldquo;It seems that the Government, with the apparent support of the two main Opposition Parties, will go to any length to divert attention from the contents of the Treaty of Nice&rdquo;. She did not say much about the content, but that is what she claimed. The Government's decision to publish a White Paper on the treaty hardly sits with an attempt to &ldquo;divert attention from the content of the Treaty of Nice&rdquo;. The extent of the debate that took place in public here during the course of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference was hardly an attempt to divert attention from the content of the treaty. The lie is given to the claim of Patricia McKenna, MEP, by the fact that she popped up <Col N="88" /> so often in the debate during the course of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley spoke on the same subject here last night. He spoke about the White Paper. He said that on close reading it is about as neutral as this country. He said the White Paper &ldquo;is extremely dodgy in light of the McKenna judgment&rdquo;. I challenge the Deputy and every other member of his party, all of ten of them whoever they are, to explain in what way the White Paper is biased or presents an unreal picture of the Nice Treaty. I read it and I am no great friend of the Government, but it is fair to say, and I say it without hesitation, that the White Paper gives a fair and honest picture of what has been agreed in the Nice Treaty. It gives a fair and honest picture of the Government's concerns coming up to and during the course of the debate. I am not saying I agree with everything that came out of it, but the White Paper is what it sets out to be and is in keeping with the tradition we have always had in this country of having fair and accurate White Papers. When it comes to statements of Government policy, it is different, we can argue. I challenge the Deputy and his colleagues in the Green Party to come in here and substantiate their outrageous claim that this White Paper is in any way biased.</P>
    <P>The stupidity of the opposition is underlined even further in an article by Mr. Anthony Coghlan of The National Platform in the newspaper to which I referred. He states that the arguments that the Treaty of Nice is necessary for enlarging the EU is &ldquo; . . . a poor argument, as only eight of the 80 or so pages of the Nice Treaty in the EU Official Journal relate to the issue of EU Enlargement&rdquo;. That is typical of the kind of nonsense expressed by opponents of this treaty. When I read that I went back through the treaty and found that it bears no relation whatsoever to the facts. I can find 15 pages in the Official Journal that are formal pages, the recitals, the signatures and so on. The great bulk of what is in the treaty is required by the process of enlargement, but if the opponents of this treaty have to resort to the argument of counting pages to decide how strong the argument is, I can only conclude they know, as they must by now, that they have no case for the extraordinary claims they make. That is typical of the Green Party and The National Platform.</P>
    <P>The Green Party and The National Platform &ndash; I am sure there will be others &ndash; also claim the people were duped at the time of the Amsterdam Treaty because we had a referendum on the Good Friday Agreement on the same day. I do not know whether Deputy Gormley spends his time talking to particularly stupid people, but I certainly found no evidence among the people at the time that they were in any way confused between the Amsterdam Treaty and the Good Friday referendum, but that is not the only claim the Deputy makes. He said last night &ndash; I am subject to correction on the Official Report and if the Deputy would like to come in and change it <Col N="89" /> all, I will help him &ndash; that we have been continuously misled, we were misled in 1970, in 1987, in 1992 and in 1997, we have been misled about every single treaty, when the people who opposed those treaties deliberately tried to mislead people by claiming the treaties did things they did not do. If they were right in what they said about successive treaties, we would not have national independence, thousands of Irish people would have been brought back in body bags from foreign wars, we would have no sovereignty, our economy would be in tatters, we would have no culture, etc. They have come out time and time again with the same niggling, nit-picking entirely mendacious arguments because there is no foundation for the kinds of claims they make about these treaties as to their interference with our sovereignty and with our capacity to make decisions for ourselves. All they can say is that we were duped or we were cheated.</P>
    <P>There is a claim that the rapid reaction force constitutes a militarisation of the European Union. That is utterly without foundation. That is an agreement, a method, a piece of machinery that is being put in place to give effect to the Petersberg Tasks, to make it possible for the European Union to carry out those Petersberg Tasks in which I hope this country will fully participate, but in which I know this country legally, constitutionally and under the terms of the treaties will participate only if the Government decides it wants to do so. It will be a sovereign decision of the Government and one I hope we will take on every occasion the European Union identifies such a task, as there is a need for this and, unfortunately, there will continue to be a need for it, probably in the Balkans, for a long time into the future.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out last evening, that we are the only country that has the intention of holding a referendum on this treaty. The Danes who are most notoriously jealous of their national sovereignty have concluded they do not need to have a referendum on this treaty because it does not involve the surrender of any extra sovereignty over and above what has already been agreed as a pooling of sovereignty in the treaties as they exist up to now. That is something The National Platform and the Green Party should put in their pipes and smoke. I hope we will not see them carrying out this nonsensical exercise of bringing over here failed political entities from Denmark during the course of this referendum campaign to tell us how we should vote and that they will avoid the temptation of bringing over discredited Tory euro sceptics from the UK to give us lessons from the depths of their difficulties about how we should vote on European issues.</P>
    <P>The claims that have been made that the changes in voting arrangements and in qualified majority voting in this treaty constitute a grab for power by Germany and France are clearly shown to be spurious. If we look at the implications of this treaty for the balance in voting rights <Col N="90" /> between member states in the context of enlargement we find the change is very little indeed. That is not what the opponents of the treaty will say. It would become marginally more difficult to secure a qualified majority vote in the union of 27 than in the union of 15. It is wrong to see that as a naked grab for power by France and Germany. I cannot believe that those who make that claim really believe it. If they do, they are ripe for duping and will believe almost anything. There is no foundation for that claim and there is no reason we should object to the change.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Gormley last night deploring the fact that in 30 new areas of policy, because the European Council has adopted the principle of qualified majority voting in those areas, we have damaged ourselves by losing our veto. I invite Deputy Gormley, who seems to be a reasonable person, except on these issues, to reflect on what a veto is and on what he says about the UN. A veto is a power which one can use to prevent others doing things one wants to do oneself. It is also a means by which one state can prevent a majority from doing things which the rest of us support. There is a far bigger danger and obstacle to us in what we want to do in the European Union in other countries having a veto over what we might agree to do than there is an opportunity for us to stop other people doing things of which we disapprove.</P>
    <P>The approach being taken to this treaty by the opponents of it is insular, inward looking and lacks self-confidence. I cannot believe that they really believe it in their hearts. They may think they are doing some service to democratic discussion by putting up an opposition but it should be an opposition founded on fact and not such as we have seen from the National Platform and the Green Party.</P>

      <P>I am very happy as Minister for Finance to be here today to speak in this debate on the Treaty of Nice. The people of Ireland will have the opportunity to vote on this treaty in the upcoming referendum. We are the only member state in which a referendum is being held on the treaty. I have no doubt that the people will support the treaty and thereby support the next stage in the Union's development. This Union is our Union and we all must take our share of the responsibility for its further development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is the result of an intergovernmental conference which began early last year and which concluded with the negotiations at the Nice European Council last December. The Intergovernmental Conference was set the task of dealing with what were termed &ldquo;the Amsterdam leftovers&rdquo;. These leftovers were <Col N="91" /> the major institutional reforms within the Union needed to cope with an enlarged Union which had not been resolved as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The institutional changes were successfully agreed at Nice.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Treaty of Nice is to make the changes necessary to prepare the Union for enlargement. It succeeds in doing this by guaranteeing that a Union of 27 members will be in a position to operate effectively while at the same time making sure that the essential safeguards for smaller countries remain in place.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the enlargement process. Our perspective on enlargement is very much informed by our positive experiences of EU membership. We can understand, possibly more than most because of our history and development, the hopes that the applicant states invest in their accession to the European Union. We welcome the diversity and strength which enlargement will bring to the EU as a whole and to all its individual member states.</P>
    <P>In promoting the growth and development of the Union we are also promoting our own national interest. The Union has been good for Ireland and the Irish people know that this is so. On all previous occasions they have endorsed the various stages in the development of the Union through the referendum process. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. Enlargement will provide opportunities for Ireland to deepen our relations, both political and economic, with the candidate countries, many of which are of a similar size to ourselves.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of some of the very tangible economic and financial benefits we have drawn from the Union later in this speech. I will also remind it of just some of the benefits that we might be more inclined, at times, to take for granted. Free access to the Single Market of the Union is probably the greatest economic benefit we draw from the Union. As a small and very open trading economy it is vital that we preserve and strengthen this access.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the Single Market by over 100 million new consumers will create many new customers for our goods and services. Our exporters will have access to a single market with more than 500 million people. Our ability to export into the Single Market is a prime attraction for the many foreign firms that have established their operations here in Ireland and our attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment can only be enhanced by the increase in the Single Market which will result from enlargement. The already impressive level of Irish investment in the candidate countries by companies such as Allied Irish Banks and Cement Roadstone Holdings will also be facilitated further in what are now rapidly expanding economies.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I naturally welcome these developments, but besides expanding the market we are also deepening the market to <Col N="92" /> further facilitate trade within the market area. Perhaps the most visible sign of this will be the introduction in Ireland and across 11 of the other member states of the euro currency notes and coins from the beginning of next year. Membership of the euro has brought other benefits too. The convergence criteria carefully laid down at Maastricht ensured that all participating states kept deficits, inflation and interest rates tightly controlled, measures which facilitated the healthy development of our public finances, while providing a stable environment for business.</P>
    <P>I shall talk later about the Structural Funds in general. At this point it is timely that we remind ourselves of the significant financial contribution the European Union has made to the peace process on this island, first, by contributing to the International Fund for Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1986 and, second, following the ceasefires in 1994, by its support for the Border region and Northern Ireland through the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Deputies might like to know that by the end of this year the first EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation will have pumped £106 million into the economy of the Border region. The Northern Ireland economy will have received support of over £450 million from the same programme. Some £80 million will have been spent in the six years to the end of 2001 on supported cross-Border co-operative initiatives. Similar levels of funding have been committed by the EU to the second programme which will run until the end of 2004. Under the EU's community initiatives programmes a new Ireland-Northern INTERREG programme is expected to begin operations later this year. In all, it will contribute over 170 million euro to the border regions, North and South, by the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I was keen to ensure that Ireland's right to determine its own policy in the area of taxation would not be affected by any treaty changes agreed in Nice. This objective was successfully achieved. All decisions in this area will continue to be made by unanimous voting procedures.</P>
    <P>Second, there was a satisfactory outcome regarding the Commission. Starting with the next Commission, the five big states have given up their right to nominate a second Commissioner. It will be one Commissioner per state. When we reach 27 &ndash; this could be a decade or more away &ndash; there will be a rotation system. An important achievement in Nice was agreement that this will be on the basis of strict equality. In other words, an Irish Commissioner will serve on exactly the same basis as a French or German Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Third, as part of the deal for giving up their second Commissioner, the larger states have had their voting weight increased. Ireland's voting weight is only marginally affected and remains the same as Finland and Denmark. In addition, an important safeguard agreed at Nice is that decisions must have the support of a majority of <Col N="93" /> member states. This is a valuable protection for smaller states.</P>
    <P>The outcome on the European Parliament was also satisfactory. With 12 seats we will continue to have a better ratio of seats to population than any existing member state except Luxembourg. Another gain was that the right of each member state to nominate a judge to the Court of Justice has been confirmed in the treaty for the first time.</P>
    <P>As regards common foreign and security policy, the Nice Treaty includes some limited necessary updating of provisions for putting into effect the decisions on humanitarian and crisis management tasks agreed at Amsterdam. There is no departure from the firm commitment, in line with the Government's policy of neutrality, that Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval. Any effort to suggest otherwise would be totally misleading. An objective assessment of the relatively limited changes proposed by the Nice Treaty must be that Ireland has nothing to fear and much to gain from equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, Ireland's membership of the European Union has been an extremely positive experience. The most direct benefits of EU membership in the popular perception are the transfers from the Common Agricultural Policy and from the Structural and Cohesion Funds. EU Structural and Cohesion Funds have made a contribution to our outstanding economic performance over the past decade or more, but I might add that these funds, while helpful, have not substituted in restructuring our fiscal balance over the past 15 years. For the 1989 to 1993 and 1994 to 1999 programming periods we received 11 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds. In the 2000-06 programming period, Ireland will receive some 4 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds. This is a manifestation of the Community commitment to consolidate our achievements of the previous rounds of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The EU is currently engaged in the process which will see the enlargement of the Union to embrace 12 other member states. This historic development will transform the EU and fulfil the Union's destiny of securing and extending peace and prosperity in Europe. For the existing member states it presents many economic opportunities and, it must be said, not a few challenges. It can be envisaged that EU membership, while not without some significant challenges for the prospective member states, will also spur their economic development.</P>
    <P>In this short contribution to the debate I have concentrated on economic and financial dimensions. However, we have gained enormously in many other areas of life &ndash; political, social, cultural, etc. &ndash; from being in the Union. I have no doubt the Irish people appreciate this reality and will view the Nice Treaty as providing for a further strengthening of the Union from which <Col N="94" /> we have benefited so much. It is because of this that I am confident the people will express their appreciation by strongly approving the treaty in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001. The purpose of the Bill is to seek the agreement of the people to the constitutional changes necessary to allow the State ratify the Nice Treaty which was signed by the 15 Foreign Ministers of the European Union on 26 February.</P>
      <P>The decision to have a referendum is based on the clear legal advice that ratification of the treaty by the State requires constitutional change. What is involved is the updating and consolidation of the rules governing enhanced co-operation, the introduction on a limited basis of enhanced co-operation in the area of the common foreign and security policy and the extension of the scope of qualified majority voting. It is important to avoid any risk of legal uncertainty on matters of such importance to the State as the treaties establishing the Community and the European Union.</P>
      <P>The treaty will only come into effect if ratified by all 15 member states. When ratified the measures adopted will equip the Union to function effectively with a significant increase in membership and at the same time provide the required protection for this country's essential interests. It is intended to prepare the way for a significant enlargement of the Union.</P>
      <P>The European Union is continuing to seek ways of playing a greater role in peace, stability and security in Europe and Ireland has a strong interest in maintaining a stable, inclusive security environment. It is essential for Ireland to be centrally involved in shaping future changes in the direction we would wish to see them take. Ireland pursues this objective not only through the common foreign policy of the EU but also through the primary role of the United Nations and other international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the common foreign and security policy under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty has led to an enhancement of the capacity of the EU to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks, known as the Petersberg Tasks. Existing security arrangements and procedures have been adapted to carry out these tasks and Ireland is actively and constructively participating in improving European responses to challenges which can arise. Important steps have been taken in developing an EU capability to undertake crisis management tasks. Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg Tasks will be a sovereign decision by the Government and approached on a case by case basis. Also, in line with the Government's policy of military neutrality, the Government has made clear that Ireland would only participate in operations authorised by the United Nations in <Col N="95" /> accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval.</P>
    <P>The existing treaty provisions were intended to make the common foreign and security policy of the EU more coherent, more visible and more effective. The Nice Treaty has made only limited changes in this area. References to the Western European Union have been deleted. At the time of the Amsterdam Treaty it was envisaged that the Western European Union would play a key role, acting on behalf of the EU in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention. However, given the development of the Union's capabilities in this area, the role of the Western European Union has diminished. The deletion of the clauses concerning the Western European Union can therefore be seen in the light of the evolution of the European security and defence policy and of a desire to update the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty also provides for the replacement of the existing political committee, which comprised representatives from the capitals, by a political and security committee based in Brussels operating on instructions from the respective Governments. The new committee will assume functions relating to the conduct of the common foreign and security policy. As part of its responsibilities, the political and security committee may exercise, under the authority of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>I would now like to respond to points raised by Deputy Gormley in relation to security and defence issues. In his comments the Deputy raised a number of points which I would particularly like to address. He said that NATO refers to four countries &ndash; Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden &ndash; as &ldquo;former neutrals&rdquo;. I am not aware of this description being used for the four members of the European Union which are not members of the alliance. If used, however, it would be completely misleading. None of these countries is a member of a military alliance and as such they are not party to any mutual defence guarantee. Like Ireland, they are making a positive contribution to European security and defence policy. They, like Ireland, want Europe to be in a better position to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks. They, like Ireland, are not neutral when it comes to playing a role in peacekeeping and reconstruction after the terrible events in the Balkans over the past decade. They, like us, do not want an impotent Europe that has no capacity to provide humanitarian assistance for a crisis on the EU's doorstep.</P>
    <P>I see no contradiction between neutrality and Ireland's involvement in Europe's work to promote peace and stability. To say, as Deputy Gormley said, that Ireland has &ldquo;sold out big time on neutrality&rdquo; is just irresponsible scaremongering. Having questioned our neutrality, I was even more surprised to hear Deputy Gormley raise questions about the deletion of clauses <Col N="96" /> about the Western European Union in the Nice Treaty. Given the concerns he has expressed in the past on Ireland's observer status with Western European Union, I would have thought that deletion of these clauses might represent a positive development for him.</P>
    <P>The limited changes in the Nice Treaty amount to an updating of the treaty to take account of the evolution of European security and defence policy. It was the Amsterdam Treaty which defined a role for the EU in relation to peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. In short, the basis for this work is the Amsterdam Treaty. The changes in the Nice Treaty reflect the reality that the European Union and not the Western European Union will implement the decisions it may take in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley asked why Ireland does not negotiate a protocol exempting itself from security and defence. In making this suggestion is he seriously suggesting that Ireland should opt out, ostrich like, from playing a role in promoting peace and stability in Europe? This is not an area of policy where we should seek to isolate ourselves. Ireland will continue to play a positive and constructive role in keeping with our long standing involvement in peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Turning to the political and security committee, I would point out to Deputy Gormley that the creation of this committee is intended to provide a direct political control over the military dimension of any crisis management operation. Moreover, the EU can only decide on any operation on the basis of unanimity among its 15 member states. It is absurd to suggest that the responsibilities of the political and security committee include waging war. Once again, the Deputy is simply scaremongering.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of the command of the EU operation being put into the hands of NATO. The EU will always make the decision as to who would command any particular operation. Moreover, in accordance with the Treaty of Nice, the political and security committee, under the authority of the foreign ministers, would have political control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley seems to have a fixation about the military aspects of European security and defence policy. It is much wider in scope than the development of military capabilities. In evolving its policy in this area, the EU is working on developing a range of instruments, including conflict prevention and work on the civilian aspects of crisis management. We are currently devoting a great deal of time and effort, for instance, in regard to policing and in the definition of concrete targets in the civilian crisis management area.</P>
    <P>He implies that Ireland might take part in an EU operation without a UN mandate. First of all, if Deputy Gormley reads the conclusions of recent European Council meetings, he will see that the centrality of the UN is explicitly recognised by the EU.</P>
    <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated <Col N="97" /> position in this area, I would reiterate that Ireland will approach each mission on a case-by-case basis, and only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954 the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. This principle is at the core of our approach to any such participation.</P>
    <P>Another area where Deputy Gormley appears confused is in relation to Ireland's commitment to the Headline Goal, or Rapid Reaction Force. Last November a number of meetings were held in Brussels which centred on the Capabilities Commitment Conference. The conference chiefly provided the opportunity for EU member states, including Ireland, to indicate formally the resources they can make available for potential humanitarian or crisis management operations. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary Headline Goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki in 1999.</P>
    <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued after the conference which outlined progress to date on the elaboration of the voluntary goal in the lead-up to the Nice European Council. It clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European army.</P>
    <P>It is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it is a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks. In summary, Ireland's contribution of up to 850 members of our Defence Forces does not affect our long-standing policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed. Nor is any mutual defence arrangement involved.</P>
    <P>I hope these explanations will put Deputy Gormley's mind at rest. I assure him that neutrality is not in danger, and Ireland will continue to play a positive role in keeping with our long-standing tradition in peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Irish people are generous and outward-looking. They want the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to have the same opportunities we have had in a safe secure environment. This makes sense for Europe and it makes sense for Ireland. An objective assessment of the relatively limited changes proposed by the Treaty of Nice must be that Ireland has nothing to fear, and much to gain, from equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead. As a country which has benefited and which continues to benefit greatly from Community membership, it is in our interests that the Union can operate and take decisions, even with a larger membership.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. We in Ireland have demonstrated over the past three decades that we are fully capable of adapting and taking advantage of the benefits and opportunities which full participation in the European <Col N="98" /> Union has offered us. Change holds no fear for us.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited enormously through being at the forefront of the European Union, economically, politically and socially. The Irish people have consistently rejected those who have argued for an inward, introvert vision, based on a lack of confidence in the capacity of the Irish people to advance their interests successfully in the European environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a model for many newly-acceding countries, as a country where membership of the Union has been invaluable in promoting economic growth, employment and social development.</P>
    <P>Enlargement will extend benefits to the new group of members, while offering opportunities to the current membership. I am confident the Irish people want to help these new countries succeed in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Our record as a nation is one of generosity, not mean-spiritedness. I know that we will not turn our backs on the candidate countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Billy Timmins. I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak about the Nice Treaty. I am a completely committed European. I am proud that I chaired the Joint Beef and Veal Committee in Europe for a period of five years in my earlier life. I am old enough to remember what rural Ireland was like before Ireland joined the European Community in the early 1970s. I remember the 1960s and the flight from the land and all the problems associated with that. My own parish of Aghabog was nearly desolate.</P>
      <P>A peaceful and stable Europe is clearly to Ireland's advantage. Small countries in particular benefit from a settled international order. In an open economy like Ireland's, it is vital to underpin our domestic economic wellbeing. The EU comprises 15 member states. We have come a long way from two world wars and certainly, the European Union has done much to maintain that peaceful situation.</P>
      <P>I was lucky enough to visit Berlin in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I went through Checkpoint Charlie to see what it was like on the other side. It was a great day when the Berlin Wall came down and it is good to be able to visit East Berlin since then and see the changes in the way of life that have been brought about.</P>
      <P>We now have access to a market of 370 million people. Enlargement will bring that over the years to 550 million. That is an opportunity, not a hindrance, for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a major job to sell the Treaty of Nice. We often try to evade the fact that much of the benefits that politicians and Ministers hand out come from Europe. As a result, many ordinary people fail to recognise the full advantages of Ireland being one of the member states of the European Union. Many people seemed to agree with the Minister for Finance's <Col N="99" /> attitude to the EU, when he shook his fist at them. Events like that will make it more difficult to get ordinary voters out to vote on an issue that they may not fully understand. It certainly is not in Ireland's interest to vote down this treaty. That the Government is giving the people an opportunity to vote on the treaty is to be welcomed and full use should be made of that.</P>
    <P>The McKenna judgment means that it can be somewhat difficult for ordinary people to take in all the facts. The Taoiseach and his Ministers will have a major task to ensure that the issues are fully understood and that we get the right result. There will be full support from this side of the House but it is up to the Government to lead. It is only necessary to look at the standing of Ireland since our entry to the EU. We are now a strong nation. We are one of the 15 members and regardless of what party was in power in recent years, the Taoiseach and his Ministers chaired EU affairs well when necessary and received good feedback. Our civil servants have done us proud also and we have nothing to be afraid of. The full membership of the European Union gave Ireland an extraordinary boost.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has mentioned some of the financial gains we have made. While the International Fund for Ireland was only a small European fund, it was very important at the time Dr. Garret FitzGerald signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was a help for the Border region which suffered as a result of the 30 years of the Troubles. That region did not attract the foreign investment it might otherwise have done. The IFI which was a fully European fund, and more recently the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, were important and played a major role. We still need that investment, especially in my county of Monaghan where we have not had foreign investment or high-tech industry for many years. I do not apologise for saying that this is an issue the Government must treat seriously.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has gained significantly from membership of the European Union. There are problems due to BSE, foot and mouth and other factors. We cannot ignore the benefits of the CAP and the funding received for agriculture. Some would say we would have been better outside Europe but how many farmers would we have lost? It is necessary to visit Poland or Hungary to see how they have fared. I visited Poland in 1999 to see the type of farming undertaken there. The situation there brings to mind that in Ireland before we joined Europe. Poland has a long way to go before it is brought within the EU, but it's people are working enthusiastically towards that goal. I visited Hungary last year and there were major problems there also. Ireland has achieved a minimum wage and the Hungarians were delighted to announce to us when the Irish delegation arrived there that they had also got a minimum wage of £200. It sounded reasonably good until we were advised it was £200 per <Col N="100" /> month. We should be proud of some of the gains we have made since entering the EU but we will have competition from the eastern countries in terms of jobs and opportunities for European and other firms when they join the EU.</P>
    <P>The major benefits of EU membership are clearly seen in Ireland in water schemes, the road network and education. It was my job as a young child to go with a bucket to the spout to get water. There was no running water and there were no toilets. In 1963, when a survey was done on my home parish, there was only one bathroom at farm level and that was built by people from outside this country.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to be thankful to the EU for. Membership, with work towards a consensus among parties in this House in the late 1980s and early 1990s, has moved us forward. It is vital that we pass this treaty and ensure the continuation of our role in Europe. There will be differences. It is only common sense that if we are part of an enlarged EU, there will be changes to make it workable.</P>
    <P>There are still major problems with illegal drugs. It was in the last Government's period in office that drugs became a European issue. Recently, we have had success in this area but we must use our influence within the EU to ensure that community-wide mechanisms are used to tackle the issue in conjunction with other police forces. These mechanisms should also be used against those who can attack the State in other ways as evidenced by the recent threat to agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to acknowledge that things have improved since Deputy Crawford collected the water with a bucket. Regrettably, there are still areas where people are neglected, particularly elderly people who do not have basic sanitary facilities. Successive Ministers for the Environment and Health, and virtually all local authorities, have failed people in this area. I do not know if there is a role for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in this area. Perhaps there is, as there are many elderly, vulnerable people who are not capable of filling out a form for essential repairs grants. We have no pro-active structure in place to identify these people and to improve services for them. Perhaps the Minister will build an extra wing to his Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972, in the referendum vote on accession to the European Community, the turnout was just over 70% and the result was 83% for and 17% against. Some 26 years later, there was a turnout of 56% for the Treaty of Amsterdam vote, with <Col N="101" /> 60% for and 40% against. Nobody can dispute that economically we have benefited greatly over the past three decades and it is impossible to paint a picture of how we might be if we had stayed outside the EU. Interaction with our neighbours has also assisted us to adopt a more humane attitude as our insular outlook was put on the backburner.</P>
    <P>Membership has been good for us and yet, as illustrated by the comparison of 1972 and 1998, the percentage voter turnout is decreasing and the gap between Yes and No is narrowing. Now that the silver has been received from the rich granny, we are preparing to move on. Are those who have been anti-EU for a number of years taking misplaced solace from the percentage of No voters? I hope that we do not become the praying mantis of Europe. I appreciate that some have an ideological difficulty with our position, but it is less than honourable that others may vote against further integration merely because the time for taking is over and this country must now start giving.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EU is not simply about giving or taking but very often it is depicted as so. This, the 24th amendment to the Constitution, is required to enable the State to ratify the Treaty of Nice and to add new subsections to the Constitution to provide for the treaty. The Nice treaty is a continuation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and it makes way for enlargement of the EU. Subject to the satisfactory completion of the accession negotiations with the applicant countries, this development will have a knock-on effect for the EU in several areas of its business, including the weighting of votes on the Council, qualified majority voting and other institutional changes. In addition, the treaty contains provisions relating to enhanced co-operation that may take place between groups of member states. It has been difficult to reach agreement on several aspects of how the EU should move forward and very often these are parked for a period and revisited at a later stage. This is a healthy process and by its nature it is slow and cumbersome.</P>
    <P>With 15 members, an additional 12 members awaiting entry and 30 obtaining candidate status there is concern that the institutions will become bogged down if the composition and administration follow along current lines. At present the ten smaller states nominate one Commissioner each and the five larger nominate two each. At the appointment of the next Commission in 2005 the five larger countries will forego their second nomination and each member state will nominate one, up to 27 members. The Council will then decide by unanimity on the size of the Commission and membership from then on will be based on equal rotation among member states. The Treaty of Nice also increases the powers of the President of the Commission. The Commission will have the authority to decide on the internal organisation, portfolios may be reallocated during its term and, subject to Commission <Col N="102" /> approval, a member of the Commission may be required to resign.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that Commissioners are not there to represent member states. While we are all familiar with a passage from a recently published book which refers to wearing the green jersey when in Brussels, it is important to realise that in theory the Commission represents the Community. The extent of the truth of this will become apparent in the coming years. I hope it proves to be the case.</P>
    <P>There will be a reweighting of the Council votes. Ireland will have seven votes out of 345 in a Union of 27 members. This is equivalent to 2.03% of the total vote and contrasts with our percentage of the EU population which will stand at 0.8%, assuming a membership of 27. We will have parity of voting with Denmark, Finland, Lithuania and Slovakia. Germany, Britain, France and Italy will have 29 while Malta will have 23 at the bottom of the scale. There will also be changes in the percentage of vote required to adopt a decision.</P>
    <P>There will be an extension of the areas where qualified majority voting applies. However, there will be a requirement for unanimity in some areas. One such area for Ireland will be taxation. The Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs used this as a battle won to downplay the perceived potential loss of influence with the change in the make up of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Another key aspect of the treaty is enhanced co-operation. This refers to specific provisions introduced into the Treaty of Amsterdam which allow groups of member states, fewer than the entire membership, to avail of the institutions to promote closer co-operation between themselves. To date, these have not been used. A formula is now being drawn up to facilitate this enhanced co-operation. This co-operation cannot undermine the Single Market, constitute a barrier to trade or distort competition between member states.</P>
    <P>Some minor changes have been made in the area of common foreign and security policy. These, in the main, involve the enhancement of the capability to carry out the humanitarian and crisis management tasks known as the Petersberg Tasks. Participation by Ireland in any of the Petersberg Tasks will be a sovereign decision by the Government and will be approached on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Treaty of Nice is to cater for enlargement. Since the fall of the Berlin wall and the emergence of democracies in eastern Europe it has been clear that the EU would have to redefine its role. Many of these countries needed the support of a larger bloc and most are now where we were 30 years ago. The opportunity of EU membership has strengthened democracy in most of these evolving countries. It will also play a part in dealing with old and new sores. The stalemate on the island of Cyprus is a case in point. While Turkey has only candidate status it is important to realise that membership <Col N="103" /> of the EU for Cyprus with the potential membership of Turkey will help to resolve this bitter problem and assist people to understand better each other's needs.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest achievements of the EU is the stability it has brought to Europe. One of my greatest regrets is the amount of misinformation put out during the course of this and other EU debates. There is no point in giving those who disseminate this misinformation any oxygen. Despite many prophets of doom their predictions have not come to pass. Some politicians and commentators play on the fears of some and often create them. I have come to the conclusion that, in some cases, opposition may be less than genuine and is being used for political short-term gain. I appreciate that the McKenna judgment must be taken into consideration but I hope the national broadcasting authority, when it gets around to giving air time to this debate, will find a broad range of people to make contributions. It strikes me that a small number of people use this debate for self-promotion and not to point out the real issues.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Finance, Defence and Social, Community and Family Affairs have spoken in this debate. My old politics lecturer from UCG, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, made the point that we look upon everything as a market or a balance sheet. I hope the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will make a contribution and address the cultural aspects of the treaty. There is more to our membership of the EU than economics. A UN High Commissioner recently made the point that many Irish politicians try to make political capital from the fears and concerns of a small number of people. We must examine the broader aspects of our role in Europe and look at how we can teach as well as learn</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Timmins said about giving oxygen to some of the opponents of the treaty. The small minority who oppose the treaty seem to get more air time than those who support it. Coverage tends not to be proportionate but I suppose that is the price of having a free press and a democratic political system. It is important that the proportions of those who support and oppose the treaty be emphasised in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Treaty of Nice is to make the necessary changes to prepare the Union for enlargement. The Government is strongly committed to an enlarged and strengthened Europe. <Col N="104" /> The treaty ensures that a Union of 27 members will be in a position to operate effectively while making sure the essential safeguards for smaller countries remain in place.</P>
    <P>As a country which has and continues to benefit greatly from Community membership, it is in our interests that the Union can operate and make decisions even with a larger membership. Ireland is particularly well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. The Single Market will expand to over 500 million people. The opportunities for all our people are starkly obvious.</P>
    <P>Ireland has much to learn and much to contribute from the sharing of ideas in the field of social protection as developed in the Treaty of Nice. The benefits of EU membership from a social protection perspective has been underpinned by EU legislation and, just as importantly, co-operation in the field of social policy development. Membership of the EU has meant that Ireland has benefited from the effects of the optimum allocation of labour which is underpinned by one of the four freedoms on which the single European market is based &ndash; the free movement of workers.</P>
    <P>Protection of social security rights is essential to achieve this objective. EU regulations provide protection for the social security rights of workers moving between the various member states which is among the best in the world. Given the high proportion of its population living outside Ireland this degree of social security protection for migrant workers is of particular importance for this country and its people.</P>
    <P>Legislation is also being developed to protect the rights of migrant workers under occupational and personal pension schemes. The Government and I are strongly committed to advancing these measures. EU directives provide for equal treatment for men and women in both statutory schemes, with some exceptions, and occupational social security schemes. This means that no state can gain a competitive advantage by discriminating on the grounds of gender. Ireland provides for the full equal treatment and does not avail of the exceptions permitted in this directive, which applies to statutory schemes. Further EU action continues through programmes to promote equal opportunities for men and women.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Lisbon in March 2000 agreed to adopt an integrated approach to the development of policy in the economic, employment and social areas in what is being termed the &ldquo;policy triangle&rdquo;. This envisages that each policy area needs to support and reinforce the others at both national and EU levels. This approach is reflected in the strategic goal for the EU set at Lisbon which is to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. This goal is to apply for the next decade.</P>
    <P>Social cohesion is now included as part of the overall goal for the EU on an equal footing with <Col N="105" /> economic growth and employment. Irish policy development fully reflects this approach, not least in the partnership process.</P>
    <P>The European Union, through the Structural Funds, the Common Agricultural Policy, the operation of the Single Market and economic and monetary union has made a major contribution to Ireland's economic development. Employment growth, in turn, has made available greatly increased resources to significantly improve our levels of social protection, to tackle poverty and social exclusion and thus generally improve the overall quality of life for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the huge reduction in unemployment achieved by economic growth and by the employment policies devised in co-operation with other member states has released the resources which can be targeted on our older people and persons with disabilities and on improving the employability of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>EU member states have demonstrated over the years that it is possible to achieve high levels of economic development and employment and also have a high level of social protection. These realities are reflected in the European Union's strong commitment to adequate social protection and to combating social exclusion which are written into the treaty.</P>
    <P>It is left to individual member states, however, to decide on overall levels of social protection and on how their systems should be organised and financed. There is a clear need to take special measures in a systematic and co-ordinated way to combat social exclusion and poverty. Ireland, sharing the overall EU commitment to social protection, has led the way in establishing a national anti-poverty strategy in 1997 and we were the first EU country to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a basis in the EU treaty to legislate in these areas, but this is subject to unanimity. Unanimity is difficult to achieve when systems differ so much and huge resources are involved.</P>
    <P>A new approach, known as open co-ordination, was agreed by the European Council in Lisbon last year. This involves agreement being reached on objectives in a particular policy area, with member states being largely free to decide on how to meet these objectives in the context of their own systems.</P>
    <P>Experiences, ideas, research findings and good practice are then shared, with a view to member states drawing on this pool of knowledge and experience to more effectively modernise their systems on an ongoing basis. Under this approach the diversity of systems is a positive advantage as there is a more varied experience from which to draw.</P>
    <P>Already under this process member states are committed to drawing up national action plans on social inclusion based on agreed objectives, which are to be brought forward by June 2001; a project on safe and sustainable pensions; drawing up indicators to measure progress on promoting social inclusion, on social protection and on identifying good practices. This process will be firmly <Col N="106" /> rooted in the EU treaty if the Treaty of Nice is adopted. Ireland has been instrumental in getting support for the various provisions that have made this process possible. Exchanges on policy on combating social exclusion were provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam on the basis of a proposal by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Similarly, provision in the Treaty of Nice for exchanges on modernising social protection and for a social protection committee to co-ordinate the co-operation process generally in the social protection area is also the fruit of Irish proposals.</P>
    <P>This treaty-based co-operation process will ensure continued emphasis on social cohesion and significant improvements in social protection and in combating social exclusion. An objective of the relatively limited changes proposed by the Treaty of Nice must be that Ireland has nothing to fear and much to gain from equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have demonstrated during the past three decades that we are fully capable of adapting and taking advantage of the benefits and opportunities which full participation in the Union has offered us. Change holds no terror for us. Irish people are generous and outward-looking. They want the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to have the same opportunities that we had.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the comments of previous speakers on this side in regard to us as a nation. We have benefited not only financially, but socially, economically and culturally, from our membership of the European Union. Why should we say no to other countries becoming involved? That would be unfair and ungenerous of us. This country has always shown itself to be generous. One has only to look at the myriad of delegations and visits from the countries trying to gain access to the European Union to see exactly how a country such as Ireland has developed so progressively since joining the European Union. So far as the Government is concerned, I am pleased to see an element of unanimity on all sides of the House that this is a treaty that should be supported by the people. We recommend they accept this treaty for the betterment of all the peoples in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We could usefully start off this debate by reaffirming what the Treaty of Nice <Col N="107" /> actually does. In so doing we necessarily define also what it does not do. It deals with the Amsterdam leftovers but it is primarily the provision of a decision-making process. It is the building blocks for enlargement of the European Union. It is not enlargement as such, it does not bring about enlargement, it does not guarantee enlargement, but it gives us some of the wherewithal with which to start into that major project or to continue that major project. That is an essential part of understanding what this is all about because there will be difficulties attendant to enlargement. There will be national interests which appear to conflict. There will be problems as between existing member states and applicant member states. Those problems are not dealt with in Nice, nor should they be. What Nice gives us is the basis, the structure, the building blocks. It is the <i>sine qua non</i> and nothing more. As a result I suspect much of the language and the content of the Treaty of Nice is arcane or, to use a more usual word, boring. It presents a difficulty and a challenge to those of us in this House and elsewhere who will be seeking to encourage the people to support the content of the treaty.</P>
      <P>Our experience in the past 30 years is instructive and interesting. Thirty years ago, before joining the European Economic Community, as it then was, in terms not only of our geography and our thinking, we were an insular country. In the meantime a great deal has changed not only in terms of the prosperity of our people and other tangible things but our practices, culture and thinking. Many Irish students have studied abroad. Many tourists have visited other European Union countries and do so in increasing numbers. Thankfully they still come here and we do an increasing amount of business with mainland European countries. Many younger Irish people will eat and drink European food and drink. They will have looked at Manchester United and Bayern Munich last night and will have been as familiar with the names of those on the Bayern team as those on the Manchester United team and probably just as well able to pronounce them. This has been a gradual and important process of assimilation and feeling that we are part of the same group of countries, nations and peoples who share a great deal, not just in terms of history, but in terms of where we wish to be and what we feel ourselves to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also the nature of the difficulty with enlargement. For many, including those of my generation, Europe stopped at the Iron Curtain &ndash; the Oder-Neisse line. Eastern Europe seems far away and, by and large, we have not done business with it. Most of us have never been to or rarely visit eastern Europe and we have not had the kind of experiences with Bucharest, Sofia and Budapest that we have had with Barcelona, Brussels or Paris. It will be difficult and something of an effort to extend the feeling of being part of the one group which is essential to underpinning the enlargement of the European Union <Col N="108" /> at the level of ordinary people. While this has to be encouraged and achieved, it will, inevitably, take time.</P>
    <P>In November 1989 we saw on television the people of Berlin taking down the wall. They did so in real and tangible ways &ndash; brick by brick, they pushed it, shoved it, dragged it down and popped champagne on top of it. A few weeks later we saw the surging mass of people on the streets of Prague as they engaged in what became the Velvet Revolution. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding the overthrow of a totalitarian regime.</P>
    <P>What was different about some of the seminal events of the 20th century and recent history was that we saw them take place on television. In a sense we participated in them and understood the importance of what was happening. In a real way, divisions were, literally, bulldozed down. It is important that they stay down and that we underpin the desire of those peoples for democracy. It may not be trendy to say so these days, but communism was not all bad. Purely in terms of money in the pocket or access to services, some in eastern Europe, particularly pensioners, would be better off if they were still living under a totalitarian regime. Some communist regimes in eastern Europe made a half decent effort to provide a measure of access to health and education services on the basis of equality which many countries in western Europe have not achieved in 30, 40 or 50 years. There are people who are materially, if not in other ways, worse off because of events.</P>
    <P>I make this point because we should not assume that democracy is entrenched in eastern Europe or that it does not have to be anchored and underpinned. This has to happen because forces are at work and there is a level of dissatisfaction, such as in the former German Democratic Republic, which undermines democracy in a real, tangible and, potentially, dangerous way.</P>
    <P>Those of us in western Europe who have settled into our relatively prosperous ways have to do our bit. We owe it to the people of eastern Europe because we have been there. We lived under a colonial power. That was 100 years ago, but the folk memory is, perhaps, more recent. We were a poorer country in the more recent past &ndash; 20 or 30 years ago. As a result we should have some understanding of what the peoples of eastern Europe went through and because of our size and history, we have a role to play in ensuring the democracy they overwhelmingly opted for 12 and 13 years ago is anchored and made safe for the future.</P>
    <P>We need to achieve these objectives because the consequences of not doing so are, potentially, very dangerous. We are aware of the situation in the Balkans and the dangers posed by events in Macedonia. In addition, we saw what happened following the break-up of Yugoslavia. We should also be conscious of minorities in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic states which have <Col N="109" /> not always been treated well by the majorities in those countries.</P>
    <P>There are unresolved differences regarding boundaries and the rights of nations in eastern Europe. These differences will be resolved in the context of an enlarged Europe in a peaceful way by democratic exchanges or in different ways. We saw examples of the latter in the recent past. Such events are dangerous and ugly and we should do all we can to ensure these disputes do not go down that road.</P>
    <P>The tendency in Ireland can be to paint everything too negatively. We see the threats rather than the opportunities and regard workers from eastern Europe as taking our jobs and houses. In addition, we regard these countries as competitors because, by and large, their economies are agricultural. These countries are viewed as taking the Structural Funds which were once ours and which some in this country still regard as rightfully ours.</P>
    <P>This situation is not, nor should it be, a zero sum game. We in Ireland have grown up and the country has moved on. We must see these events as opportunities, not threats. The countries of eastern Europe are markets for our goods and business people. However, we need to bed down their practices. It is no secret that some Irish companies seeking to do business in eastern Europe have had less than pleasant experiences. The way of doing business in eastern Europe is not of the same standard as in Ireland. However, we do not need to look too far into our past to realise that we have also done a bit of growing up in this regard.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation from a selfish Irish point of view, workers in eastern Europe are as much a resource as a problem. The days when Ireland is eligible for Structural Funds will be over in four or five years. There is no point in lamenting this fact or blaming others for it. We should welcome the day when we are net contributors to the European Union rather than taking money from the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The current situation presents political opportunities for Ireland as we share a good deal with some of the applicant states. Many of these countries are similar in size to Ireland and look to us as a role model and a country which has done well through the European Union and which has contributed much to it. I visited Estonia 18 months ago and was taken by the fact that opinion formers and business people were anxious, as they probably are all over the applicant states, to learn from the Irish experience. This offers us an opportunity in terms of linkages and political influence which we have never had and which we should view as a positive development.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the details of the treaty one of which is that Ireland will lose three seats in the European Parliament. In the context of capping the numbers in Parliament, there is little to worry about as regards this measure. There is unlikely to be a revolution in Connacht-<Col N="110" /> Ulster, Munster, Leinster or Dublin because people's representation in the European Parliament is being reduced. This may disconcert some of the individuals concerned, but it will little disconcert the public. The bottom line in terms of the principle is that the weighting &ndash; our level of representation &ndash; remains the same and may even increase slightly. We should not be concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>A more substantive argument concerns the Commission. It is important to realise what has happened in this regard and what is in prospect. The five larger countries have agreed to forgo their second Commissioner from the commencement of the next Commission in 2005. It has been agreed that until there are 27 member states, each country will be guaranteed a Commissioner. We have not yet decided what will happen when there are 27 member states. However, we know that this will have to be decided unanimously.</P>
    <P>Countries such as Ireland should be clear that our interests lie in having a strong Commission. I do not believe that Ireland is best served by intergovernmentalism. The Commission has always been, and continues to be, the guarantor of the small member states, the rights of citizens and Europe as a whole. That is something from which we have benefited and from which we stand to benefit in the future.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions of the treaty that enhance the powers of the president. We saw the lamentable failure of the Santer Commission to come to grips with obvious difficulties in the bureaucracy of the European Commission and we must give the power to future presidents to allocate portfolios between the members of the Commission, to remove people and to shift people around as he or she might choose to do.</P>
    <P>QMV is a mess. We would all be better served if there was a much more straightforward, simple system of qualified majority voting. To borrow a phrase from a different context, to have this sort of triple lock that we have is, to say the least, very confusing. In particular, the provision dealing with the population requirement is something that we could have done without. I understand why it is there but I am sorry it is and I hope it will not be invoked very often. We would all be better off if a QMV system applied over a wide area which was much more straightforward. Qualified majority voting with the requirement of a majority of members would have done the job more than adequately.</P>
    <P>There are people in this House who oppose the treaty, as they have opposed all previous treaties, who make much of sovereignty and who link the notion of sovereignty with the veto. The veto is a very much overrated commodity. I remember well the comments of Prime Minister Blair on this issue when he returned from Nice, which I thought were interesting. He said that people who argue for the veto seem to automatically assume two things. They automatically assume that one cannot persuade anybody else to agree with one and that one will always be the oppressed min<Col N="111" /> ority rather than part of the frustrated majority that wants to get things through. The reality is that it very rarely happens that a country has to use the veto. I am not aware of a single case in which Ireland's national interests have been trampled on during the 30 years of membership. We remember the celebrated case of the milk levy when the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald travelled to the capitals of Europe and forcibly put the case. That is, in many cases, the more substantive bottom line. If there is a genuine political argument to be made that a country's national interests are at stake, by and large, that argument will hold good and will hold sway.</P>
    <P>The guarantor or the guarantee of the treaties is fine but one cannot, politically, use it all that often. The truth is that the combination of countries that people conjure up to try to make an argument against the treaty provisions is unlikely to happen. We are looking at technical possibilities which, in the real world of politics and the European Council, do not tend to occur.</P>
    <P>The issue of the human rights declaration is an interesting one. I read it just last week and it has much to contribute. It deals very much with the rights of Europeans as European citizens and of countries as part of the European Union. It is good that it should do that but we could overstate this. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the incorporation into Irish law of the European Convention on Human Rights which has a tested jurisprudence. We know from where it is coming and we have been party to that convention for many years. We know what to expect and that is probably the better template for protecting human rights in Ireland into the future. There is no contradiction between protecting our rights as human beings and protecting the rights of citizens as citizens, but at least we know from where the convention is coming. It is early days yet in terms of its incorporation into the Constitution and it will be interesting, to say the least, where that goes.</P>
    <P>I would like to address some of the arguments against the treaty and the primary one is one of sovereignty. There is nothing in the Nice treaty which, in any way, seriously affects sovereignty. What I find particularly galling is the argument that is frequently made that somehow isolationism is a left wing or progressive thing or that being opposed to the various treaties which have underpinned the European Union is a left wing or progress thing. It is nothing of the sort. The suggestion is that we in little Ireland are the angels and that we would have brought in environmental and social protection legislation were we left to ourselves. We would have done nothing of the sort.</P>
    <P>Even these days we are still lagging very much behind in terms of our implementation of European directives &ndash; for example, in regard to heritage or the environment. We could not do some of these things ourselves. We could not take on the international polluters and the multinationals <Col N="112" /> except on the basis of equality which comes from pooling our sovereignty and decision-making processes with other countries. If we on the left have learned anything in the past 30 years, it is the need to pool sovereignty and effort to deal with those forces coming from a different set of priorities. Perhaps one would get no better example than the issue of global warming. Is it being seriously suggested by some of those who oppose this treaty that we in little Ireland could possibly do anything about this by ourselves if we wanted to? It clearly would not be possible. It is clearly one of those issues where pooling of sovereignty and effort is not only desirable, but absolutely indispensable.</P>
    <P>Looking at television and the experience in Berlin in November 1989 when those bricks were pulled down, we in Ireland have a unique role in this whole process of enlargement. Each and every one of our citizens over the age of 18 is given a unique power because uniquely the people will be consulted directly on the issue of enlargement. We alone can do a great deal of damage in putting back up those divisions and in putting back up, in a very symbolic way, the bricks in the Berlin Wall. We should not do that because to do so would be wrong and dangerous and it would not be in our national interest. We can do our little bit in creating what Mikhail Gorbachev once called our common European home.</P>

      <P>Ireland's participation in the EU has been invaluable to the Garda Síochána in its fight against crime. Drug traffickers and other organised criminals do not recognise national boundaries. Co-operation between the relevant national authorities is vital in counteracting the threat posed by transnational organised crime, and our membership of the EU has facilitated this co-operation. It has also enabled Ireland to participate in the development of EU strategies to combat the twin problems of drugs and organised crime.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides that the Union's objective will be to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common actions among the member states in the fields of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia. A series of joint actions, Council decisions and action plans have been adopted to achieve this objective. For example, in June 2000 the European Council endorsed the EU action plan on drugs. The plan sets out a series of detailed measures in relation to tackling the supply and demand for drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A notable achievement of the EU in combating organised crime has been the adoption of the Europol convention which entered into force on 1 October 1998. Europol supports member states by facilitating the exchange of information and intelligence and by providing analyses, expertise, <Col N="113" /> training, co-ordination and technical support. The Garda has liaison officers based at Interpol headquarters in Lyons and Europol headquarters in The Hague and in London, Paris and Madrid. These officers provide assistance to home-based units involved in investigations with an EU or other international dimension.</P>
    <P>Officers from the relevant home-based units are in contact with their colleagues from other EU member states on a regular basis regarding investigations on drug trafficking and other forms of criminal activity. This contact involves information and intelligence sharing, with joint operations which may involve a number of jurisdictions in a single operation. The Criminal Assets Bureau has successfully conducted investigations resulting in the confiscation of illegally obtained assets and wealth, held both inside and outside this jurisdiction. It maintains close contact with its EU partners in the identification, tracing and seizing of illegally obtained assets or wealth. It is noteworthy that the UK is to establish a unit with similar functions to the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>Practical co-operation between the law enforcement agencies has been greatly facilitated by the adoption and implementation of programmes funded by the EU. These programmes take on various forms and provide an opportunity for an exchange of experience, best practice and the establishment of contact points within the EU law enforcement agencies. Specific programmes include OISIN, developed during the last Irish Presidency of the EU, which has encouraged and promoted co-operation between law enforcement agencies and FALCONE, which has a focus on organised crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda has hosted a number of projects under these EU programmes which have proven to be extremely beneficial to it and to law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions. One such OISIN project, hosted by the Garda in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies in five other member states, had as its objectives the identification of drug trafficking trends and best practice in combating drug trafficking within the EU. This project has been successful and of considerable benefit to all involved. For example, as a result of contacts made during this project a number of Irish criminals residing or operating outside the State were identified and targeted resulting in major seizures of drugs and firearms intended to be brought into this country.</P>
    <P>EU programmes not only deal with police co-operation in the fight against organised crime but also provide assistance in enhancing police expertise in other ways. For example, the Garda recently received an award for an EU-backed project aimed at eliminating racial discrimination. The award, worth 30,000, will go towards producing guidebooks for the Garda and ethnic communities aimed at improving relations between the two.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the EU has been extremely beneficial in enabling Ireland to tackle the inter<Col N="114" /> national aspects of drug trafficking and other forms of organised criminal activity. The level of co-operation between Ireland and its EU partners in this area is likely to increase over the next few years. In this regard the special meeting of the European Council in Tampere laid down common objectives and strategies for dealing with international crime.</P>
    <P>All member states recognise the importance of mutual assistance in criminal matters and are parties to the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Parties to the convention are committed to helping each other in relation to criminal proceedings, such as obtaining evidence in one country for use in another, or serving summonses issued in one country in another. The convention dates from 1959, however, and was generally perceived to be in need of updating. Member states, therefore, completed negotiations and signed last May a Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters between member states of the European Union, the aim of which is to supplement the 1959 convention as it applies to them.</P>
    <P>The convention seeks to supplement the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, 1959, and build on the co-operation that already exists among member states. The main provisions of the convention set out the circumstances in which mutual assistance may be requested and detail the procedures governing the sending and service of documents in such requests. It enables evidence to be taken in accordance with the law of the requesting state rather than the requested state.</P>
    <P>To facilitate requests for assistance the convention also makes provision for the spontaneous exchange of information; the return to the rightful owner of property seized in the course of investigations; the temporary transfer abroad of persons held in custody for the purpose of giving evidence; new ways of hearing witnesses and experts by video link and telephone conference; controlled deliveries of suspect consignments to be allowed on the territory of another member state; the setting up of joint investigation teams, where agreed between member states; assistance being given by way of covert investigations &ndash; Ireland proposes to make a declaration at the time of signature of the convention that it will not be bound by the provisions of that article; and interception of telecommunications. This convention is a good example of how member states have come together and agreed to co-operate to combat crime. The convention will contribute to further streamlining of assistance between national authorities in their pursuit of organised crime across Europe.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice provides for an expected significant enlargement of the EU. I will avail of every opportunity I can to raise with my colleagues in the candidate countries how my Department can be of assistance to them in the successful conclusion of their application for EU <Col N="115" /> membership. I will also meet the Hungarian Minister for Justice in Dublin next month for similar discussions.</P>
    <P>I have only touched on a few areas where EU membership has benefited Ireland in the justice and home affairs areas. EU membership has also been of benefit in the equality area for which I am responsible. Equal pay legislation and legislation outlawing discrimination in employment on grounds of gender and marital status was introduced on foot of provisions in the treaties. Employment equality and equal pay legislation enshrine the rights to equality in remuneration and opportunity between men and women and is undoubtedly responsible in part for the more equality conscious environment in which we live and work. The Treaty of Nice ensures that Union incentive measures will be taken which support anti-discrimination measures taken by member states.</P>
    <P>The Government, with the assistance of EU funding, has significantly increased investment in child care funding initiatives in recent years to support existing child care places, increase the number of child care places and facilities and improve the quality of child care services. More than 40 million has been allocated under the equal opportunities child care programme for capital and staffing purposes since July 2000.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of significant developments in the immigration and asylum areas. Under the EU EURODAC regulation, the fingerprints of asylum seekers and of certain illegal immigrants who may have claimed asylum in the EU or may do so in the future will be taken and compared through a central database. This will help to establish which member state has responsibility under the Dublin Convention and will deter multiple claims and abusive asylum claims more generally.</P>
    <P>The regulation facilitates the detection of multiple applicants and it is essential for the effective application of the Dublin Convention. It will act as an effective deterrent to those who would wish to make multiple asylum claims in this State alone or here and in other member states. Fingerprinting of asylum seekers is not unique to Ireland and has been an integral part of asylum law for many years in European countries, the US, Canada and elsewhere. The intention is not to criminalise or stigmatise but rather to deter and prevent abuse of our asylum procedures.</P>
    <P>A framework for the creation of a common European asylum system is contained in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council and in Title IV of the EU Treaty. At Tampere, in particular, the Council agreed to work towards the creation of a common asylum system in the EU on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention. To date we have had proposals in the asylum area on the EURODAC fingerprinting regulation, a decision on a European refugee fund, a directive on temporary protection and, most recently, a proposal for a Coun<Col N="116" /> cil directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status. Proposals are also expected in the coming months on the revision of the Dublin Convention and rules on the recognition and content of refugee status.</P>
    <P>EU membership has been of enormous benefit to the economy. While our education system and social partnership have combined to help the economy rise to unexpected heights, it would be remiss of anybody to ignore the fact that membership of the EU has been a vital cog in Ireland's success.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that without the transfer of substantial funds, either by way of Structural or Cohesion Funds or under the CAP, Ireland could not have hoped to attain the economic success which has been attained in recent years. It is all too easy to forget these matters. However, it is incumbent upon us to recall that when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in the 1970s it was a far poorer country. Previous decades had seen mass emigration and the country had suffered from chronic unemployment for many of those decades. We also had our difficulties subsequent to joining the European Union but slowly and surely membership, along with the factors I mentioned, ensured that Ireland would take its place among the best economies in Europe. It was no accident or coincidence. It happened because our education system, social partnership and membership of the European Union combined to lift the State from its previous position.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how there could be opposition from a political party in the State to enlargement under the Nice Treaty. Nonetheless, the Green Party in this country has decided to oppose the treaty. It matters little to the Green Party in this jurisdiction that the far larger Green Party in Germany has no difficulty with the treaty. The arguments which the Irish Green Party have put forward have been cogently answered but the party is intent on holding on to its wacky image as it teeters on the brink of normal political life in this country. Often the assumptions and arguments put forward by this party have not been adequately challenged either in the House or outside. It is time the Irish people were told the truth about this party, however small it may be. It has some of the wackiest proposals of any political party in the European Union and it is fair to conclude that if the party ever became a majority Government party here, we would have the wackiest republic not just in Europe but in the world. I have no doubt of that.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the European Convention on Human Rights. We are set to incorporate the convention into Irish law in the near future. The European Convention <Col N="117" /> on Human Rights was signed by Ireland almost 50 years ago but was never incorporated into Irish law. While it has been law for Ireland, it is not law in Ireland. Until incorporation, people will be obliged, as they have been, to bring their cases under the convention to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, having exhausted all constitutional possibilities in Ireland first. Incorporation will mean that for the first time in the history of the State, people will be in a position to go to the courts in this country to vindicate their rights under the convention.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this will result in a radical change in how this country conducts its business. However, it is a Pandora's box so it is impossible to say at this point precisely what will emerge. The 1937 Constitution has been extremely useful in terms of the enforcement and protection of human rights in this jurisdiction. Nineteen rights are outlined in the Constitution and these have been most useful. The Irish Supreme Court, over the decades since the promulgation of the Constitution, has sought to interpret the human rights provisions in an expansive way. The argument could be made that human rights in this country have been given a greater degree of expression by the courts than is the case in convention countries, that is, countries in which the convention has already been incorporated. This is a great tribute to the Supreme Court. That court has had a succession of eminent judges who ensured that Irish human rights were among the most expansive in the world.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the European Convention on Human Rights has proven to be an extremely useful tool across Europe in the protection and enforcement of human rights. The incorporation of the convention in this jurisdiction will be welcomed by all right thinking people. It was stated in the Good Friday Agreement that we would examine our human rights legislation to see if it could be improved and, in this respect, the Government decided to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights. The convention has already been incorporated in Great Britain. A human rights commission will be established here on a statutory basis under the legislation which will incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights. It will have a broad remit and, no doubt, will help to buttress the rights already in existence and which have been given expression both in the Constitution and by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, Europe has been good for Ireland. It has been good in so many ways that it would be an act of gross negligence and deep injustice were Ireland now to vote against enlargement. That injustice would be perpetrated not just upon the countries which are applying to join the European Union but it would also represent an injustice to ourselves. Enlargement of the European Union is not a threat for Ireland. It is an opportunity for Ireland to display its talents to the world and the creation of a greater market within which Ireland can export without restriction. <Col N="118" /> Ireland can make a major and significant contribution to an enlarged Europe.</P>

      <P>There will be plenty of time to exchange views on the meaning of the word in its context.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I have campaigned actively in my constituency on every referendum on Europe. I will do so in this campaign too. Ireland has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union. It has also made a good contribution to the Union, something that often tends to go unnoticed. We might have entered as a poor country in comparison with our more powerful colleagues. Greater credence is now put on the Structural Funds they created for our benefit than the real reason for our success in Europe, which was access to bigger markets. Without doubt, access to the Single Market gave Ireland and other countries like it the opportunity to trade without obstacle and freely. The past ten years have proven that.</P>
      <P>Before that the bigger countries had a huge advantage and, fair play to them, they used it very effectively. They had a lot of experience as colonisers, which they used to their advantage &ndash; they still do so when they get the odd opportunity. We accepted the <i>status quo</i> for far too long but we came into our own when we got the opportunity to trade as an equal entity within the EU. We were and will continue to be very successful.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opposing views that have been expressed, which are important to any debate because one can dispel them when one hears them. Scare stories emerged during the Amsterdam treaty but we should face reality and deal with those views. I am chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and we are engaged in public hearings on this issue, which is another opportunity to encourage the debate and dialogue necessary. We can then come to a conclusion we can stand over with authority rather than skulking away from the issue. All committee members have adopted that policy and I compliment them on that, on the work they have done to promote Irish issues at every possible European forum and on their work in assisting the applicant countries gain greater access to information and to our first-hand experience of membership of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Every Member should contribute to this debate. Not everything the EU does is right &ndash; that is something to be stitched into the record. For the past few years protection of the food chain has concerned me. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will agree with me that the EU had a central role in that area and it failed. We had an excellent record in this area until recently and now it is suggested that freedom of movement was the cause of our current problems when of course it was not. Regulations can be put in place at any time to restrict that freedom of movement if it affects vital national interests, animal health, human health or the food chain in particular. What happened as soon as there was an outbreak of disease in Britain? The French Government instantly banned all imports. Does it not automatically follow that if there were a risk in any of the procedures between the member states prior to that, action should have been taken? That action was not taken. Consumers have rights in this area as well and consumer protection is paramount in what we are doing at present.</P>
    <P>The European institutions &ndash; the Commission, the Parliament and so on &ndash; must look at themselves and ask if they moved with one accord. The answer is no, and that issue must be tackled, regardless of whether we in the EU like it. The applicant countries will also be anxious to see that done. They have concerns and they want to be able to show their people, to whom they are giving the message of expansion and integration, that they have seen at first hand that the EU is capable of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Look at how the French truckers' strike affected the EU. It affected one country first but there was no meeting of minds on the matter and unilateral action was taken which had a domino effect in Belgium, Holland, Britain and ultimately here. It is surely not too much to ask of the combined wisdom of the EU that it tackle that issue. Transport is vital to the EU if we are to bring people together. It should be possible for the great minds in Europe to think as one on such an issue but they have not done so.</P>
    <P>They will need to, however, because if that issue is not addressed we will have problems in the future. I am loath to quote Abraham Lincoln, as I have often done in the past, but he said that a house divided within itself cannot stand and he was right. Huge efforts were made in the United States to ensure their house would stand and not be divided, and tragic decisions were made, but they succeeded in keeping the house together. The challenge to Europe now and for the future is the extent to which Europe is prepared to keep its house together. The challenges are great and we stand at the crossroads of the evolution of the European project. If all member states and applicant nations are successful, then Europe has a bright and prosperous future.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to remember Europe's tragic history. Hardly a decade in the <Col N="120" /> past 500 years passed without a major war. The diversity of cultures and nationalities throughout Europe, together with the bitterness that exists to this day across a variety of borders, is an issue that will emerge again and again. From dealing with both applicant nations and our colleagues within the EU, I feel far too great an emphasis is placed on the EU's ability to resolve these issues. If the participating parties, or enemies, do not themselves come to grips with the situation, the possibility of a resolution and ultimate peace and prosperity within the EU is also threatened. Not only are the countries directly involved threatened, the entire surface of the EU is also threatened. We must also learn that from our history.</P>
    <P>We all support the concept of European enlargement and integration. The Amsterdam treaty has already been passed but we must also support the Nice treaty. However, we should not be so protective about our positions simply because someone points the finger at us. We should also be able to pick holes in it to cast more light on the issue. If we do not do so we leave ourselves open and we would be weaker in the future if pressure is put on the EU from a variety of sources.</P>
    <P>I am amused by the suggestion that the greater the degree of integration and immersion within Europe, the greater the threat to our culture, a point that has already been made. The reverse is the case. It has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt that we did not have economic independence all those years ago and that as soon as we got that economic independence our culture flourished. We became international personalities all of a sudden and Irish people were welcome all over the world. It was far from the begging bowl attitude for which we were known in Europe and elsewhere. We were suddenly respected, authoritative, forthright, outgoing and progressive. The lesson to be learnt is that without doubt our future is within the Union. The degree to which we participate will determine the extent to which we will benefit from it in the future.</P>
    <P>In the present economic climate we have a moral duty to explain to applicant countries the benefits of membership of the Union and the degree to which they, like us, can contribute to its stability. Some of the more powerful member states contend that while smaller countries are welcome in the Union they benefit greatly from membership. The smaller countries make a very important contribution to the Union in terms of stability, which is a critical element of the European project. Instability was created by the past actions of the more powerful member states. The emergence of the smaller countries who have an interest in the future of the Union is reflected in the extent to which stability has prevailed.</P>
    <P>When the founding fathers &ndash; Adenauer, Monnet and Schumann &ndash; forged the concept of European unity they acted in the legacy of two world wars in quick succession. In the Second World War approximately 60 million people were sacrificed to enable the European peoples prove to <Col N="121" /> themselves that they could not win against each other and that something else would have to prevail. The founding fathers decided to draft the future of Europe from the ashes and they did a very good job. Other Members have commented on the extent to which they achieved their purpose.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain we are in a new era. There is a new challenge and an opportunity for all Europeans to reflect on 50 years of the emerging European Union and contrast that with what went before. The comparison leaves the Union as a concept well ahead of anything previously. As Irish people and committed Europeans it is in our interests to further commit ourselves to the concept of European enlargement and integration, including the deepening and widening of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Irish Business Bureau is the EU representative office of IBEC. An article in its publication, the <i>European Monthly Newsletter </i>of December 2000 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Nice negotiations were a success for the applicant countries and exhausting for the participants. Any remaining ambiguity about the EU's commitment to a wide and deep enlargement has been removed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that the applicant countries will join once they prove they have the capacity to adopt the necessary criteria and in this context some may join as soon as 2005. I agree with that, although the start date envisaged has a habit of moving and it does not always relate to the degree of readiness of the applicant countries. We will have been aware of this from our own application for membership.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main casualty of the summit was the French presidency. Its diplomatic relations with many member states was strained to the limit. The implications for the future working methods of the European Council, caused by President Chirac's aggressive style of chairmanship, will need to be considered. The fraught relations between some other partners will also have to be mended. Many leaders, including the Taoiseach, remarked that a repeat of the Nice experience should be avoided in future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This indicates the long knives that must have been repeatedly wielded. Some of us, including the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will have had experience of this from our engagements with our friends in Europe over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The article goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission left Nice battered and bruised. The credibility of the institutions suf<Col N="122" /> fered as it was sidelined at crucial stages of the negotiations. The semi-public critique by the Commission's secretary-general of the French presidency's handling of the summit no doubt struck a chord with some, but not a high note. With staff morale at an all time low the Commission is facing difficulties over the next few years.</P>
    <P>We need a strong Commission. It must be purposeful and aspire at all times to the European ideals. The danger is that it could be weakened arising from developments over the last couple of years, especially arising from the Parliament's influence and its intention to exert it to a greater extent. That is generally accepted but it is not necessarily a useful development for the smaller countries.</P>
    <P>We must balance all the issues. I will not deal with the weighting of the votes, which has been addressed by others. With the growth of the Union there may be a tendency by some member states to request a greater degree of flexibility on the extent to which each member state would commit itself to the concept. That may be good initially but in the long-term it would be a bad development. It would be a great weakness if any treaty or agreement is entered into or formal negotiations concluded on the basis that one, all or any can opt in or out at their convenience. We must be very careful to ensure that this is not allowed because the weakness of the Union could undermine its credibility in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole purpose of this Bill is to allow Ireland hold a constitutional referendum for the purpose of ratifying the Treaty of Nice. Ireland is the only member state to hold a referendum on the treaty. It is good to hold referendums on issues of this kind. It is nothing of which we should be afraid.</P>
      <P>A number of previous treaties have been approved by referendum with varying majorities. The legal advice to the Government is that it is necessary to hold a referendum on this treaty. The Government could have ratified the treaty following a debate in the Dáil but that would have left the treaty open to legal dispute. Given the independence of the Judiciary nobody could say how the courts would rule on any action taken. The Government is taking a prudent approach in consulting the people in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I was not a Member of the House when some of the previous debates on treaty ratifications were held but there was always an understanding that future treaties would be put to the people by way of referendum. There was a general understanding that that would be the case but it was not a precise commitment. I am pleased that the Government is following the general pattern of previous referenda and providing for a referendum on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treaty completes the process of institutional reform to allow for enlargement. At present there are 15 member states and at the end <Col N="123" /> of this long process there may be as many as 27 member states. When I was a young fellow in school, which some people might say was not that long ago, I remember trying to learn the 32 counties of Ireland and the number of counties in each province. I would safely say that if one stood anywhere outside this House &ndash; I might even say inside this House &ndash; and asked people to list all 15 member states, most people would know ten, 11 or 12 but many people would struggle to list them all. We will find it far more difficulty to list 27 member states in due course. For the record, I want to state the 12 countries conducting accession negotiations with the European Union. They are: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. The list will appear strange to the majority of Irish people. The vast majority of Irish people have had no dealings whatever with these countries in the past and it will be a new experience. In truth, the only reason many Irish people would have heard of those countries would have been as a result of Ireland playing international soccer matches against them. Therefore, in a curious way sport has to date made the world a smaller place and now we will do it formally through the political process.</P>
    <P>When we complete this process of enlargement the population of the European Union will increase from the current level of about 370 million to 550 million. When we campaign for the referendum, people will ask us what will ratifying the Nice treaty mean for Ireland in the short-term. It will mean very little in the short-term. This treaty is not as significant in its own right as the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty or the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>We will see the first impact of this treaty when the next Commission is appointed in a couple of years and for the first time the five large countries will give up their second Commissioners. To date the five large countries have had two Commissioners each and on that occasion they will agree to have one Commissioner only. Therefore, in the short-term one can argue that there will be a benefit for the smaller countries in that the larger countries will be ceding some of their influence and power on the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Eventually after perhaps ten years, when all the new 12 member states have joined and the membership of the European Community has increased to 27, the Commission will decide by a unanimous vote on the size of the Commission for the future. The important element of that is that that Commission will contain fewer than 27 members, which means that there will be fewer Commissioners than member states. For the first time, ten years from now or whenever this will occur, every member state will not have a Commissioner in every Commission. The practice to be adopted will involve rotating Commissioners and I am pleased that this treaty states that this will be done on an equal basis, irrespective of size <Col N="124" /> of population. Therefore, on some occasions we will find that some of the bigger member states will be without a Commissioner during a particular period and on other occasions a smaller member state will be affected. No doubt on rare occasions every few years Ireland might find itself without a Commissioner for a period but we will have close working relationships with small groups of nations of a similar size which will represent the interests of Ireland on the Commission at that stage.</P>
    <P>On the Commission itself, votes are decided by a majority. That is a straightforward process which we all understand. When it comes to the Council of Ministers, however, the voting is far more complicated and much of the negotiation at Nice dealt specifically with these issues. There will now be a greater level of voting by qualified majority on many, but not all, issues.</P>
    <P>There are three essential components to the process of voting by qualified majority. To date, Ireland has had three of the 87 votes in the qualified majority voting system. Eventually at the end of this process, we will have seven of the 345 votes. In those situations, any member state can ask to ensure that any decision by qualified majority voting will have the support of at least 62% of the population of the expanded European Union. That is quite a high percentage, well above a simple majority. In addition, there must be a majority of member states in favour of a particular decision made under those procedures. Therefore, there are three fallback positions. There will not be simple voting majorities at Commission level on many of these issues and that is an important point.</P>
    <P>People have said that Ireland will have much less influence than it had in the past. Ireland will have about 0.8% of the total population of the 550 million in the European Union but it will have 2.2% of the weighted votes. We will have two and a half times more votes under the weighted voting system than our population would justify strictly on a numerical basis. From that point of view, we cannot complain. It is not a bad arrangement. It is as good an arrangement as the country could expect in this situation.</P>
    <P>The question of military neutrality is an issue which has arisen in all these debates in the past. It is not something which will feature on this occasion to the same extent, but I am quite sure it will raise its head. I am aware of a meeting held in Portlaoise during the week on the Nice treaty and I suspect it is a bandwagon for some group or organisation to stir up the debate and state that we will all be conscripted into a European army before the end of the decade. I expect to hear such comments as the debate develops but we will have no difficulty dealing with those comments and bringing a bit of reality to the debate.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Amsterdam Treaty specified a clear role for the Western European Union, which was to act almost as an agent for the European Union, but under the Nice treaty that role has been diminished. That is a good <Col N="125" /> development. Those people who were fearful of the role of the Western European Union in the past and its connections with NATO did a great deal of scaremongering but we are now seeing the role of the Western European Union being diminished considerably. One of the reasons for this is the European Union's capacity in its own right to deal with and carry out humanitarian and crisis management and conflict prevention tasks have increased. That has involved a long and difficult negotiation process but there have been significant improvements in that area under what are generally called the Petersberg Tasks. Such phraseology is well understood in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Iveagh House and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs but it is not understood by 99.99% of the public. In our debate we should shy away from using phrases like that which the people of Ireland do not understand. We should conduct debates like this in simple English and not get carried away in the jargon to which people, who deal with these issues on a daily basis, are accustomed.</P>
    <P>For Ireland to participate in any of these crisis management or conflict prevention tasks it will be necessary for the Government to give the go ahead. It is not a European decision and it would not be covered by the qualified voting majority process. The Government of Ireland would have to give the go ahead and our policy to date, which will continue, is that we will only participate in such activities where it is a United Nations operation. That is something which the people of Ireland will readily accept when we explain it to them if it arises during the course of the referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>We are also looking at changes in the membership of the European Parliament. Currently there are 626 MEPs and in the last referendum we made provision to extend its membership to approximately 700. Under this treaty, we will extend its membership to 732. When there will be 27 member states and 732 MEPs, Ireland will have 12 MEPs rather than 15, as is currently the case. Some people might say that will result in a diminution of our representation but I would always argue that it is quality not quantity that will count. Given that Ireland in an enlarged Europe will have only 12 MEPs, their role and status and the power, influence and respect with which they will be held will increase over time because people will find that the European Parliament will become more important and more powerful. Those 12 MEPs who will represent Ireland may have far more influence on matters affecting us here than Cabinet members at home. We will have to monitor that situation as it evolves. A reduction in the level of representation was the only area on which we had to make a concession in the negotiations in Nice. I do not think that will pose a major problem for Ireland. If we have good quality people working in Europe in conjunction with our Commissioner, the Government and parties in the European Par<Col N="126" /> liament, we will be well represented at European level.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the reduction in the number of MEPs may not necessarily happen in the next European elections in 2004. It will happen over a period as the membership of the Union increases from 15 to 27. It could be at least ten years before that process is fully completed and the number of our MEPs will be reduced to 12. I do not envisage that happening at the next European elections. It may happen in stages, with the number of MEPs reduced by one in the next European elections, by a further one in the following elections and by a further one in the subsequent elections.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to praise the Taoiseach for his input into the negotiations. He was ably assisted by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. Many speakers said that they were difficult negotiations as those participating in them had different perspectives. It was essential that those representing us were aware of the critical points that had to be dealt with. They ensured that taxation matters were not incorporated into the treaty and that national Government would have sovereignty on them, which is as it should be. I remember the debate on the last referendum when the buzzword was &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, which means passing the decision-making process down as near as possible to the people on the ground. To take taxation matters out of the hands of national Government would be the opposite to subsidiarity, it would be an element of centralisation at European level. That would be the opposite to what the people were informed would be the case in signing up to these treaties. When anyone raises that issue again, we should ask them how it would reflect subsidiarity. We were successful in arguing that we and each other member state is in the best position to determine its own taxation levels rather than they being decided by the European Commission or European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only country that will hold a referendum on this treaty. I am pleased it will be held early in the year, as member states have a long period during which to ratify the treaty. It is only a few months since it was signed. While it is fresh in everyone's mind, now is the time to put it to the people.</P>
    <P>During the various debates on the last referendum, there was much talk about the democratic deficit. That is being added to across Europe by member states deciding not to hold referenda. We should not be afraid of holding one. I have no doubt it will not be an easy one to win and it will not be overwhelmingly carried to the extent that an earlier one was carried on whether we should join the EEC in the early 1970s, but such is life. We must accept that the complexities of modern political life are more difficult and not as black and white as they used to be many years ago.</P>
    <P>As to when the referendum will be held, that will depend largely on the foot and mouth disease <Col N="127" /> crisis. I have every confidence the Government will set the most appropriate date in light of that situation. I hope it will be held this side of the summer, as that would be in everybody's best interest given that the debate is ongoing here.</P>
    <P>Months and months of endless debate is not required on this proposal, as there is not as much in this treaty as there was in earlier treaties on which referenda were put to the people for ratification. This treaty is straightforward enough for people to digest. That is one the reasons three other referenda will be held on the same day, one on abolishing the death penalty and one on reform of the Judiciary. Those are straightforward issues. People will have a clear view on whether they are for or against the abolition of the death penalty. That does not require endless debate. When the think about it for a few minutes, most people will know their own minds. I do not think we will get caught up in endless debates on those issues as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The referendum on this treaty will be a real test of the maturity of our people, more so than earlier referenda. It was easy for us to say yes to Europe in earlier referenda when our position was strong on the beneficiary side. We benefited substantially financially in the past through the various funds and we were due to do so in the future. This is the first time we will be asking the people to vote yes for Europe when we are not being offered substantial funding for the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>It boils down to us simply asking the people to give the 12 countries seeking accession the same chance that we were given 25 or 30 years ago. We were given a chance as a small country to join what started off as a group of six countries, which expanded to nine, then 12 and now it stands at 15. We got the chance to join, gain the benefit of a large Single Market and draw down funds, and we used that opportunity well. The Irish example will be one of the examples that will be used by the 12 applicant nations of how European Structural Funds and other funds can help a country grow and prosper, but it is essential such funds are put to good use, as they were here. It would be selfish if Ireland said, &ldquo;No, we will not give those countries the same chance we were given on an earlier occasion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A minority would have a different attitude to this treaty. Such an attitude is reflected by the example of a couple who get permission to build a house in a rural village and a few years later when they have settled in and other couples from outside the area wish to build houses they are the first to object, complaining that such houses would spoil the view and that outsiders should not be seeking to build houses in the village. We must resist that attitude. We must welcome people in applicant countries into the European Union as we were welcomed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Referendum Commission to issue information for and against the treaty. It is not the Government's Constitution, it is the people's <Col N="128" /> Constitution and the people have a right to hear both sides of the argument. People panicked during the run-up to the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement and argued that taxpayers' money was being spent informing people about a no vote. Be that as it may, the result at the end of the day was better for that information being made available. We should go through the same process on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Referendum Commission ask journalists or people who are good at writing in simple English to write the script for the advertisements and not to ask people from a legal or technical background to do so. The advertisements on the last occasion were written in a style similar to the small print on the back of a hire purchase agreement. They were unintelligible to most people. People with legal or technical expertise could oversee the scripts, but they should not be involved in writing them. It is important good information on arguments for and against ratifying the treaty are made available to the public.</P>
    <P>An expanded Union with a population of 550 million people will be a bigger and stronger player. We will have more responsibility even though we are a small nation, as we will be part of a much bigger and stronger organisation on the world stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and the Nice treaty to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>In an enlarged Union a bigger Single Market would be very much in the interests of Irish businesses, such as our trading with Poland. It is in our interests, politically and economically, for the continent of Europe to be prosperous, stable and democratic. The possibility of business growth here following the accession of applicant countries can only be good for this country. It is welcome that the Treaty of Nice will not change the State's policy on neutrality and Irish peacekeeping troops will continue to serve only in operations authorised by the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>The Government must clarify its intentions on the holding of a referendum and publish the wording required to amend the Constitution. It must produce clear and concise information to enable people to understand what the treaty is about and the implications of the changes it proposes to the voting strengths of each member state and our place within the Commission. That is important. Advocates of the Nice Treaty will face a certain resistance from some people and it is important that people know what they are voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Popular support for the European economic and political process has fallen from 82% in the 1971 referendum on accession to 69.5% in the <Col N="129" /> referendum on the Single European Act in 1987, 68.7% in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and 60.4% in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty in 1998. Turnout has also fallen. While 70.9% came out to vote in 1971, just 44.1% &ndash; a dramatic drop &ndash; voted on the Single European Act in 1987 despite the fact that the referendum coincided with the European Parliament elections. The holding of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on the same day as a series of referendums on abortion enthused just 57.3% to vote. Even holding the referendum on the Belfast Agreement on the same day as the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty in 1998 only brought out 56.2% to vote. Compared to these issues, the three questions to be decided on the same day as the Nice Treaty are unlikely to send the electorate into a frenzy of popular participation.</P>
    <P>The people will be asked to delete the reference to capital punishment from the Constitution, provide for the disciplining of judges and approve Ireland's acceptance of the remit of the International Criminal Court. There is a danger of a very low turnout, about which Government sources are right to be concerned. It is very important, therefore, to sell the referendum to the public, a matter on which past referendums failed and the reason there has been such a decline in voter turnout. It would be very unwise to take public participation for granted.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned neutrality which other articulate debaters and the Green Party are using among other scare tactics to change the benefits of this debate. They are frightening people off by mentioning peacekeeping, neutrality and other issues. People are getting the wrong end of the stick listening to these articulate debaters promoting these issues. It is very important that the Government make the electorate aware of what it will be voting for. I am concerned that it be informed that it will be voting for the enlargement of the European Union. The Government should clarify the matter. The benefit of an enlarged Union is a larger market.</P>
    <P>The treaty provides for the reform of the institutions and decision-making procedures of the European Union to equip an enlarged Union to function effectively while maintaining important balances. From a national perspective, Ireland has an obvious interest in the success of an enlarged and well functioning European Union, from which we have gained considerably. Every member state is represented in the institutions and has an opportunity to influence their decisions, shape the rules and gain from co-operation. Ireland has benefited enormously from its involvement and changed profoundly as a result. That is the reason it is necessary to re-examine EU policies and strategies and policy making procedures to determine if they are still appropriate. An update is important to ensure what was effective is still beneficial. Ireland has much to gain from and contribute to an enlarged Union which is likely to be the main focus of debate in the <Col N="130" /> forthcoming referendum on the treaty on which the message needs to be communicated more effectively to the public.</P>
    <P>The European Union is in negotiation with the following countries: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Turkey, etc. The purpose of the new treaty is to complete the programme of institutional reform designed to prepare the Union for significant expansion of its membership. It is important that Ireland's voice will not be diminished in any way due to the admission of so many new member states. It was eventually agreed that from 2005, the date of the appointment of the next Commission, the five large states would forgo their right to nominate a second member to the Commission. It is important that Ireland should retain its Commissioner. Mr. Byrne is doing an excellent job and it is important that he is in place at this time of crisis. Having a Commissioner at the Cabinet table has been beneficial to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Each member state will nominate one member of the Commission until the European Union has 27 member states at which point the Council will decide. What this means is that each member state, including newly admitted member states, will nominate one member of the Commission until the European Union reaches 27 member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice will also increase the powers of the President of the Commission. The President will now have the authority to decide on the internal organisation of the Commission in order to ensure it acts consistently and effectively on the basis of co-operation. He will have the authority to allocate tasks among Commission members and relocate portfolios among Commissioners during their term of office.</P>
    <P>Another change concerns the vote allocated to each member state under the system of weighting in the Council. The change will provide for compensation for those member states who will lose the right to nominate a second Commissioner. The new treaty provides that from January 2005 the votes of existing member states will be weighted as follows; Germany, France and Italy, 29; Spain, 27; the Netherlands, 13; Greece, Belgium and Portugal, 12; Sweden and Austria, ten; and Denmark, Finland and Ireland, seven. It was agreed that to adopt a decision in the Union of 15 that from 2005 it will be necessary to secure 169 votes, or 71.31%, of the 237 available. The current figure is 62, or 71.6%, of the 87 available.</P>
    <P>Ireland's voting strength is very important. We will have seven votes, or 2.03%, of the 345 available in a Union of 27 member states, maintaining parity with Finland and Denmark. Ireland's share of total EU population in a Union of 27 member states will be 0.8%. Qualified majority voting already applies in the case of a large number of Council decisions, usually in conjunction with the co-decision procedures which give the European Parliament a role as co-legislator. There are 626 Members of the European Parliament in respect of which the Treaty sets a limit of 700. With the <Col N="131" /> expected enlargement of the Union, it will, therefore, be necessary to agree at the Intergovernmental Conference a reallocation of seats to accommodate new member states without creating a chamber that is too large to operate effectively.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Flanagan on Tuesday, 4 April 2001:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the restrictions and regulations imposed as a result of the current foot and mouth disease emergency, calls on the Government to establish a special task force to work in conjunction with an appropriate economic sub-committee of Cabinet, the role and function of which shall be to carry out an immediate economic impact assessment of the devastating effects to the economy and business as a consequence of foot and mouth disease with particular reference to the agri-food sector, food processing, transport and haulage, tourism, sporting and all outdoor pursuits, entertainment, leisure, bookmaking, hotel/restaurant, catering industry and many employment sectors throughout the economy where already hundreds of lay-offs have occurred and where thousands of job losses are threatened resulting in hardship and trauma for thousands of families and further calls on the Government to complete such an assessment without delay with a view towards introducing an appropriate range of measures and reliefs in the form of an aid package to mitigate the loss and damage involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the news today of the relaxation of some of the restrictions announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which I hope will help in the recovery of the economic losses incurred as a result of the foot and mouth crisis. In just over one week most Irish workers will be enjoying their first long break since Christmas. Many people living in Dublin city who take an Easter break will, probably, decide not to travel within the country because of the message from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not to travel to rural areas. This message to those living in large urban areas is often interpreted to mean that they should not travel to Kerry or Galway. Many who travel to such areas for weekends or holidays do not go near farms and the message from the Department must be clarified immediately.</P>
      <P>The impact of foot and mouth disease and the associated restrictions has created a huge sense of nervousness in the tourism industry which I witnessed for the first time when I travelled around south Kerry last Saturday. The figures show that bookings are significantly down and in many cases telephones are only ringing to cancel bookings. Unless drastic action is taken to support the industry, the rest of the summer will be a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night's comment by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, that the foot and mouth controls were having &ldquo;some adverse impact&rdquo; is unbelievable. Obviously, his ear is not to the ground. The losses and cancellations are absolutely devastating. Initial figures from various sectors within the tourism industry suggest serious losses. By the end of March an independent analysis for the tourism industry, conducted by Dumor Marketing Ltd., suggested that £223 million had been lost. If the crisis continues, the reduction in the number of outside visitors could amount to losses of £470 million. Losses in tourism revenue mean job losses. While I fully accept that we have a challenge in ensuring foot and mouth disease does not spread further within the island, we also have a duty to protect our second biggest national <Col N="133" /> industry. The time has come for action and clarity and consistency are required.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should sit down and iron out the serious discrepancies in the information emanating about the foot and mouth restrictions. It is time we had a consistent message from all Departments about what can be done. As the restrictions continue to be relaxed, it is crucial that all relevant websites, advertisements and public information campaigns state the same thing as Ministers. There is no room for inconsistency.</P>
    <P>Last week in the United Kingdom Tony Blair went all out to let the public at home and abroad know that Britain was open for business in terms of tourism. The Taoiseach has not yet made such an impassioned statement about our openness and welcome for tourists. I ask him to make a statement in support of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Those representing the tourism industry have been very pragmatic to date in their representations to Government since the beginning of the foot and mouth crisis. They have shown huge understanding of the initial measures undertaken to prevent the spread of the disease. In recent days they have argued that they are not seeking compensation, but rather want to be supported in taking very practical steps to rebuild the industry. One of the most practical steps we can take is to target the British market, which is huge. I cannot understand the reason, since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, Bord Fáilte has practically abandoned advertising in the British market from which bookings have fallen by a frightening 60%.</P>
    <P>The US market has also been significantly damaged. Incorrect messages and distressing pictures from the United Kingdom of animals being burned in fields have had an impact on tourism here. Ambiguity about the effects of foot and mouth disease on human health must be ironed out. There is confusion, particularly in the United States, about the difference between BSE, foot and mouth disease and hoof and mouth disease, which must be clarified. I cannot understand the reason the Minister is waiting until the end of the month to travel to the United States. I urge him to travel tomorrow as those who want to book holidays need 28 days if they are to receive a refund on their airline tickets, etc.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a reassurance campaign here. People have rallied to the cause of agriculture. It is time to do the same for tourism. People's jobs are at risk. In tourism hot spots such as my home town of Killarney entire families are employed in tourism and facing months of uncertainty. It is crucial that workers who have had their jobs put at risk are also catered for and that their voice is heard. I suggest that representatives of workers should be included in the expert group. It may also be necessary to show some degree of leniency towards workers signing on as a result of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> When foot and mouth disease is firmly behind us, which I hope will be very soon, I suggest that we have an additional bank holiday on which we can hold our parades and stage a major festival to tell people that we are again on the road and welcome tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent Galway West, a constituency where so many people depend on an income from tourism. Almost every letter I receive opens by stating support for the national effort to prevent foot and mouth disease, which is encouraging and impressive. We still need a national effort to deal with the position we face. It was not helpful, however, when the Minister for Finance recently dismissed the possibility of compensation or responding to the plight of those who find themselves in difficulties, but who are not directly involved in agriculture. I have in mind people such as those in the Oughterard Tourist and Development Association, which has written to me and other Deputies indicating that their tourism season, which begins in March, April and May, has taken a very heavy hit. There are those who have borrowed money from banks and are finding it difficult to meet their commitments. Not just owners of establishments catering for the tourism industry, but those who work in the industry have lost out. The tourism sector provides a very important type of rural employment, be it in small guesthouses or small hotels. The people concerned could be helped through a mixture of local and national initiatives, for example, in relation to rates, VAT and PRSI, and through a State assisted promotion.</P>
      <P>I echo what Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, namely, that the response in Ireland, a gesture of unique national solidarity, is in contrast to that on the neighbouring island where people saw one sector of the economy as almost being in competition with another. The fact that there has been such solidarity from those who may not be directly involved in agriculture is impressive, but also requires a generous and flexible response on the part of Government. Now that the details of hardship and significant loss of income and employment have been made clear, I urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to make a case to the Minister for Finance to respond in a way which will encourage the continuance of this social cohesion and solidarity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue in the House. It provides me with an opportunity to acknowledge the support from all sides of the House, and what Deputy Higgins <Col N="135" /> described as unique solidarity. I have not ever experienced anything like the national effort and support which ensured that this virus was contained and prevented from doing enormous damage to the national economy. It was to be expected that the farming community would play a central role in the fight against the disease.</P>
      <P>However, the contribution made by sporting and cultural organisation, by the business community and the general public, the degree of disinfection, with hygiene arrangements at everything from pubs to funeral homes, was absolutely amazing. It was very important for our citizens to show this solidarity and support in the way they did. It extended from the farmer who scrupulously adhered to the hygiene regulations for the bio-security of his farm, and that is to be expected. It included the sporting organisations. The IRFU were the first to come to the Department and offered to postpone or cancel the Six Nations Championship. As it happened, Ireland had been doing quite well in that competition, having won its first two games. The FAI and the GAA followed suit, as did a whole range of cultural organisations, all supporting the national effort. Trade fairs and shows were cancelled and individuals postponed long-awaited holidays.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development received about 4,000 calls per day to the help line People rang to ask, for instance, if it was safe for a letter to be sent from Britain, in case the virus could be carried on stationery. It was a superb reaction from the public. Unusual details were noted, such as sheep crossing over roads, for instance.</P>
      <P>The public reaction to the crisis is symptomatic of the fact that Ireland is only relatively recently an urbanised society and that many urban dwellers are only one generation removed from the land. To this extent, the people have an innate sense of connection to the land and it has not yet been entirely eroded. There has been a tremendous response also from those who have no connection whatsoever with farming or with rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>So many aspects of the economy were affected. I met a photographer in Dublin a few days after the crisis began. He told me he was out of business because so many events connected with farming and animals had been cancelled. Printers lost business when events programmes were not needed. Everyone took the hurt and the pain in the hope that it would help prevent this plague from descending upon us&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is all the more important then <Col N="136" /> that those who have made the sacrifice in the national interest should know what they are fighting for. The Taoiseach referred to this when he said this is a once in a generation crisis. His words had a resonance to which people all over the country responded. By comparison, in the United Kingdom, primary agriculture represents just 0.8% of gross domestic product, 2% of employment and 4.6% of exports. In Ireland, primary agriculture is far more important to our economy as it represents 3.5% of gross domestic product, 7.3% of employment, and 5.6% of exports. These figures represent primary agriculture only. The food, drinks and tobacco sector is also a major contributor to national wealth and employment. Output from the sector currently stands at around £11 billion per annum, representing almost 25% of all industrial output. It provides direct employment for almost 50,000 people, with primary agriculture accounting for 10.5% of total employment. The industry provides indirect employment for 280,000 people, and food and drink exports in 2000 were valued at £5.4 billion.</P>
      <P>These impressive figures do not tell the whole story. In terms of gross output, the industry accounts for almost 50% of indigenous manufacturing industry and because it uses mainly native raw material, it is a significant contributor to our balance of payments. It accounts for 27% of net foreign earnings due to its strong internal links to the Irish economy and low import content. Due largely to its geographical spread, the industry makes a particular and substantial contribution to rural communities.</P>
      <P>The industry comprises more than 700 companies, and the main components of the industry are beef, dairy products and other meats. A significant development in recent years has been the growth of the prepared consumer foods sector. Despite the difficulties experienced in marketing for some sectors, the overall performance of the industry in recent years has been quite satisfactory. Since 1993, exports have increased by £2.2 billion. This is in no small measure due to the establishment of Bord Bia in 1994.  It is clear that any restrictions arising from the spread of foot and mouth disease would have a very serious impact on this sector, and therefore, on the whole economy. The spread of the disease would have a knock-on effect on many other sectors, notably the tourism sector. I am also acutely aware that the control measures now in place are causing considerable difficulties in this sector. This is a matter of serious concern to the Government and we are aware of the economic importance of the tourism sector which brings in more than £3 billion annually in foreign exchange earnings, and represents more than 4% of GNP.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that in the period up to 22 March, there had not been a new <Col N="137" /> outbreak in Northern Ireland since the Meigh case, nor had there been any case in the Republic. Then on 22 March, came confirmation of an outbreak here. We have had all the trauma since then, with the culling of animals and various restrictions. I thank the Garda Siochána, the army, various Government Departments and State agencies, and the Civil Defence. Various voluntary organisations have also been outstanding. They have all been working round the clock.</P>
      <P>In more recent times, the expert group chaired by Professor Michael Monaghan, has been meeting with various organisations. I am pleased that we can allow some restrictions to be eased so that normal business can proceed. We are not yet out of the woods. The British situation is extremely serious, as is the situation in the Netherlands. We must get through another fortnight and I appeal to everybody not to let down the guard, not to become complacent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the fine efforts of his Department, his staff, the army personnel, the Garda Siochána, the farm releases services, and the voluntary people who were involved in significant efforts to keep the plague of foot and mouth at bay. In the mid-1960s we were threatened with the arrival of foot and mouth disease and the Department and various State succeeded in repelling it. Times have changed quite significantly in the intervening period. Agriculture and farming is quite different today from the mid-1960s given the greater concentration of land, of livestock on farms and the general intensification of the industry. Obviously, the control measures call for a much greater intensity in 2001 than in the mid-1960s. Nonetheless, it is important that we recognise the role of Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development staff, gardaí, theColour RGB 170,0,0 Army and all involved who made a fine effort in combating the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>That is the background. We are now looking at the impact on the agricultural industry, particularly in the Cooley Peninsula but also in County Louth in general. With the outbreak of foot and mouth in south Armagh, and the proximity of the Cooley Peninsula and its sheep population, it was quite clear we were in a vulnerable position. There was a significant population of sheep in north Louth, and in Cooley in particular, in an area contiguous to the mountains immediately north of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of outbreaks in Britain helps us realise the serious implications of foot and mouth but we already have serious implications here such as the cull, the empathy of families with their livestock, the financial implications, and the loss of fine quality livestock through the cull. It will take time to build that quality back up again. Small and medium size farmers, some operating at part-time capacity, have been traumatised by what has happened and it is conceivable that <Col N="138" /> many of those farmers may find it difficult to re-commence their enterprises again.</P>
    <P>One of the striking features of the various briefing sessions organised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was the significant number of young farmers involved. That is encouraging and they will hopefully overcome the trauma and setback and strengthen their resolve to restock and recommence in business. The sheep sector is clearly a significant one in the local economy and complements inadequate off-farm income.</P>
    <P>The related sector of tourism has been severely affected. In our general analysis of the impact on the agricultural industry we need to keep an eye on the tourism industry, a relatively recent development. There has been significant capital investment in many tourism enterprises in the Cooley area and in Louth generally. These could be financially devastated if there were to be a continuation of the control measures for a long period. Hopefully, the support that we all hope will be advanced to them will help them get over this difficult period.</P>
    <P>I also find that transport companies, of which there are many in County Louth, are adversely affected with trucks parked in yards and drivers laid off. They are suffering financially and this is related to the tapering off of agricultural business. The inter-departmental group that is looking at the issues will hopefully identify areas where support can be extended and I look forward to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for the opportunity to speak. The outbreak in Ireland of foot and mouth disease has the potential to cause enormous damage to social, economic and cultural life. I do not underestimate the crisis which faces us all. I am fully aware of the severe difficulties which face the people of County Louth who have already put up with major difficulties. Great credit is due to all those involved in fighting to restrict the disease and to overcome its impact 24 hours per day in my constituency. I congratulate all on their spirit of solidarity with the rest of the country, despite huge tribulations. I am fully aware of the risk that the disease might yet spread and of the need for very tight controls.</P>
      <P>I do not overstate the Government's achievements in restricting the outbreak so far but we do not have to look far afield to see how much worse this outbreak might be or might yet become. I would like to take this opportunity to praise all those involved in this life-and-death struggle. In particular, great praise is due to all the officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who have been in County Louth for many weeks, to Louth County Council, to officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the officials of the North Eastern Health Board, and all those involved in supporting tourism, and to all other public agencies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all, I would like to praise the people of <Col N="139" /> Louth who have suffered, and are suffering, greatly from this outbreak, are doing everything possible to contain it and to get the county back on its feet as soon as possible. My heart goes out to the farming community in the north Louth area who have had to endure great trauma over the recent weeks.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware,Colour RGB 170,0,0 I established a task-force bringing together all the relevant agencies to identify the key issues which have arisen in Louth, including the provision of information, of training, of supports for those laid off from employment and the necessary financial alleviation measures to respond to the difficulties experienced by business in the area. In meetings with business and tourism interests, compensation for lost business has not been mentioned.</P>
    <P>However, we must ensure that there is appropriate flexibility in the collection of rates and taxes and I call on the financial institutions to be as sympathetic and flexible as possible in relation to business customers currently experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. I commend representatives of the Bank of Ireland who at a public meeting, attended by my colleague Deputy McDaid and I, said that there would be a level of forbearance on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>I understand, and the Taoiseach was involved in this prior to his visit to County Louth last Friday, that the Revenue Commissioners, as part of normal arrangements, would be prepared to look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis where temporary cash flow problems have emerged as a result of the present crisis. I have no doubt that local authorities, from my initial discussions with them, will adopt a similar sympathetic approach.</P>
    <P>Counselling has emerged as one of the particular needs of the area given the traumatic situation which has arisen for many in the farming community. Having travelled in the Cooley Peninsula over the past two weeks, it is astounding that at the start the area was full of sheep and new lambs while today there are virtually no animals. The issue of counselling and assistance is imperative. I have prioritised funding for counselling services in County Louth and I have strongly urged voluntary groups who are in a position to assist farm families in the provision of counselling to contact the family affairs unit of my Department. Already a number have come forward to help on this. Additional funding will be made available to groups in the area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and my colleagues, Deputies Walsh and McDaid, have already visited the area to see at first hand the situation on the ground. I thank them for this important mark of solidarity with the people of County Louth and those visits were greatly appreciated by the people. Deputy McDaid has already referred in detail to what has been done to support the tourism industry in the area and has outlined the tourism marketing initiative he is putting in place. I thank him for <Col N="140" /> his commitment that when the restrictions are lifted in County Louth a tourism marketing drive, specifically targeted at the area, will begin. I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by the people of Louth in getting people and services to come to County Louth. This difficulty has manifested itself in recent days. There appears to be a reluctance on the part of people in other parts of the country to deliver services to the county. While we must ensure that foot and mouth does not spread, life must go on. People should adopt a realistic approach to what can and cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Government has already established an expert group under the chairmanship of Professor Monaghan in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I encourage people, particularly in County Louth, if they are staging events, to contact Professor Monaghan's committee and to follow its advice.</P>
    <P>The Government is extremely conscious of the severe impact of foot and mouth disease in the Cooley area. We will soon finalise an initiative to help disadvantaged areas in rural Ireland. This will involve targeted investments and detailed planning for the development of services and infrastructure. The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion which deals with rural development met recently and has already agreed that Cooley will be included in this initiative on the basis that it has suffered dramatically in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The impact of foot and mouth disease is not confined to County Louth. My Department has responded speedily to additional claims for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and farm assist throughout the country. To date, there have been 733 additional claims for unemployment payments and farm assist directly arising from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, including 88 from County Louth itself.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, guidelines were issued to my Department officials to ensure that an appropriate response was available to people claiming in these circumstances. Signing on at social welfare local offices, branch offices or Garda stations was immediately relaxed as appropriate in order to ensure that it did not contribute to the spread of foot and mouth disease. In Louth a special unit was set up in Riverstown Mill in the Cooley area to deal with social welfare and other issues. Procedures have been put in place to ensure that claims can be dealt with in the safest and fastest way possible.</P>
    <P>Workers who were laid off as a result of foot and mouth disease may qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance, subject to the usual conditions for receipt of those payments. The deciding officers have been advised to have regard to the nature of lay-offs arising from foot and mouth disease and to the fact that the persons concerned may not have had a chance to consider other employment opportunities. In the circumstances it is expected that persons signing <Col N="141" /> on as a result of the foot and mouth disease scare would qualify for an unemployment payment subject to satisfying the relevant contribution conditions or means test.</P>
    <P>It is open to any farmer adversely affected either by foot and mouth disease or the precautions to avail of the supports under the farm assist scheme. In the Louth area a mail shot was issued to several hundred farmers advising them of their entitlements. Special arrangements have been introduced to cater for the assessment of means for different categories of farmers, as appropriate. In the case of farmers whose stock has been slaughtered, any compensation received will not be assessed as income or capital. Those farmers will be assessed with nil means from farming in that regard. In the case of farmers who cannot trade because their farms are locked up, they will be assessed with nil means and will have their position reviewed in six months. In the case of farmers who can only trade by permit, their means will be assessed on a current basis. That is allowing for any downturn in prices. The compensation, which is to be used for restocking purposes, will be disregarded. Agreement has been reached with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to fast track the investigation process of farm assist claims by way of seeking necessary information on farm incomes over the telephone from district veterinary offices.</P>
    <P>No Government could have ensured a speedier or more effective response than that which we have achieved both nationally and locally and this is universally recognised. I have already accepted a number of constructive suggestions from members of the Opposition to whom I have spoken privately during the past week or so. I compliment my fellow Oireachtas Members on the opposition benches in my constituency on their constructive efforts in the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform the House of the role my Department is playing in dealing with the threat posed by foot and mouth disease and with the serious issues associated with this crisis. My Department has been actively involved in a series of measures which I do not have time to outline. However, a review is ongoing in my Department to ensure that we deal with this continuing threat while being ever mindful of the effect measures are implementing in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forestry situation is being reviewed in the light of current circumstances. Limited site inspections resumed this week on the basis of the code of practice agreed between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, essential inspections by forestry inspectors and other inspection staff of my Department are curtailed. This will give rise to additional pressures when restrictions are lifted but Deputies can be assured that every <Col N="142" /> effort will be made to restore normality as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Preventing entry of the disease from the United Kingdom continues to be a primary concern. In the case of commercial sea ports all port companies and harbour authorities have put in place appropriate disinfection notification procedures and preventative measures in accordance with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My officials are also in ongoing direct communication with sea ports and relevant shipping companies to assist the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in monitoring the situation both in our own ports and in the relevant sea ports in the United Kingdom and France. The Department is also in regular contact with UK Departments with a view to ensuring that steps are taken to disinfect persons and vehicles leaving the UK for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Precautionary measures were also put in place at the five fishery harbour centres managed by my Department. Notices about the disease were erected in all the harbours requiring any vessel arriving from outside the State to inform the harbour master and carry out the necessary procedures. Contact was also made with the coastal local authorities advising them to put in place stringent precautionary measures at harbours and landing places under their control. My Department, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Customs and Excise, is developing a long-term plan to ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to deal with all the potential entry points at small piers, landing places and mooring buoys where yachts and other small leisure craft may enter during the touring and sailing season.</P>
    <P>In the case of angling, I made a by-law prohibiting angling nation wide with effect from 3 March. While this measure was fully in accordance with the overall precautionary approach adopted by the Government I was nevertheless aware that this restriction placed a considerable burden on the angling sector which is particularly vulnerable due to the niche nature of many enterprises. At the earliest opportunity, therefore, my Department sought the advice of the expert group and on 16 March I lifted the legal prohibition on angling with effect from 23 March. My Department has issued guidelines applicable to all involved in the angling sector from 23 March. Angling activity was permitted to resume from 23 March subject to non-entry on to agricultural land to which animals susceptible to the disease may have had access since 1 February. This easing of the restriction allows for the resumption of ordinary angling activity in many cases, in particular lake and sea angling.</P>
    <P>Angling is now being promoted in this country and overseas in accordance with the overall guidelines of the expert group. This will lessen the burden being borne by this sector while ensuring that appropriate precautions are in place. For example disinfection facilities have been provided at exit points to fisheries wherever <Col N="143" /> practicable and fishery boards are liaising with fishery owners and operators to identify safe access points to fisheries. In addition I am putting further proposals to the expert group to ensure the proper disinfection of all angling equipment being brought into the country. This may further ease the burden on the angling community.</P>
    <P>I consider these measures do all that is possible in the present circumstances to see that the impact of the foot and mouth disease prevention measures on angling is minimised. I will keep matters under active review as the situation develops and work closely with the relevant public bodies and interest groups to secure the position of the angling sector for the future.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the people of the Cooley Peninsula who have had to endure the effects of the virus at first hand and also with the countries in which there have been cases of foot and mouth disease, especially the United Kingdom where the farming community, as in the Cooley Peninsula, have suffered severe economic loss and stress.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleagues, Deputies Flanagan and Perry, on tabling the motion, the importance of which is clear given that half the Cabinet are present for the debate. I look forward to positive announcements on some of the suggestions made in the motion which calls on the Government to establish an economic sub-committee to deal with the current situation. I do not have to emphasise the need for such a committee given that the Minister has received deputations from the tourism industry, including hoteliers and guesthouse owners, all of whom have taken a hit. The Minister said on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; that he had a package ready.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that some restrictions have been lifted. We have to emphasise, however, the importance of restrictions at ports and along the Border. I compliment the Garda Síochána, the Army and all departmental officials who have put in many long hours in an effort to police our ports and the Border. If animals are not brought into the country, there is every chance that our efforts will succeed. History tells us how the disease came to the island. A repeat would be a disaster.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister on the easing of fishing restrictions. People in my area, especially around Lanesborough, had bookings for fishing holidays. Thankfully, the business has been restored. That people can fish off piers and boats is a sensible approach. They must, however, avoid crossing land. The Minister has made it clear that it is okay to fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those involved in the transport business and <Col N="144" /> the entertainment world are also affected by restrictions. That horse-racing is to resume in about two weeks' time is welcome news for Autotote in Ballymahon which has a contract with the Irish Racing Authority. The motion is all the more important given the various activities right across the board which have been affected.</P>
    <P>Until now the Government has concentrated on keeping out the disease. Now is the time to move forward, put a committee in place and have its package ready with a view to moving forward immediately. I look forward to hearing from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion which calls on the Government to establish a special task force to make an immediate economic impact assessment of the devastating effects on the economy and business due to foot and mouth disease. I compliment my colleagues, Deputies Flanagan and Jim Higgins, on tabling the motion. The Government will have to take effective measures to help the business community and the many industries which are finding it difficult to survive. Given that the tourism and food sectors have experienced difficulty, measures are needed to help them.</P>
      <P>The Government stated on many occasions that the real economic benefit to the west and rural Ireland, in general, is the promotion of the tourism industry which we view as having a significant role in the development of the west and rural Ireland. It is time that the Government stopped talking the talk and started walking the walk, because action is needed. It is easy for us to say what should be done, but when one is in government one has the opportunity to implement the necessary measures which the sectors in question require immediately.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Government look at issues such as the possibility of local authorities reducing commercial rates and ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to provide financial help for local authorities to meet any reduction in funding and that the Revenue Commissioners allow businesses extra time for the payment of VAT. These are matters in which the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government can become involved and measures which the Government sub-committee on foot and mouth disease should implement it as a matter of urgency. There is also a view that the Government should do a deal with the commercial banks, which are owed by businesses, on the deferral of interest payments, a matter the Government should take up as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of individuals in my constituency have contacted me. The boat hire business which has had to endure numerous cancellations is experiencing difficulty. Locoboat in Ballinamore, Emerald Star, Carrick Craft, and Riversdale Barges have lost all bookings for the Easter period due to the foot and mouth scare. This will have to be taken into consideration. The Depart<Col N="145" /> ment of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a major role to play and should be more proactive in making information available to those who have lost jobs in the short-term in livestock marts, the service industry and the tourism sector. I call on the Government to implement immediately some of the proposed measures to ease the burden on individuals who find themselves in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is timely and important. What has happened here is unprecedented in terms of its consequences, economic effects and the way in which a Government has had to cope and deal with it. As the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is aware, the tourism industry is strong, but it is also fragile. A consequence of foot and mouth disease is a damage limitation exercise and an attempt to salvage something for the remainder of the year. While it is fine for the Minister to say that we have to do this on the basis of ingenuity and patriotism, the stability of the industry depends on dollars, deutschmarks, francs, lira and pounds sterling. People in these countries who have decided to go elsewhere are unlikely to change their minds. We have to try to convince those who are undecided that they should come to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish to give the Minister an idea. The Genealogical Society of Ireland contacted me by e-mail. The society sent a ten-point bulletin to 1,600 contacts worldwide giving simple facts about foot and mouth disease to those who may fear contracting it. The bulletin explains why people should come to Ireland and outlines the fact that the country is open for tourism business.</P>
      <P>The Minister could contact chambers of commerce, Rotary clubs and Lions clubs, all of which are members of worldwide networks and which could send e-mails to their contacts across the world, particularly to those markets which are most important to Ireland. The Minister should ally this approach to his personal international onslaught. I expect to see him on CNN, ABC, CBS, BBC, TV5 and so on outlining why people should come to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also enlist the help of Eddie Jordan, one of our tourism ambassadors, and Irish golfers taking part in the US Masters at Augusta this weekend, an event which will have a worldwide television audience. He should ask these sportspeople to outline that people should have no fears about coming to Ireland. This is a damage limitation exercise and the Minister must ally his efforts to the marketing efforts of those in the tourism industry. That industry has inherent problems which the Minister will have to deal with at a later stage but for now the exercise is one of damage limitation and attempting to salvage something from the current situation. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours and I hope he takes my suggestion on board.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="146" />
    </P>
    <P>Ms O. Mitchell: In the time available I cannot go into specifics but this is the most critical juncture for our economy. Government action at this point will determine whether the Celtic tiger is still roaring when this crisis is over, even if it does so in a more muted manner.</P>
    <P>We all knew that the levels of growth experienced over the past six or seven years could not continue. We were also assured that the economic fundamentals were right and that the change would not result in a sharp decline in growth rates and a recession but that the levelling off would lead to comfortable, sustainable growth rates. We were further assured that this would be the case provided there was no unforeseen international catastrophe over which we had no control. However, this is what has occurred. No one predicted that foot and mouth disease would cause the Celtic tiger to falter.</P>
    <P>The agriculture and tourism sectors have taken the direct hit, as have sectors related to these industries through the supply chain or linkages. However, the knock-on effects will be such that every sector will suffer and every person in the country will experience some pain. The steps taken by the Government at this stage and how it responds to and handles this crisis have implications for everyone.</P>
    <P>There are two priorities now facing the Government. First, it must restore confidence in the economy. Confidence is what is most under threat and any loss of confidence will have long-term implications when foot and mouth disease is but a memory. Other factors affect confidence in the economy. However, the manner in which confidence has ebbed in every sector since the first announcement regarding foot and mouth disease has been phenomenal. The Government's prime objective must be to restore confidence.</P>
    <P>The only way to restore this confidence is for the Government to show that it has a handle on this problem, that it has a plan of action and that it intends to show leadership in restoring confidence. This requires more than the placing of a ring of steel around County Louth. As outlined in the motion, it primarily requires identifying the sectors, industries and individual businesses which are suffering the most so a targeted package of measures can rapidly be put in place. This is not a request for a kind of setaside for every business. However, it seeks to ensure that, when the crisis is over, the infrastructure of every sector will still exist and that product providers will survive to employ those being laid off. This objective may require direct or indirect financial support. However, it mostly requires reassuring business that it is worthwhile trying to trade through this crisis, that there is a future and that the Celtic tiger will stagger back to its feet. The Government must recognise that there is a crisis. It must have a plan to deal with the crisis and the determination to implement that plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Belton, Flanagan, Perry and Jim Higgins for tabling this <Col N="147" /> timely and well thought out motion which had to be raised in the House. I congratulate the whole country. This is the first time since the national emergency that the entire country pulled together. We had lost the meaning of Ireland because people had become selfish. However, on this occasion people put the country first, for which they must be complimented.</P>
      <P>People are paying a high price for this situation. Two years ago as junior spokesperson on agriculture, I tabled questions to the then Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance regarding the smuggling of sheep into the country. Two days later I received an apology from the Minister. The only newspaper which covered this story at the time was the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> which I compliment. The journal took this issue up again last week. However, two years after I raised this issue we have done nothing about those smuggling sheep who have created the greatest disaster to hit the country.</P>
      <P>There are 11 hotels in Westport and thousands of people in the area are involved in tourism. I spoke to Lord Altamont last week who stated that he has to pay insurance premiums of £75,000 for the next few months regardless of whether one person or 35,000 people visit Westport House. He employs 18 people and further staff are taken on for the summer months.</P>
      <P>The 11 hotels in Westport have lost business. St. Patrick's weekend this year was the quietest ever in the town. Thousands of visitors normally come to the town. From next week on one could normally walk through the town and not know whether one was in New York, Amsterdam or Chicago because of the number of visitors. I walked through Westport last Saturday and one would know one was in a town in the west because the streets were so quiet.</P>
      <P>The Government must take on the county and urban councils and outline that the current situation has to be taken into consideration next December when rates are due. Hotels which only open for six months should not have to pay rates this year. The Minister should place an embargo on rates and give businesses a chance to survive. Many of these businesses depend on the summer trade and will be affected.</P>

      <P>Conflicting messages are emanating from different Departments regarding the opening of tourism sites and monuments. This matter should be clarified by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This is no fault of the Minister or the Department but various operators have outlined that the situation needs to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each tourism county should establish its own task force to communicate messages to various tourism interests. Such a task force was established in Kerry today which can communicate guidelines and directives from Departments to <Col N="148" /> local operators. This mechanism will be very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the negative messages which the national media has sent to the UK and, in particular, the US. I will give the House one example. The chief executive of the Rose of Tralee Festival was contacted last week by a number of people in America who said they were not coming to Ireland because they feared the consequences of foot and mouth disease and its health implications. Through Bord Fáilte, the Department will have to embark on a major blitz of the American market to provide the correct information and to outline that neither Ireland nor the Ring of Kerry are closed. The Minister will have to implement a huge media blitz on our major markets to ensure this misinformation, much of it put out by our own media is cleared up. I am not media-bashing &ndash; this is what happened.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in the industry, especially among the smaller operators, that they are being isolated. I received an e-mail from an operator who organises walking holidays last week and I had a similar one this evening. She said: </P>
    <P>Dear Jimmy, I can't hold my silence anymore. I just want to know what is being done or can be done to help the likes of ourselves during this foot and mouth crisis. We have already refunded all clients due to come on holidays with us in March and April. We have to swallow the administrative charges of booking and then cancelling all of these holidays. We are now looking at May clients and wondering if we will have to cancel all of these as well. In order to keep goodwill with our clients, we must give full refunds so we are losing money hand over fist. In order to keep goodwill with farmers&ndash;</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to briefly contribute to this debate. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, has contributed and we and other colleagues will have an opportunity tomorrow morning to debate this in greater detail at a specially convened meeting of the social affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other colleagues have said, this disease will have huge effect not only on the tourism sector, but on the transport sector, the meat processing sector and many other sectors of the economy. We have to be fully aware of those effects and specifically aware that many people will find themselves in a vulnerable position over the coming weeks in trying to understand, or be aware, of their social welfare entitlements. It is alarming to hear from the Minister, Deputy Ahern, that already this week, in excess of 700 people have <Col N="149" /> signed on for specific help from social welfare offices throughout the country. That is a threefold increase on the figures presented to the House only two weeks ago when the figure was 262. As the number of cases of this terrible disease rise in the United Kingdom so too does the number seeking social welfare help and assistance in this country. It was only on 12 March that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs asked local offices to track them.</P>
    <P>I have two specific recommendations. I call on the Government to drop the criteria whereby applicants for unemployment assistance must be &ldquo;genuinely looking for work&rdquo;. That needs to be dropped quickly. It is unacceptable that people in exposed parts of the economy should have to immediately find work. It is equally unacceptable that it is taking between two to three weeks for applications for unemployment assistance, which, I understand, is the majority of cases, to be processed. During that period, people must go to the community welfare officer from whom they attempt to receive paltry sums of money. We are talking about families who will be living on £80 per week for the next few months as a result of this crisis and no consideration has been given to that.</P>
    <P>I call for a tax rebate for many of those people in the affected parts of the economy &ndash; those who are unable to get unemployment benefit or assistance, those who will not get any benefits as a result of this crisis and those who are not included in the 700 figure.</P>

      <P>In the first two weeks of the foot and mouth disease restrictions, the industry has suffered a loss of more than £33 million in cancellations and forward bookings since 1 March are down by at least £12 million compared to the same period last year. Already, 1,350 full-time jobs have been lost. If the current rate of forward booking does not improve, this will result in 150 jobs per week being added to the total. If the present circumstances continue, at least 20,000 jobs are at risk in the hotel and guest house sector alone which employs 60,000.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to implement a number of immediate measures to ease the hardship being experienced by the hotel and guest house industry and its staff. These include: establishing a special fund of £15 million to £20 million to promote Ireland abroad; removing VAT on accommodation and food sales from March to June 2001 and introducing an interest subvention of low interest loan schemes for hotels and guest houses. An exemption from local authority rates for affected business has also been requested by the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most serious crisis faced by the industry in the past 25 years and it affects most especially the small family run properties which represent 70% of all hotels and guest houses in the country. The crisis has proven that the hotel and guest house industry is the first sector of the economy to take a direct hit and suffer from the <Col N="150" /> foot and mouth disease outbreak. In excess of 3,000 events, meetings and conferences have been cancelled. Other sectors may be able to defer their economic activities but a night in a hotel room could be termed a perishable commodity. Last night's empty hotel room cannot be sold afterwards even at a massively reduced price.</P>
    <P>A fund of £15 million to £20 million should be allocated to promote Ireland as a country with only an isolated outbreak of foot and mouth disease where numerous activities and attractions are available to enjoy. Ireland can be portrayed as a country whose food is safe and wholesome and free from any human disease risks. The message abroad should suggest that preventative measures are not causing inconvenience but are necessary to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. Hotels and guest houses should be entitled to a full rebate of the local authority rates for 2001. They employ more than 60,000 people and, as a sector within tourism, they directly contribute more than £1.2 billion &ndash; 2% of the gross national product. Economists estimate that every £1 million of hotel revenue provides 27 direct jobs in hotels with further indirect jobs in the economy. I call on the Minister to take action. Pious words butters no bread. What is needed is action and action speaks louder than words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

      <P>Everybody has spoken about the great degree of solidarity around the country and I heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development speak of how people had co-operated. Are we reciprocating that solidarity at Government level? Is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development aware that in Cavan, applicants for the control of farmyard pollution grant are waiting for £1.670 million in funding? The Department of Finance is not providing funding and whatever funding is being provided is being provided on a drip feed basis. Will the Minister talk to the Minister for Finance as a matter of priority and provide funding for many of those farmers who have approached me, who are hard pressed at the moment and who are finding things extremely difficult? Will he talk to the ESB transmission team in regard to a relaxation of the criteria that applies? People, including many young people, paid a connection fee of up to £1,000 six months ago and yet they cannot get a connection. Surely it is possible to come up with measures to eradicate that type of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the tourism industry. I have watched the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on television debate what should or should not be done. Is it not time we had some tangible evidence of ways we could help the hard pressed industry? We are all receiving letters from hotels and from people in our constituencies saying how hard pressed they are. I remember a time when our economy was not so buoyant and there was a scheme called the employee incentive scheme which encouraged employers to take on people. The employer was <Col N="151" /> paid an incentive. To retain vital jobs in the hard pressed tourism industry, the Minister should consider an employee retention scheme. A degree of imagination is required. Consultation with local authorities is necessary given that many of us are members of local authorities. Deputy Sheehan is correct that VAT refunds should be provided. We are not doing enough to those affected to help them out. We are congratulating them but we are forgetting about reciprocating their efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations expressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his officials for their dedicated efforts at containing the outbreak of foot and mouth disease to a single area in Ireland. Every Member recognises the hardship borne by people throughout the country, but particularly in the north Louth area. We must also recognise, however, that a widespread outbreak of the disease could threaten the economic well-being of the entire country and adversely affect virtually every citizen. There is general agreement for that reason that we must continue to be vigilant and to take every step to ensure the disease does not spread beyond the area in which it has been confined to date.</P>
      <P>On 28 February, I announced that, as a precautionary measure against the threat of foot and mouth disease, all visitor facilities at national parks, nature reserves, national monuments and historic properties, owned or operated by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, would be closed to the public until further notice, both in rural and urban areas where there are live animals. A total of 24 different locations throughout Ireland were involved. In Dublin, Kilmainham Gaol, the Casino, Marino, the National Botanic Gardens, St. Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park remained open, as did the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department such as the National Museum, the National Gallery and the National Library.</P>
      <P>However, notices were posted at all heritage sites owned or operated by my Department requesting visitors not to enter these sites to minimise the risks associated with this disease. In addition, I suspended all unessential farm visits or holding of public meetings by Dúchas and other departmental staff for the duration of the crisis. This included visits by inspectors in Gaeltacht areas. I also announced that close liaison would be maintained with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and that the situation would be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full co-operation of the public was requested and generally received in the implementation of those necessary precautionary measures. While I was conscious that closure of heritage sites could have adverse effects for the tourism industry, I had to balance that with the national need to do everything possible to <Col N="152" /> prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease and with my own responsibilities as Minister in relation to the protection of wildlife.</P>
    <P>I was pleased, however, that on 16 March, following acceptance by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of recommendations by the expert group on foot and mouth disease controls, I was able to announce the re-opening of visitor facilities in Kilkenny Castle, Kilkenny city and the Rock of Cashel, County Tipperary. At that time, I requested my Department to undertake an immediate and full review of the position regarding visitor facilities at other heritage sites in the light of the recommendations of the expert group. On completion of the review and following consultation with the expert group in regard to the opening to visitors of certain specific sites under the aegis of my Department, I announced that a further 11 sites would re-open from 28 March.</P>
    <P>The expert group considered that, as there were no susceptible animals using these sites and susceptible animals did not have access to them since 1 February 2001, the opening of the sites did not pose a risk in terms of foot and mouth disease. However, visitors are required to comply fully with all precautions at these sites. In particular, people must use the disinfection facilities which are in place and they may not go outside the sites on to farmland. Persons from infected areas or visitors who are high risk, having been in contact with susceptible animals, should not visit these sites.</P>
    <P>The question of opening other sites operated by Dúchas has been kept under constant review with the expert group and as a result I decided to open a further three heritage sites with effect from 1 April and two with effect from 8 April. I will continue to keep the question of opening further heritage sites under close review, having regard to the advice of the expert group and keeping in mind at all times the paramount importance of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease. I expect to announce in the next few days the opening of further heritage sites in time for Easter.</P>
    <P>However, a number of sites managed by my Department contain susceptible animals, in particular, the deer herds in Killarney National Park, Wicklow Mountains National Park and Glenveagh National Park. These are major national assets and it is my duty, as Minister, to protect them. These sites must remain closed for the time being in accordance with the advice of the expert group. My Department is engaged in a programme of temporary fencing to fence out deer and other susceptible animals from the visitor centres in these areas. We are doing everything to reopen these sites on foot of the expert group's advice.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and everyone in the House for their tremendous co-operation. The Minister and the President will visit the United States later this <Col N="153" /> month and will take the opportunity to invite our friends in the US to visit Ireland and enjoy the tourist facilities that are available following the taking of the necessary precautions.</P>

      <P>I call on people who have information on sheep smuggling or political corruption to come forward. Regrettably an article was published in a Sunday newspaper under the heading &ldquo;Beware they are trying to turn us into a nation of snitches&rdquo;. The article did not strictly relate to the foot and mouth disease but it is important that those who have been involved in wrongdoing are brought to justice. It is regrettable that there is a hangover from our colonial past in that people are afraid to approach the authorities with information.</P>
      <P>I do not want to criticise the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but I cannot join in the back slapping because there were no contingency plans in place when the foot and mouth outbreak hit Ireland. It was a miracle that the disease did not spread throughout the country. There were many shortcomings at the beginning of the outbreak. The shop closed down then but contingency plans are needed for crises such as a foot and mouth outbreak or nuclear fall-out from Sellafield. Local authorities have emergency plans but they contain telephone numbers which are not even correct.</P>
      <P>There has been a negative impact on the economy and people have suffered directly and indirectly. The Minister referred to the national park at Glenadalough, which is probably the hub of tourism in County Wicklow. When I visited there in January the Glendalough Hotel, the Wicklow Heather and the Laragh Inn were full, but they are empty now and it is like a morgue in the village. Facilities should not be re-opened <i>en masse</i>, at least until 19 April, but the visitor centre at Glendalough could be opened in the next few weeks and I hope the Minister will examine that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation referred to people holidaying at home and doing what they can for local businesses. It is pay-back time. Reference is made to national spirit. The Government and the House should send a signal to the public. The foot and mouth crisis has had little impact on some people's lives but they still made sacrifices and we should examine the notion of providing a number of additional national holidays during the summer, as proposed by Deputy Flanagan. There are no national holidays in July or September and an extra bank holiday could be provided in both <Col N="154" /> months. It would not cost much and would be a positive signal to the people. The proposals would be welcomed throughout society. The Government should take it on board as it would be a sign of appreciation to the population at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion calls for the establishment of a task force to carry out an economic impact assessment of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. ITIC has said to date that £223 million has been lost in revenue to the tourism sector. If the situation continues, up to £470 million will be lost by August and it could be worse unless there is support for the domestic market. I am sorry for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation because the tourism industry is in serious trouble and he is not getting the support from his Cabinet colleagues that I would expect.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, last night told us all to be happy and optimistic. He does not have a clue about what is happening, and that is absolutely frightening. He said the crisis did not seem to have had any impact on employment. Where is he coming from? Will the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation inform him what tourism interests are telling him and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Jobs have been lost and thousands more are at risk unless something is done. In Wales, for example, the government has made £12 million available for rates reduction. In effect, it has waived rates. There have been many other initiatives both there and in Scotland. Why is that not happening here?</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister sitting in this Chamber? Why is he not abroad leading a delegation? The work should be done now, not at the end of this month. The Minister said last night that £3 million is being made available through savings from Bord Fáilte. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is not providing anything. The Minister has scraped together some savings. He was not prepared to admit, until I interrupted him, that there might be more. A sum of £3 million is peanuts in such a huge sector.</P>
      <P>We want to support the Minister. We want him to go to the Cabinet and bang the table because jobs and an industry are at risk. The Minister is well aware that if many of these businesses go to the wall, they will not be able to reopen. The people in this sector are entrepreneurs, self employed people who took risks, and we must support them. We have a fine product and a good industry. We have succeeded in keeping foot and mouth disease out of the country so the Minister should battle for his sector. He should not be afraid of the Minister for Finance and others. He must fight for his sector and show us some results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat ironic that a plague which primarily afflicts the agricultural sector will inflict more severe damage on a non-agricultural sector of the economy. Government backbench<Col N="155" /> ers have been involved in an orgy of self congratulation and back slapping of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the effort that has been made. However, their focus should have been on the sectors of the economy that are taking the greatest hit.</P>
      <P>A national sense of purpose has been reflected both inside and outside the House. I pay tribute to Deputy Flanagan for putting down this motion and also to my colleague, Deputy Dukes, the Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture. Deputy Dukes has given us the Tallaght strategy, mark two, something one could not expect from Fianna Fáil if its members were on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>There is a national consensus about how the economy is afflicted. However, with a gratuitous backslap of the hand, the Taoiseach, in his new decisive mode, dismissed compensation for any sector other than the farming community. Good luck to the farming community. Those who lose their animals will be directly compensated. The Minister for Finance, speaking from Brussels early in this crisis, gave an equally dismissive wave of his hand by saying there will not be compensation for any other sector.</P>
      <P>Since this debacle began the Minister, Deputy McDaid's, voice has been practically unheard even though the sector of the economy for which he is responsible is taking the biggest hit. That is regrettable. Rather than engage in the token congratulations for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which were offered by all Government speakers, the Minister should articulate the case for those who are directly in the firing line. Jobs have been, are being and will be lost and some mechanism must be put in place to compensate people.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of a successful economy? It is not an end in itself but a means to an end. It should minimise the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis on the tourism sector. My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, read a letter from a constituent. All Members of the House have received such letters. Rural tourism will be the hardest hit sector, whether it is walking tours, rural hotels or bed and breakfasts. Deputy Sheehan outlined the financial losses in some detail but there is not an iota of information from the Minister's Department on how to minimise the disruption and the long-term damage to the industry. It is time the public's view that only the farmers will be compensated is corrected and that those who are worst affected are put to the forefront in terms of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are all the Fianna Fáil back slapping backbenchers now? I do not see them in the Chamber. Due to the ongoing tension concerning the possibility of a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development continues to escape criticism in this debate. I wish to say a number of things to the Minister but I will refrain from saying them tonight. There will be another <Col N="156" /> time to speak about the inadequate precautions and the serious irregularities that occurred in recent years with regard to livestock. I will deal with that issue then in a more thorough fashion.</P>
      <P>The debate tonight is about the effects on tourism. Conflicting considerations are having a serious effect on the tourism industry and are leading to tensions in certain areas. They have arisen in Galway in the angling tourism areas where landowners are still naturally reluctant to let anglers on to their land. They have a great fear of visitors crossing their land. A decade ago in the lake areas of Galway there was the famous rod licence dispute when anglers stayed off the lakes for two years. They are prepared to stay away from the lakes again rather than risk the possibility of spreading foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>Everybody acknowledges the efforts of all sections of the community, particularly the hotels, bed and breakfasts and guest houses in the tourism sector. The Government should give recognition to the interests that have suffered a great deal because of the necessary restrictions. Rates should be waived, as should the water charges and the contributions of £170 to the tourism accommodation approval scheme. It is in the Minister's hands.</P>

      <P>I thank my 20 Fine Gael colleagues who contributed to this debate in a constructive and positive manner. Five Ministers made contributions. While all of them referred to the crisis and the role of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, none mentioned a package. It was a little like the children's game, pass the parcel. The five Ministers passed the package around but nobody opened it. None of them did anything to allay people's fears about the fall-out and economic consequences of the foot and mouth disease crisis. I am grateful for the support of the Labour Party and the Green Party.</P>
      <P>The Government has no appreciation of the serious difficulties being encountered by business and enterprise in this crisis. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have dismissed all claims for compensation in an arrogant and high handed manner. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation acknowledged that losses in the industry might amount to £500 million. Thousands of jobs and livelihoods hang in the balance, particularly in rural Ireland. There must be a rescheduling of restrictions and regulations that will allow for a proper balance to be achieved between reducing the risk of the spread of the disease on the one hand and jeopardising jobs on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall-out to date is clear. The economic cost on public utilities such as the ESB and Bord Gáis is substantial and I hope both companies can resume normal work immediately. The contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation last night was uninspiring and disappointing, as is his amendment. He seems to be adopting a semi-detached stance. His refusal to <Col N="157" /> contemplate compensation is indicative of a weakness at Cabinet. A cost benefit analysis or economic impact assessment must be undertaken immediately. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a crucial role to play in this crisis but that was missed in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes that following an accurate economic impact assessment, the following initiatives should be contemplated. First, there should be rebates of PAYE, PRSI and VAT by way of temporary relief. Second, there should be an initiative by Government to ensure sympathetic consideration is given by the banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners. The statement of the Irish Bankers' Federation is welcome and I look forward to monitoring the careful and sympathetic consideration that has been promised to businesses in difficulty. Third, there must be a rebate of council rates for suffering businesses. The possibility of an extra public holiday later in the year should be considered while, even more importantly, there should be an aggressive diplomatic marketing programme, particularly in the tourism and food export sectors. It should loudly proclaim that Ireland is open and safe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> There is a need for a comprehensive statement by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation dealing with the upcoming Easter holiday period. There have been conflicting statements in which the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation invites people to holiday here while his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, tells people to stay away from rural areas. That is damaging and must stop. There is no co-ordination, no clarity and no initiatives.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a balance in the fight against the disease. We accept that. The tourism industry employs 150,000 people and earns £3 billion in receipts. It represents 4% of GNP but it is now in crisis. One need only listen to the speeches of my 20 Fine Gael colleagues, in particular that of Deputy Higgins, our spokesman. Other businesses and enterprises in both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors are also facing huge difficulties. The Government is too laid back regarding the economic consequences and must take a far more vigorous approach such as that envisaged by the Fine Gael motion, which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I support a positive outcome to this matter when it comes before the people. The Constitution belongs to them and they must be fully informed about proposed changes to it. They are not informed about this referendum. A survey of the last referendum indicated that those who voted no did so because they were unsure about what was involved. They adopted the well worn phrase, &ldquo;When in doubt say nought&rdquo;.  This will happen again on the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>The treaty is very important for this country, Europe and applicant countries. The public can only be informed if the Government and the Minister are prepared to spend the money allocated for this purpose, both for and against. The national media are receiving their share of Government expenditure on the referendum, but the Minister should remember that in the foot and mouth crisis it was the provincial press and local radio which played a major role in informing the public about what was involved and how to go about combating the disease to ensure it did not reach this country and spread. In that regard the local media have done a marvellous job of work in informing the public which has responded. Here is an opportunity for the Minister to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and recognise the role the provincial press and local radio can play in these matters. The position papers regarding this debate should be sent to the provincial newspapers and if space must be bought, that should be done. It would give them some return on their good work.</P>
      <P>I fully support the enlargement of the European Union, the population of which is 350 million and to which we have had free access for the past 30 years. This has brought major benefits to this country. Enlargement would result in a population of over 550 million.</P>
      <P>Recently I saw television footage of Poland, which is seeking entry to the European Union. It brought me back to the Ireland of the 1950s and 1960s. I saw horses ploughing in the fields and children and women dropping potatoes into the drills, all of which took place in Ireland before we joined the EEC. Our agricultural production was mechanised on entry and we developed further.</P>
      <P>Our story is one of tremendous success. While we have benefited enormously from membership of the European Union, we have been very successful also. We should be thankful that we were welcomed with open arms into the EEC. One must recognise the benefits which accrued from membership such as all the payments we received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan in the Border region was designated a severely handicapped area. Grants on top of those available to disadvantaged areas were of enormous benefit in lifting the region. While we have not caught up with the rest of the country, we are making progress. Because of enlargement and other <Col N="161" /> developing issues I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will not say that we have received sufficient funding. That is not the case and the Minister lives close enough to us to recognise this. However, we are not ones who go with cap in hand begging all the time. We will show the Minister the benefits of the grants which we have received and the country as a whole can then show the people of Europe our success story.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the poorer countries such as Poland which are seeking membership. In Ireland there are agriculture and industry graduates who can travel to these countries and show the people how our success was achieved. We would then be playing our part as fully fledged members of the European Union. Otherwise, we would be neglecting our role. We would not be repaying our debt or saying that we are extremely grateful for what we have achieved. We should draw attention to our success story.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister took an independent line recently for which he had his knuckles rapped. I am not altogether against the independent line. We should not be seen to be totally buried within the European Union. We should have an independent voice because we are an independent nation within the EU structure. We have our own identity which we should maintain.</P>
    <P>I understand we will lose our Commissioner under the new treaty. The current Irish Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, is an outstanding man. He has done a marvellous job in his current food safety position in the difficult context of the foot and mouth crisis in Britain which is spreading to Europe. He, certainly, has lifted the profile of this country. All our previous Commissioners were excellent people also.</P>
    <P>There was a danger that Ireland would be used as a drop-off point by drug traffickers and peddlers from mainland Europe, but the co-operation between the Garda and police forces all over Europe has ensured we have been able to deal with the problem to some extent. The most recent discovery of drugs worth in the region of £2 million was alarming. That could not have happened if the Garda, which has done marvellous work, had not had the co-operation of police forces in Europe. Our young people are outgoing and have disposable income. It is recognised in Europe that the economy is booming and we are seen as a target area. If we had not played our part as fully fledged members of the European Union and not received the co-operation of European police forces, this country would have been riddled with drugs and our young people would have been decimated. We must recognise, therefore, that we have gained not only from the benefits of Europe, but also from working with the other member states. In return, we must play our part to show, in some way, that we appreciate what has been done.</P>
    <P>For this reason, it is important that the public is fully informed. I would not like to see people going into the polling booth like the fellow who asked the crowd who was playing, having fol<Col N="162" /> lowed them to the football match. I do not want people going into the polling booth not knowing exactly what is involved and on what they are voting. That is not good enough and unacceptable. A better informed public is a one which will better understand the issues involved and be more co-operative. The Government should spell out the system of European grants and the benefits which we have enjoyed, given the current crisis when the farming community is practically on its knees because of the restrictions in place. Numerous farmers have contacted me about overdue headage payments or some backlog. They were watching for their cheque in the post, which still has a role to play and which got them over this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Ireland's road structure has developed enormously with the help of the European Union. Major roads and bypasses have been constructed, as the Minister will be aware having been present at the opening of the N3 bypass of Cavan and my village, Butler's Bridge, to Belturbet. It is a marvellous success story which could not have been undertaken without substantial EU funding. The moneys were provided for the work and the community has benefited enormously. While further stretches of the road will continue to be improved, I accept that the best days of European funding are over. We are now capable of paddling our own canoe. We can develop our own areas and show the benefits we have accrued from the work done. This information can be of benefit to other member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, not to forget that the local press and media can play their part in the issue.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Haughey.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which seeks the approval of the people for the constitutional changes necessary to allow us to ratify the Treaty of Nice. About two years ago we invited Mr. Verstringer, who was visiting Ireland at the time, to the launch of the water services investment programme in Killaloe. He was a good friend of Ireland. He secured the establishment of the Cohesion Fund for Ireland, something for which we should always be grateful. He reminded us of how much Europe was doing for Ireland and in the course of my remarks, because we were in a very historic part of Ireland with monastic traditions, I reminded Mr. Verstringer that in the Dark Ages when civilisation was almost wiped out in Europe it was the Irish who maintained the light of civilisation. I said that we were merely getting something back from Europe.</P>
      <P>We, in this House, do not need to be reminded of the benefits we have enjoyed since we took out membership of the European Economic Community as it was then known in 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he did. He had a more realistic view of us at that stage.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Nice, rather than looking back as I was doing on that occasion, looks to the future of the European Union and all its peoples, including the people of Ireland. It is time we looked forward again. Whatever debt might have existed, when we needed Europe's help and assistance, has been repaid. We must look to the future. A positive decision by our people on the constitutional amendment, which this Bill proposes, is essential. A positive decision would be a telling indicator of our maturity and self-confidence as a modern and forward looking nation. It will also be a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Europe for the assistance we got when we needed it. If there was only one lesson that could be learned from our membership of the European Union to date, it would be that nations are judged not only for their actions on an individual basis but on the contribution they can make to the wider community to which they belong. We have benefited from the Union, but we have also contributed greatly to it and given other member states the benefit of our unique viewpoint based as we are on the western periphery of the Union. The European movement has benefited enormously from our input. This is a testament to the professionalism and dedication of members from all sides of the political spectrum. It is also a tribute to our excellent public service. Any one of our European colleagues who have come into contact with Ireland, through the activities of the Union, would confirm that is the case.</P>
      <P>The benefits of membership of the Union deserve to be acknowledged despite our facing major infrastructural deficits. We have invested heavily over the years in programmes such as roads and sanitary services with the benefit of EU assistance. I am sure Members will agree that the number of projects they have seen that bear the distinctive EU logo are almost incapable of being counted. That is an example of the level of EU funding this country has received for necessary projects. My Department received more than £1.85 billion directly from the EU in period from 1995 to 2000. The benefits of membership do not simply come from cash transfers. Membership of the Union has also conferred on us access to a free market of 370 million people. That has clearly helped to satisfy the appetite of the Celtic tiger hungry for export markets without which we could not survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be truly said that our membership of the European Union has been very good for Ireland. It has provided us with the friendship and support that was necessary for this country to advance to a position of unprecedented economic prosperity. In looking to the future, the Treaty of Nice sets out to provide a structure that will enable countries currently outside the Union to make their <Col N="164" /> contribution and to advance themselves just as we have done. Just as the treaty is an opportunity to advance the cause of the States currently outside the Union, it is also an opportunity to further advance the cause of countries within that Union. Through enlargement, the treaty will strengthen the position of Europe in relation to the rest of the world. Nobody will doubt the good of strengthening the position of Europe inc. in economic terms.</P>
    <P>In a wider context, we should seek to strengthen our position on the development of policies on global issues. One global issue that comes to mind immediately lies in the environmental area and has been topical in recent weeks. The implementation of measures to limit emissions of greenhouse gases is an international as well as a national issue. Climate change is real; it is happening now and the position will get worse. Emissions from the developed world are the primary contributor to global climate change and developed countries must take the first meaningful steps to reduce emissions. I do not doubt the necessity to pursue and attain the targets for limitations of greenhouse gases as agreed in the Kyoto Protocol. My view is shared by fellow Environment Ministers in the EU. However, while remaining wedded to working with friends and allies on means to address global climate change, the US no longer supports the Kyoto Protocol and we, in the EU, must seek to influence their view and change their mind.</P>
    <P>To influence others, particularly some nations as large as the US, one's voice must be heard. There can be little doubt that while we have quite an amount of influence in certain circles in the US, an enlarged European Union would have a louder voice globally than the Union as it is currently constituted, a more influential voice and one that would be better heard. That voice could be used to influence policies on issues such as climate change, but it could also be used for the good of the world on a range of issues, as we have done within the UN.</P>
    <P>The wider unity within Europe can also be used for the good of Europe. It is all too easy to forget the trauma Europe suffered during two World Wars and the heartbreak of partition that followed, not to mention the horrific events that unfolded more recently in the Balkans. The record of the European Union in providing structures within which former enemies can be reconciled and grow is there for all to see. An enlarged Union holds the tantalising promise of continuing peace and prosperity for the majority of people in Europe. That is a prospect we cannot let slip through our hands. I am convinced the people of Ireland will recognise that and exercise their responsibility to amend our Constitution to enable the process of EU enlargement to go forward.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice provides the basis for enlargement while maintaining protection of this country's essential interests. I fully support the Bill and I will follow through on that during the <Col N="165" /> referendum campaign. I urge all like minded Members to act in the same manner.</P>
    <P>I agree with what was said by Deputy Boylan about the importance of ensuring the people get information on the treaty and of using media such as the local radio and local newspapers to ensure they do. Substantial sums of money have been made available to the Referendum Commission for the purposes of disseminating information on the Nice treaty, but there is an obligation on each and every one of us in this House to ensure that we, too, use the positions we have to ensure that information gets to as many people as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for sharing his time with me. I am delighted to have this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, which, if passed, will allow us to ratify the Treaty of Nice. The decision of the Government to hold a referendum is correct. I accept it received legal advice to the effect that a referendum is needed. Nevertheless, the legal advice given took a cautious approach and it has been argued by others that a referendum is not strictly necessary. It seems Ireland will be the only country in the EU that will hold a referendum on this issue. That presents us with a unique opportunity to clearly demonstrate yet again our commitment to the European ideal and poses for us a special challenge.</P>
      <P>The Government proposes to hold three other referendums on the same day, the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, dealing with the death penalty, the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, dealing with judicial misconduct and the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, dealing with the International Criminal Court. There is a danger that the electorate may become confused about these issues and not turn out or, if they do, vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; simply because they do not know. We, as political leaders, must do everything possible to avoid that happening and everything to clearly explain the issues to the people. A fall in voter turnout generally must not be allowed to result in the Treaty of Nice being rejected, as that would be disastrous for us. I am glad a proposed amendment to the Constitution in relation to the abortion issue is not being held on the same day as these referendums. This issue deserves to be debated on its own given its complexity and it is also the wish of the pro-life groups that this should be the case. I hope that referendum will take place during the lifetime of this Government as promised and I look forward to seeing the proposals from the Minister for Health and Children in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four referendums on Europe have taken place in this country. There was the accession referendum, the referendum on the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty referendum and the one on the Amsterdam Treaty. On each occasion the percentage &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote has decreased. This decrease must be reversed and it is the job of all <Col N="166" /> of us to explain to the electorate why the development and integration of the European Union should be encouraged and supported. The Taoiseach after the Amsterdam Treaty vote was declared stated that any moves towards European integration would have to be clearly demonstrated in the future. He recognised the dangers in the decrease in the percentage of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. We should be conscious of that as we head towards this referendum.</P>
    <P>The EU has been good for Ireland. On a macro level it has brought peace and stability to Europe. For that reason alone it deserves our wholehearted support. It has also brought unprecedented growth and development and will soon give us a market of more than 550 million people. The levels of employment, growth and prosperity which we now enjoy could not have been achieved if we remained in splendid isolation as promoted by some people at various times over the years. We have received substantial structural and cohesion funds which have transformed our infrastructure. Education and training programmes have been supported for many years by the European Union. Improvements in environment legislation, equal rights for men and women, increased consumer protection and social legislation would not have been achieved so quickly were it not for the pressure which membership of the EU placed on us.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, reviews EU legislation every month. We receive reports from consultants we have employed on all the directions, regulations and statutory instruments which are under consideration in Europe. None of these directives, regulations and statutory instruments would ever see the light of day were they left to Departments in the absence of the EU. We can see from that, the advances that have been made arising from our membership of the Union.</P>
    <P>I reject outright the begging bowl mentality which some in this country subscribe to when it comes to the European Union. The EU is about far more than pounds and pence for Irish citizens. We have a great deal to contribute to Europe given our unique and distinctive voice. It would be a tragedy if Ireland decided to reject the Nice Treaty at the very time when structural and cohesion funds are being phased out. Such a rejection would send the wrong signals to our European partners. I have great confidence in our young people in regard to the forthcoming referendum. Young people tend to be more idealistic and ideological. They, more than any other group will see the benefits of increased European expansion and integration. I suggest to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that their participation should be encouraged in every way possible and particularly in setting the polling date. The Nice Treaty is about institutional reform to bring about the admission of a large number of new member states from central and eastern Europe. We are morally bound to facilitate their accession now that many of them <Col N="167" /> have obtained independence after years of bitter struggle. I cannot believe that Ireland would turn its back on these countries at this time of development as democratic states. That we would pull away the ladder now that we have reached the dizzy heights of economic prosperity is unimaginable. A rejection of the Nice Treaty by Ireland would be a diplomatic, political and economic nightmare from this point of view alone. Those advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote will have to justify why they are turning their backs on our fellow Europeans in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The official reprimand by the European Commission and the Council of Finance Ministers in relation to our budgetary strategy was not helpful given the approaching referendum. Some might be tempted to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; because of this development. As responsible leaders of society we must resist this temptation. The treaty makes provision for qualified majority voting in up to 30 additional areas. I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for their success in exempting taxation from this. This was a diplomatic triumph. Proposals in relation to the Commission, the Court of Justice, weighting of votes, rules on enhanced co-operation etc. will involve some pain. Nevertheless such compromises are necessary for the overall good. We should have an informed debate. We do not want spurious arguments or red herrings.</P>
    <P>Irish neutrality is not under threat by this treaty and this must be explained clearly to the electorate. The Green Party members happily take their seats in the European Parliament and then systematically try to dismantle the whole European project or at least curtail its advancement. I wonder how long they can continue to hold this untenable position. I appeal to the referendum commission to be imaginative in its proposals to provide information on this treaty. There should not be any jargon just simple language and imaginative advertising, television, radio and press. I have no doubt that if it promotes that, the people will respond and the referendum will be passed.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to get this opportunity to speak on the future of the European Union and its potential membership, on how it will do its business and impact on the lives of many millions of people. These people are opposites in many respects but all of them respect human rights and the dignity of mankind, and want to live in democracies that are free from fear oppression and terror. The principles behind the Treaty of Rome are still relevant today. Steering a ship of 20 to 27 member states with very different cultures is a more demanding task than was <Col N="168" /> guiding the future of the six countries which formed the basis of the European Union. The founding fathers had it right. The whole idea was to ensure that we had a peaceful Europe. It worked and there have been very calm waters for the participants for over 30 years. Achieving peace through prosperity is one of the fundamental benefits the EU bestows on its members. That is why there is a huge dawn of hope for the countries in eastern Europe who wish to join the EU, as well as huge responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I remember canvassing with Macra na Feirme in 1971 and 1972 to ensure a yes vote. At that time it was easier to get people to vote, with a yes vote of 90%. We have challenged and overcome a huge inferiority complex. Our politicians, diplomatic corps and Civil Service have shown the world that we are second to nobody. I have seen them in action in Brussels, Strasbourg and every city in the Union through the years, and we have come light years from where we started.</P>
      <P>Of course, I fully appreciate there will be huge changes in how we do our business. For whatever reason the current Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament have not got their message across to citizens in the different member states. Every time we have a referendum the yes vote diminishes, and there is no reason to believe that will change this time. Anthony Coughlan is again leading the no brigade. He played a big role in 1971 and now he is at it again. He and his group only offer negative thinking. I have some serious problems with the concept of the EU, but overall it is better to expand the Union in line with the values we understand to be correct so we can ensure proper democracies and judicial structures in applicant countries. Those groups opposed to the EU forget that not every country is allowed join the Union as there are very strict standards and guidelines laid down before accession can take place. We know about this as we were years trying to make the grade, as were the British. It is against that background that the countries aspiring to entry, such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and Hungary, face a huge challenge and responsibility. A sea change will be necessary in many of the countries and we are glad that because the prize is so great they are bringing that about. The cultures in these countries may be very different from ours in many ways, but we share a huge common ground. Many of these countries are better known to young people because of soccer, a phenomenon of the past five or ten years, and they have no problem in accepting and dealing with these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people forget that after all the years of European membership the Italians are more Italian today than they were 30 years ago and that the Irish are more Irish then ever. All we have to look at is the strength of our Irish games and of the GAA, which has never been more popular. I heard a man saying on a public platform in Ballinasloe in 1971 that Irish dancing, music and hurling would be lost forever, but they have never <Col N="169" /> been stronger. This diversity of culture is very important. Outside economics we have something to give to the EU and it certainly has much to give to us. Integration is possible while still maintaining an individuality, and people must be reassured about this.</P>
    <P>There are issues I would not like to see resulting from integration. For example, I would not like a diktat from the EU that we introduce limited abortion here. This issue is important to each individual country. I agree with the comments of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on taxation. I do not like the idea of small countries not having a Commissioner. I am aware of the weighting system and qualified majorities, but I have huge problems in this regard. At the end of the day there is a difference between large and small countries and there is no doubt that in various negotiations &ndash; I am most familiar with those in the area of agriculture &ndash; most of the time larger countries have a bigger say than smaller countries. That is why I genuinely believe it is important that all the small countries have a Commissioner. What will happen when we have a Union of 27 members is another story.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter is the potential market of 500 million people, which suits an exporting nation such as Ireland. We have the best young salesmen and women to be found and the best techniques. We can see what has been done in the IT sector and in the arts, for example, where we are at the top of the pile.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that we go about our business in the next couple of months in such a way that we convince enough people to vote. The issue is not people voting no, but apathy which will result in people not voting, which is the worst result. Therefore, I hope the referendum will be held on a day which is most suitable, including for young people, and that the campaign is sincere and informative so that many people will want to vote yes, which is the right thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time. Membership of the EU has been good for Ireland, including from an economic, environmental, social justice, agricultural and educational perspective. In education for example, which is one of the driving forces behind our economy, most of the funding for the institutes of technology, both in terms of student fees and development, comes from Europe. This also applies to universities, with most research in recent years being driven by Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot under estimate what European investment has meant to this country. Neither should we forget the importance of American investment in recent years. We seem to have given the message to Brussels that now we are secure and up to the pace of the rest of Europe. This is not the case. I come from a rural constituency on the periphery of Ireland and I know there are growth infrastructural deficits in many parts of this country. However, the perception in <Col N="170" /> Europe is that we are a first world country with a first world economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have an antiquated railway system. People are horrified when they travel on the trains that are provided. The British-Irish Parliamentary Body met recently in Killarney. The MPs who travelled from Dublin by train were horrified at the condition of the railway service between Dublin and Killarney. They travelled to a beautiful modern hotel in Killarney on a train with antiquated carriages which were 30 years out of date. We have lost the run of ourselves. We have been a bit over-boastful of our current riches. We are ostentatious in our wealth and the impression both in Europe and in America is that we are now well-off and we do not need any more hand-outs. We are not totally self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton that we have become much more confident as a nation since we joined Europe. It took the Europeans to recognise our unique culture and music. Europeans of all nationalities appreciate our music and they come in great numbers to the annual Fleadh Ceoil. Enlargement will bring us into contact with other nations such as Poland and the Czech Republic, who also have a great love of music. There will be a great mix of cultures in a new enlarged Europe. This point should be emphasised to those who are against enlargement and who regard themselves as the custodians of Irish culture. I am thinking of the likes of Sinn Féin. I do not see how Sinn Féin can justify its opposition to enlargement. Our role in culture and the arts can only be enhanced in the future through enlargement.</P>
    <P>Europeans have made us aware of how valuable and precious is our environment. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government spoke about the American President's attitude to global warming. He should remember that we have failed to put in place a number of very important EU directives on environment protection. We now find ourselves in the European Court as a result. Ireland was summoned to the European Court to answer a case on the Habitats Directive. We do not have a good record on the care of our environment. We have to take more action on emissions and protection of areas of special significance. It is good that because of European membership we now have designated natural heritage areas. If we were not in Europe I doubt if this protection would have been afforded to our environment.</P>
    <P>Euro scepticism has emanated not only from the usual quarters, but statements were made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands while in America. That is always a good place to talk about green issues. The late Brian Lenihan went to the United States in an effort to kill the Anglo-Irish Agreement. There are great audiences in America for anything that seems to be green.</P>
    <P>The Minister Deputy de Valera's speech was widely reported in Europe. She is a very prominent Minister with a very prominent name and <Col N="171" /> her statement was noted in Europe. We then had the whole débacle of the Minister for Finance's disagreement with the European Commission. He could have explained the position to his European counterparts but his manner displayed arrogance. It gave the impression that the Irish were rich now and did not need the European Union any more. However, we might need European help again. The American economy could shrink and our economy has been driven by American and European investment. If the Americans decided to consolidate their operations back home, then we could be going to Europe for help.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the referendum should not be taken for granted. The traditional opponents of greater integration are far better organised than the last time. They have joined forces and will have a stronger campaign for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote than before. There will be support for that view in some sections of the media.  There are statistics to show popular support for the EU in the past decade. Support for the European Union has fallen from 82% in the 1991 referendum, to 69.5% in the Single European Act referendum, to 68.7% in the Maastricht referendum, down to 60.4% in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum. The turn-out of voters has fallen from 70.9% in 1991, to 56.2% in 1998. I remind the Government that all of us who support the Nice Treaty must go out and campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. We do not need ambiguous statements from Government Ministers which confuse people. The statements issued by Deputy de Valera and others will be thrown back at us when we are canvassing. We must make a clear commitment and statement to the people who have been good to us that we totally support enlargement. There are great opportunities for Ireland in an enlarged Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issues which face us as a country, both in Europe as it is presently constituted, and in an enlarged Europe.  </P>
      <P>In this debate on the Nice Treaty we should remember that all politics is local. While the House debates the issues and while the language in the documents we read is all very European, as political leaders we will have to debate this issue with the public. We must give the public a clear understanding of what is happening in Europe, and how Nice will affect Ireland and it's position in Europe. In spite of most political leaders in Ireland being pro-Nice, we must do more to use this debate to increase public support for Europe.</P>
      <P>Referenda over the past 28 years have seen fewer people supporting a pro-European position on each successive occasion. It is vital that we relate this debate to the electorate in a way that they understand, and point out initiatives taken by Europe that have helped this country, and helped us to play our part in the global markets in which Ireland is now involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> Looking back on the campaign to join the EEC, and then moving to the European Community and from there to the European Union, we see each time a very different Ireland. I recall Ireland during the debate on accession to the EEC. While enjoying the fruits of EU membership in recent years it is easy to forget that we came from a very low base.</P>
    <P>I am glad the various documents associated with Nice, and the synopsis of the White Paper, will be delivered to every home. I hope that a clear picture will be given of the tangible effects of EU membership on the lives of Irish people. We should ensure that the website dealing with the treaty is updated, considering the technological advances and the increasing use of the internet, particularly among schools and community associations. The most recent information regarding Nice should be available on the internet.</P>
    <P>Explaining enlargement to the public is a challenge to the political parties. People will always relate to the benefits received in the past from Europe or what we will receive. This is not necessarily a begging bowl mentality. People always look at the positive side. We need to explain the positive side of enlargement with the electorate. We also need to discuss the negatives of enlargement which exist and have serious implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I return to what Deputy Deenihan said about various Ministers comments on the development of Europe. I am pro-European. I support the Nice Treaty and I speak in favour of this Bill. However, I uphold the right to challenge any policies debated within the EU, because they will affect this and the next generation. I have an input to make and any politician should not be afraid of making a statement on European affairs. There is the politics of keeping everyone on side. There is also the politics of debate which will move Europe forward in a fashion desired by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>On the economic side, we can point to road infrastructure and services which have benefited enormously &ndash; to the tune of 2% of GNP in the 1990s. About us we can see the economic success achieved. Europe has contributed in a positive and tangible way to the lives of Irish people. In education and training enormous progress has been made. The various programmes bring on board people who have often been excluded in terms of social justice. There are new opportunities and this is due to the funding made available by Europe.</P>
    <P>We have also seen advances in the environment. That is an area which not only brings improvements throughout the economy but brings huge challenges. The current issue of waste management and the fact that Ireland is not in line with current EU directives is an example. That is another area where the public need to understand the current debate.</P>
    <P>The EU to some people is a matter for politicians and not for the public. They should understand that the public is Europe. The challenges of <Col N="173" /> waste management and EU directives should be explained to the public in a clearer way. It should be explained how they can take cases against their local authority or the Government regarding the satisfaction of EU directives. We should ensure that the justice system is made easy to follow in terms of that interaction with the public. There should not be justice by exclusion. Justice should not be so expensive that local communities feel isolated and deprived of access on EU matters. We need the full participation of the people so that they understand their rights within Europe and are not miles away from the centre of events, or excluded from the courts of justice and other EU mechanisms. With such assistance they will begin to participate and perhaps learn to challenge particular directives.</P>
    <P>I see no wrong in the situation in which the Minister for Finance found himself recently regarding the European Commission. We must stand on our own. Ireland has it's own identity, integrity and culture. Diverse cultures make up Europe and this makes it different and politically challenging. We have the right to defend our country and to defend our economic policy while at the same time allowing the space to debate, and participate fully in European affairs. There is nothing wrong with that. The day that debate is not possible is the day Europe has failed us. There is room for that debate and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the 28 years from 1973, £22 billion in agricultural supports and £2 billion in agri-structural funds was received by Ireland. We have to look at that funding beside the advances in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government and the people to develop the agriculture sector in Ireland and Europe in a way which ensures Irish agriculture is green and produces a quality product. That is not the case currently.</P>
    <P>We speak about the huge European market of 500 million people. Nevertheless, if one visits a French or Spanish supermarket, one finds it difficult to find an Irish product well labelled on the meat counter. In French supermarkets one finds an abundance of French products aggressively marketed. We have not achieved the same degree of market penetration. We must identify Ireland as the source of a quality product of a standard next to none in Europe and market that product in the European and global market. It is up to the Government, using the billions of pounds we have received from Europe, to ensure this, but it is not being done. Within Europe we have not achieved a level of market penetration where we can say that the Irish product is accepted by consumers and we are happy with its position in the market.</P>
    <P>I question the direction we are taking with regard to agriculture, product marketing and looking after rural Ireland. Through the Leader programme we have played our part in developing rural Ireland. European money has been given to projects in rural Ireland which would not have been possible without EU fund<Col N="174" /> ing. The positive results of this spending can be seen throughout the country. I want to see that spending continue within the framework of protecting rural Ireland and our farming methods rather than adopting methods of intensification to the point where our product is the same as that of every other country. We must have something which makes us different from the rest. We should spend money on creating a quality niche market. It is up to us and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to access this market.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that young farmers are not encouraged to follow their parents into agriculture. I see a huge drop in the number of young farmers, something which should concern us. The foot and mouth crisis has shown that where agriculture is affected, the whole economy is affected in turn. We must continue to monitor the problem.</P>
    <P>We have created a positive profile within Europe of the Irish entrepreneur who is willing to take a risk and become involved in the development of information technology in the global market. People are confident of our product in that area. We have become serious exporters of software and related products. In an enlarged Europe, technology is one of the areas which will be targeted because of the availability of cheap labour. Technology products can be produced more cheaply elsewhere and because we are an island off the coast of Europe, other countries will be able to access the European market more cheaply. Technology was the first industry to suffer in the current slowing down of the United States economy. This should be a matter of concern for the Irish economy. The development of the IT industry has been very intense in the past five years with investment from both America and Europe. Successive wage agreements are affecting our costs and we can expect to see more competition from an enlarged Europe. While we can currently access 370 million people, when European enlargement is completed the European market will consist of 550 million people.</P>
    <P>As we become more involved in an enlarged Europe the power of the Oireachtas will decline. More and more activity in Ireland will be dictated by European finance. The effect will be seen throughout the chain of our democratic structure. Local government will also be affected. Most local funding is dictated by Europe, bypasses this House and is almost spent before it gets to local authority level. The region has acquired a new importance. Local democracy should be given greater importance. The spending of European money should be built from the bottom up. It should not be dictated at European level through the Oireachtas to local authorities. There is a role to be played at community level. The value of our democracy is based on the full participation of local communities and local authorities throughout the country using the powers they have enjoyed for the past 100 years. As far as possible, <Col N="175" /> we should insist that European funding for Ireland comes through the Oireachtas to local authorities and that Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities are made responsible for the spending of that money and understand how it is being spent in their local areas. This would achieve a direct connection between the people who are being asked to vote for the Nice Treaty and the centre of European power. This is essential to our democracy.</P>
    <P>Ireland has shown how a small country can make an enormous contribution to Europe. It has been acknowledged that Irish representatives in Europe, from every political party, have made an important contribution to the development of Europe. They do not merely represent Irish interests. They understand the European dimension of the work of the European Parliament. As long as we continue to make this contribution, we can maintain our role within an enlarged Europe.</P>
    <P>As well as the benefits of European membership, there are huge challenges. We must acknowledge these challenges and be prepared for them.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Artificial Insemination Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked to raise this issue on the Adjournment because things are becoming urgent in livestock breeding and on dairy and suckler farms in particular. I have made a submission to the Minister and have asked him to give it to the expert committee in place in his Department so that consideration can be given to resuming AI services at the earliest possible opportunity. It is something which has so far been advised against if not banned outright by the Minister and his Department for reasons which I fully understand and support. Although I am at one with the Minister in counselling caution in what we do in this area, we need to have a well-informed view on what we can do to permit the resumption of normal activities on farms to the extent that that is possible without running unnecessary risks. I proposed to the Minister that we should allow the resumption of AI services under controlled conditions by registered operators. My submission proposed that operators should have adequate disinfection equipment to be used when arriving at and leaving a farm. I proposed also that each farm visit be logged so that we can keep track of the movements. I proposed that each farmer using the service would be required to keep on farm a stock of single use protective clothing for the use of operators to be donned when the operator arrives and left on the farm when the operator leaves so that it can be disposed of in a proper way with the disposable equipment that the <Col N="176" /> operator has used on visits to farms. In that way any risks involved from the kind of indirect contact between farms that would be in question here would be reduced.</P>
      <P>The position has become urgent. We are well into the normal breeding season when farmers are beginning to think of getting their cows in calf and if operations are not resumed at this stage this could have an impact on the level of production for the coming year in the new milk season and in the suckler cow sector. I am encouraged in the proposal I have made by a submission from the AI Managers Association of Ireland. They have proposed a rigid system of controls, one of which is that farmers requesting the service would delay the call until it is absolutely necessary and that they have adequate disinfection procedures in place. They have proposed also that each inseminator would operate only in a defined geographical area to ensure we can keep track of the movements involved. They proposed that in addition to the normal disinfection procedures each inseminator would have with him portable disfection procedures to be used before and after each visit. They have proposed also that visits would not be made to farms where disinfection procedures on the farm of personnel and vehicles are not adequate. They have proposed that on each farm requesting a visit disposable anti-infection clothing would be available and that there would be an increased supply of approved disinfectant.</P>
      <P>The fear is, and this has been expressed to me and I am sure to the Minister also by many farmers, that if action is not taken now to resume these services under controlled conditions, these services will be provided and taken under uncontrolled conditions, perhaps by the DIY operators in the sector and by those operating in the black economy. That would be an undesirable development. I am sure the Minister will agree that if these services are to take place it is best that they should take place under agreed strict control conditions.</P>
      <P>It has been announced this evening that it is the Minister's intention that these services should resume as from Easter Monday onwards. I do not know whether that is accurate but I hope it is. If we provide for the resumption of these services under properly controlled conditions we can keep the risk to the minimum level with which we can feel comfortable. I have asked that the expert committee carry out a risk assessment in a hard-headed way. I recommend to the Minister, and he may have done so already and in which case I congratulate and support him and ask for details, that this be carried out under strictly controlled conditions. If that is done and if we can take sensible controlled and well-judged measures to allow normal operations to resume, to the extent that that is possible under conditions with which we can feel comfortable, the Minister will find a ready response within the dairy industry generrally and the suckler industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this matter. He has raised this and a number of other issues which are pertinent, important and economically essential for the agriculture industry. The point he has made is a valid one, it is, that the expert group under Professor Michael Monaghan should do a risk assessment and an economic evaluation on certain activities. If there is minimisation of the risk to little or no risk, matters such as artificial insemination are worth going into in some detail. What is at stake is the dairy industry, the milk industry and the milk quota. If cows and heifers are put in calf now they will calve about the middle of January but if it goes later it will be mid-February before they calve and this would cause a great deal of hardship and negative consequences for the industry.</P>
      <P>This week brought good news with the confirmation that the suspect case in Piedmont in County Louth was negative and that the various other tests in Bunclody, Carlow and other parts of the country were negative also. That meant we were able to look more positively at various issues. We have arranged for the AI managers or licensees to meet the Department's veterinary people tomorrow. Professor Michael Monaghan, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD, is evaluating on an on-going basis various control measures and assessing risks. There are still risks because of the overhang of the British problem. There are now 15 cases of disease in the Netherlands. This is not a time nor will it be for the next couple of weeks for becoming complacent.</P>
      <P>As regards the AI service we knew from the outset that while it was an important service to farmers it was also in this context one of the highest risk activities because operatives were handling susceptible animals and going on to another farm. Given that it was one of the highest risk areas we talked with the licensees who willingly ceased operations as did many of the other agricultural industry activities. Also voluntary organisations ceased to operate. We also asked the DIY AI personnel to do likewise. I know for certain that licensees have ceased operations, maybe some DIY people have been operating surreptitiously and, if so, they should not.</P>
      <P>As with many other necessary measures taken, the AI organisations and their employees and contractors as well as the farmers who would have availed of their services have suffered hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the AI organisations accepted that the measure was necessary to protect the animal health status of the national herd in exceptional circumstances. However, despite the recent good news on the subject to which I referred, I reiterate that the situation concerning foot and mouth disease remains very serious. The risks and potentially disastrous consequences involved in relaxing restrictions in key areas too soon cannot be over stated. The easing of the restriction on the Al service is under active consideration. I <Col N="178" /> announced earlier today that, subject to agreement on protocols, of which Deputy Dukes has a copy, Al services can resume during the week commencing 16 April. We also envisage training lasting perhaps one day as this is a high risk area. Those involved are responsible and would carry out the protocols in accordance with the conditions set out. Senior officials of my Department are meeting AI field service licensees tomorrow to discuss the protocol and associated issues and to finalise the details involved. On the basis of the outcome of those discussions, and taking into account the advice of the Expert Committee on Foot and Mouth Restrictions, I expect to shortly announce the details requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank all those involved in the AI services who have co-operated so wholeheartedly with the requests and requirements of my Department on this issue. I realise and understand the very difficult position the current situation has placed them in. They have been patient and I will not hold up the resumption of the service, under a tightly controlled regime, for any longer than is necessary. I also thank Professor Monaghan and the members of the expert group for their excellent and dedicated work on this important subject. I am satisfied that the net benefit from caution in this case will be long-term gain and the protection of our most valuable national asset.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Loss of Blood Samples.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister and the Government to immediately hold a public inquiry into the loss of blood and other samples which belonged to the Geoghegan family from Askeaton, County Limerick. The report of the internal inquiry group appointed by the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board in November 2000 is flawed and the family deserves and demands an independent investigation into what can only be described as the limited information given to its members through the report.</P>
      <P>The family has had concerns about its health for several years. Its members are concerned about environmental pollution or toxicity in the area. Such concern has existed for many years and in 1996 the Environmental Protection Agency initiated a full investigation into the problems. We still await a final report from the agency. As a result of the family's illnesses, many blood, urine and other samples were provided by its members. In April 1999 they were informed by the health board that a number of these samples had been lost. The family believed these samples were in the safe keeping of the health board, either in storage or at some stage of testing for various environmental toxins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family has been misled and has stated that it is concerned that some conspiracy is at work. The only way to resolve this issue for the Geoghegan family is to instigate an independent public inquiry. The health board did not store or test various samples and specimens. Why did this not <Col N="179" /> happen? Why did the pathologist in administrative charge in the laboratory fail to deliver certain services at the request of the director of public health? Why are there no records which has made it impossible to verify whether all family samples were properly stored in the first place? I am convinced that the samples were not properly stored.</P>
    <P>Despite assurances to the family why were all of the samples not stored? Why was no system put in place by the laboratory to ensure that this happened? What happened to the samples, including blood, hair and swabs, collected by the family and its general practitioner which were handed to the pathologist in administrative charge in the Mid-Western Health Board in Limerick by the area medical officer on behalf of the department of public health? What happened to the samples taken from a family member by an accident and emergency department staff member? Why did a blood sample supplied to be tested for toxins undergo a toxicology test?</P>
    <P>The family deserves and demands a public inquiry to establish these issues and to clarify what blood and other samples went missing, to compile an inventory of blood taken and to establish when these samples went missing. The family deserves an independent examination of the statement by the pathologist in his letter of 13 April 1999 which was the only response sent to the director of public health over a two-year period. In this letter the pathologist stated that samples that were originally dispatched for analysis appeared to have gone astray in the post. He also stated that he originally divided the samples before despatch but that, unfortunately, during the move from the old laboratory to a new laboratory, they were discarded along with some other samples and, therefore, were no longer available for testing. The samples sent by post and those retained were lost. The pathologist said he made this statement because he could not think of any other explanation.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor the Geoghegan family have any confidence in such a service. The issues are too serious for an internal Mid-Western Health Board inquiry. A public inquiry must be set up by the Minister. When will the family receive the promised apology, in person or otherwise, from the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board? From as early as April 1997, the family was entitled to believe the board was looking after its health concerns, including making arrangements to store and test samples and specimens. When the family supplied a list of chemicals and asked that its samples be tested for these chemicals, it was led to believe that this would happen. For more than one year the family regularly inquired as to the progress in this regard and was reassured that samples were being stored, tested and sent to other laboratories. The family was also told that the results of some tests had been received while others were awaited. The family was eventually told that everything had <Col N="180" /> been lost. In short, the family was misled and feels let down.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the group established that the department of public health was in regular contact with the family and advised them on this matter. The report states that the department was unwittingly relaying misleading information to the family. It is easy to understand how the family could conclude that there was a conspiracy, that poisons or toxins had been detected in the samples and that the board and others were conspiring to keep this information from them. The Minister should ensure that this issue is concluded by way of a public inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the report of the internal inquiry group set up by the Mid-Western Health Board is that, since 1995, there have been ongoing investigations in the Askeaton area of County Limerick regarding concerns of a possible link between environmental factors and human and animal health problems reported in the area. A multi-agency investigation was carried out, co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency, and involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Teagasc and the Mid-Western Health Board. The human health investigations involved, among other things, the taking of numerous blood and other samples from persons in the area including the family referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The family, who live and farm in the Askeaton area, has had concerns over its health for some time and believed that its members were being adversely affected by some form of environmental pollution or toxic fallout from heavy industry in the area. The family was given to understand by the Mid-Western Health Board that arrangements were made by the board to store and test samples taken from them. The family sought information from the health board in regard to the samples but was unable to obtain satisfactory information regarding storage and testing. The health board advised the family in April 1999 that some samples had been lost. The family was deeply concerned over this as it believed all along that the samples were being stored and tested for toxins and expressed the view that some form of conspiracy might be involved. Concerns were subsequently raised at a health board meeting in 2000 and the chief executive officer of the health board set up an internal inquiry into the reported loss of the samples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the inquiry group published recently made a number of recommendations. These include the need for improvements in the receipt, tracking, testing and storage of samples at the pathology laboratory in Limerick regional hospital. The inquiry group also recommended that the health board, in consultation with the family and its doctor, should provide the services of a consultant physician to advise the family and that expert advice be sought in the field of <Col N="181" /> environmental toxicology as to the most appropriate tests to be carried out on the available specimens. The report criticised record keeping in the laboratory and interaction between the laboratory and the board's department of public health.</P>
    <P>The inquiry group concluded that there was no conspiracy involved. I am advised that the Mid-Western Health Board has initiated an action plan to facilitate the process of improving standards and systems at the laboratory and that all the other recommendations made in the report in this area will be implemented.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recommendation on providing expert advice and services to the family concerned, I am advised that the health board will be arranging for this following completion of consultations with the family which have commenced. A combination of errors, both human and of the systems involved, contributed to the difficulties that arose in trying to deal with what was a very unusual set of circumstances. The recommendations of the inquiry group provide a positive basis for the health board to act on and when fully implemented should lead to improvements in the services that can be provided to the public in this type of environmental health investigation. Clearly, the experience has been a learning process for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. I would like to outline the situation in regard to the ambulance service from Killarney Community Hospital. The service from the hospital serves Killarney and a huge surrounding area, including Rathmore, Barraduff, Carrow and up to Ballydesmond in County Cork. This service is too restrictive. On three days per week, the full service available is between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. On two days per week, the full service available is between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. On weekends, the full service is only available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Outside these hours, there is an on-call service which is not satisfactory. In fact, it is a disgrace for a town the size of Killarney and the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>The staff on the ambulance have been negotiating an improved cover for the past 18 months. They have gone through all the normal channels but, unfortunately, they have not been successful. This is not their fault but that of the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the ambulance service, according to the Southern Health Board, &ldquo;is to develop our ambulance service so that our patients receive an efficient service, irrespective of where they are located.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, the Minister, who is from the Southern Health Board area, is not here tonight but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will deliver the message. <Col N="182" /> Would the Minister agree that the present situation is far removed from the objective outlined by the Southern Health Board? It is unbelievable in this day and age that if somebody becomes very ill during the night or if there is an accident, the ambulance is not immediately available but must wait to call the staff from their homes. They have then to travel to Killarney Community Hospital, which is the ambulance centre, pick up the ambulance and then proceed to the location of the ill person or the accident. The location could be 25 miles away from the Killarney Community Hospital and the journey could take anything up to 20 minutes to 25 minutes. That amount of time, in certain cases, is vital.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has admitted that Killarney is one of the busiest stations in its area. Some 18 months ago it stated that it would reduce the on-call service but it literally had to be dragged to this position by both the Labour Court and the unions. Improvements were to have been made by June 2000 but, unfortunately, nothing has been done to date. This is a despicable way to treat the people of Killarney and the surrounding areas and the staff who are doing a tremendous job under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, will have a prepared speech but I want the answers to two questions. What happened to the funding provided in 2000 for the improvement of emergency cover and the reduction of on-call cover? Money was provided but nothing was done. When will Killarney enter the modern age and be provided with a full 24 hour ambulance service? I am sure everybody in this House is aware that Killarney town and the surrounding area swells with many thousands of visitors during the summer months. I am sure visitors to the most scenic and beautiful town in this country would be appalled if they realised that a town such as ours had such an inadequate service and who would blame them in this day and age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising this issue. I will bring the questions she asked to the attention of the Minister on whose behalf I am replying. Significant developments have taken place and will continue to take place to enhance this service which is very important to the whole Killarney area. Before doing so, however, I would like, as the Minister, Deputy Martin, did in the course of a similar debate on the ambulance service last week, to pay tribute to all of those in the ambulance service who work so hard to provide life-saving care in circumstances which can very often be difficult and unpleasant.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is as set out in a number of policy documents, most notably the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service, which was published in 1993 and &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group, which contained wide-ranging recommendations, set out an <Col N="183" /> ambitious programme of developments which were needed to align standards in emergency medical care in Ireland with best international practice in this area of medical care. The report, <i>inter alia</i>, addressed the issue of the level of cover currently being provided by ambulance crews and made the recommendations on how improvements might be made.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made by the Southern Health Board on the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review group. This progress has been facilitated by special development funding from the Department of Health and Children to the board of in excess of £3 million in recent years. Much of this investment funding has been directed by the board towards improvements, on a phased basis, in the level of duty hours cover in all of the board's ambulance stations. The board's service plans continue to address the issue of increasing the level of in-station duty hours cover with a subsequent reduction of on-call cover.</P>
    <P>The board's five year development plan for its ambulance service, 1997-2002, identifies the need to improve the level of emergency ambulance cover in a number of areas. I am pleased to report that the board has now fully implemented the objective of all emergency ambulances being crewed by professionally qualified emergency medical technicians and the full integration of part-time temporary ambulance nursing posts into the service. The Killarney station was the first of the 16 stations to have this improvement implemented in 1998.</P>
    <P>In 2000 the board embarked on a phased plan to further extend the on-duty cover in the 16 stations outside the Cork and Tralee area and again Killarney was prioritised for this development to take place this year with the addition of an ambulance and an extra crew. The additional resources to effect this improvement on the service in Killarney will enable the board to extend the level of an in-station duty cover to 1 a.m. each day. The other stations identified are Mallow and Middleton.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are at an advanced stage between the board and the staff side to agree the early implementation of the new roster in Killarney and this has involved a joint union-management committee being formed. Ongoing discussions are taking place with the staff members in Killarney with a view to implementing the necessary improvements to the service there and in addressing the concerns of the staff with the issue of reducing the level of on-call cover and ensuring that a period of on-call duty at night is not followed by the duty the next day.</P>
    <P>The board is fully satisfied that the new rostering arrangements currently being discussed will ensure the service in the Killarney area will be improved in the most effective way, directing the additional resources to where they are most needed, to serve the community of Killarney.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> The reduction of on-call cover and the increase of duty cover to 24 hours is but one of the many aspects of the ambulance service that requires development. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board last year established a strategic review group to review the implementation of the recommendations of the 1993 report in the board's area and, in particular, to address the issue of the appropriate level of ambulance stations and hours of cover in those stations with the costed implementation plan for all the board's area. This strategic review will include a costing analysis for 24-hour cover in all the board's ambulance stations. I am informed by the board that this strategic review will be completed before the end of this year and we look forward to its outcome.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Local Drugs Task Forces.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and also the Minister for State for coming in to the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy review is likely to be published in the next few weeks outlining future plans and investment in the fight against drug use and addiction in the capital and throughout the country. Cork was the only area outside Dublin included in the original national drugs strategy and there have been many positive results.</P>
      <P>An expansion of the current strategy and local drugs task forces is required. I am glad that this is happening in Cork city centre with new projects on both the north side and south side being incorporated in the Minister of State's new plans. He visited Cork recently to launch the Cork local drugs task force action plan, phase 1, which allocates more than £700,000 to fund 16 projects in the city centre. This is welcome news for which I thank him. However, a serious mistake may be made by not including in the overall strategy a number of areas outside the city centre, satellite towns with large young populations which have serious and growing drugs and drug-related problems.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 of the Cork local drugs task force plan has been announced, but phase 2 is under assessment and will finish in July. Unfortunately, my sources have said that the indications are that phase 2 projects will not be accepted for funding under the national drugs strategy. Phase 2 specifically refers to four projects in areas outside Cork city where evidence suggests that funding community drug or youth initiatives would be beneficial. Three of the proposed projects are in areas in my constituency. I will only have time to refer to two in detail, but all four have similar problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the Carrigaline youth initiative. The project aims to divert young people in the town at risk of or currently abusing drugs and-or alcohol to involve them in a needs-based developmental youth work programme. Evidence of need <Col N="185" /> for such a programme in this area is clear. The Garda juvenile liaison office figures for Carrigaline stand at 50 cases for 2000. There is no paid youth work provision in the town. It continues to grow rapidly and its current population is approximately 16,000. A total of 240 houses per year are built in the area. At least one third of the population are young and there is a growing drugs problem in the town. I live only five minutes from Carrigaline. I have a 16 year old brother and I am well aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Ballincollig youth initiative is the second project. The initiative aims to develop a locally-based project which will employ a community drugs worker to work with young people at risk in the area. Ballincollig has one of the most rapidly growing populations in Ireland. More than 50% of the population comprises young people and its age profile is similar to Ballymun and Knocknaheeny. Two recent studies have recorded that 75% to 78% of 12 to 18 year olds in the town have taken their first alcoholic drink and 45% to 50% take a drink regularly. These claims mean that more than 1,000 young people from the town are drinking regularly. A total of 22% of young people said that they had taken drugs and 6% take them regularly.</P>
    <P>Figures break down to show that 500 schoolchildren are engaged in illegal drug activity. I do not wish to be overly dramatic in regard to the problem in Ballincollig, but it does exist. Garda juvenile liaison office figures show approximately 50 cases there last year. There has been an increase in the number of complaints received by local gardaí about young people aged 14 years and upwards who are involved in using and dealing in drugs. Successful prosecutions and drug seizures have taken place in the area and Stop Drugs Now, a local drug counselling group which is open 24 hours a day, has indicated that a substantial number of the complaints it receives come from the Ballincollig area.</P>
    <P>The other projects relate to Douglas west in my constituency and Glanmire. The Minister of State is well aware of the difference between the drugs problem in Cork and the capital. Recreational drugs are primarily abused in Cork, but they still present a serious problem. I emphasise that the growth areas of population in Cork are in the satellite towns to which I referred. Many young people and young families are moving to these towns. It is a recipe for disaster if we do not get stuck into these areas in terms of drug treatment. I ask the Minister of State to use his influence to ensure these areas are covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall aim of the Government's drugs strategy is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. Since 1997 local drugs task forces have also been established in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. As the Deputy will be aware, the task forces bring together key State <Col N="186" /> agencies to work with the local community and voluntary groups to develop appropriate responses to the local drugs problem.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Government allocated £10 million to support the implementation of measures contained in the action plans prepared by the task forces. More than 200 projects were allocated funding to deliver a range of interventions and more than 120 of these projects have been mainstreamed. The task forces are updating their plans for the next three years and the Government has provided £15 million per annum for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In this context, the new local drugs task force action plan for Cork city, which I launched earlier this month, is a comprehensive one, developed by the local drugs task force in partnership with the communities involved and the statutory agencies. The plan is evidence of the continued commitment and drive among the members of the local drugs task force and the community at large in Cork to tackling the complex issue of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>One of the principal strengths of the local drugs task force process has been to bring all the key players involved in this area together with the aim of identifying how best to tackle this complex problem. The Cork task force has been particularly successful in building confidence and trust between the statutory and community sectors. The national drugs strategy would not succeed, as it has, without this commitment to working in partnership.</P>
      <P>While Cork city has been saved from the ravages of heroin misuse, the clear message in the new plan is that there is little room for complacency and the variety of actions recommended for the whole of Cork city underlines the need for early and effective preventive measures. To this end, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, recently approved funding of £787,500 for 16 of the projects contained in the plan. The remaining proposals are being considered by the national drugs strategy team and I expect their recommendations on these in due course. I will raise with it the four different projects to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The new plan is a natural progression on the previous action plan which was allocated more than £560,000 in 1997. Since then more than £1.1 million has been spent implementing the various programmes approved, many of which have been mainstreamed and as such will continue to receive Government funding. I am sure the Deputy will agree that, by any standards, this represents an unprecedented level of investment at community level in the fight against drugs and is strong evidence of the priority which the Government gives to the local drugs task force process. The revised plan continues to focus primarily on the development of preventive strategies, targeted at young people experimenting with drugs or at risk of becoming involved in problematic drug use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force identified some key gaps and deficiencies in its existing strategy and these, in <Col N="187" /> turn, informed the overall objectives of the new plan which are: to provide training for groups and individuals to increase their capacity to respond to drug misuse in their areas; to extend community based drug projects &ndash; on the lines of the models successfully piloted in the first plan &ndash; to other areas of need; to provide education programmes and other supports for at risk young people both inside and outside the school setting, as well as providing support, advice and information to their families; to develop additional rehabilitation programmes and services for those in recovery; to provide interventions for homeless drug users; and to respond to the unsafe use of prescribed drugs.</P>
    <P>When the plan was being developed, the task force requested that its operational area, which initially covered north Cork city, be extended to include the whole of the city and its surrounding areas. The national drugs strategy team recommended, and it was agreed, that the task force area be extended to be co-terminous with the partnership area, as is the case in other task force areas. The Deputy will be aware that the partnership area in Cork covers the whole of the city, but not the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to funding allocated to the local drugs task force, Cork city has also been allocated £2.4 million under the young people's facilities and services fund to support 35 individual pro<Col N="188" /> jects as part of an overall drug prevention strategy aimed at young people who are marginalised and at risk of drug misuse. While specific funding is made available to local drugs task force areas where there is an existing heroin problem or has the potential to exist in the particular areas which they serve, the activities of Departments and State agencies, which have a nationwide application, all contribute to the overall national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the current approach to tackling the drugs problem remains relevant and continues to have an impact, I initiated a comprehensive review of the current drugs strategy in May 2000. The overall objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy and develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them. As part of the review, an extensive public consultation process was undertaken. Eight regional public fora were conducted, including one in Cork. In addition, almost 190 written submissions were received and meetings took place with 34 different interested groups from all sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>The new strategy will provide a policy framework through which all those involved in addressing this complex problem can work for the next number of years. I intend to publish the new strategy in early May.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 59, 96 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed by Deputies about the unsuitable accommodation in which a group of nurses recruited from the Philippines were placed. The case received widespread coverage in the media last week and I want to make it clear that what happened was unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nurses involved were recruited to work for the three area health boards in the eastern region. I have received a report on the outcome of the investigation by the three boards concerned into the circumstances leading to the placement of the nurses in the accommodation in question. The bed and breakfast accommodation in Gardiner Street in which the nurses were originally placed was pre-booked for the St. Patrick's weekend, and it was necessary for the nurses to be moved <Col N="190" /> to alternative accommodation. As soon as the three area health boards were made aware of the situation, they acted immediately to provide the nurses with improved accommodation. The three boards have expressed regret and apologised to the nurses for their unfortunate experience. I have been assured that all future accommodation to be provided by the three boards for nurses coming from abroad will be carefully assessed.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as the Deputies to ensure this unsatisfactory situation does not recur. On my instructions, my Department has written to health service employers reminding them of their responsibilities towards nurses recruited from abroad.</P>
    <P>Nurses coming to this country from the Philippines and other countries are proving a very valuable resource and it is vitally important that they are treated properly. Health service employers have a clear responsibility to look after the welfare of these nurses and to facilitate their integration into our health care system. In fairness to the general body of employers, the practical assistance provided by them has greatly benefited nurses recruited from abroad. All health service employers involved in the recruitment of nurses and other health service professionals from abroad have an obligation to assist them in finding suitable accommodation and help them to settle in here generally. Employers have been requested to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to give effect to this.</P>
    <P>As regards the employment rights of nurses being recruited from abroad, I expect prospective employers, as a matter of good human resource practice, to inform nurses about their various rights and entitlements. The provision of advice on planning laws would, however, be beyond the scope of the information that health service employers could reasonably be expected to impart to applicants for nursing positions.</P>
    <P>A steering committee chaired by the chief nursing officer of my Department, is overseeing a major nursing and midwifery workforce planning study. At its meeting last Tuesday week, that steering committee agreed that guidelines on best practice in the recruitment of nurses from abroad should be prepared. The unfortunate incident that came to light later last week has underlined the need for such guidelines. My Department is pressing ahead with arrangements for the establishment of an expert working group to produce these guidelines as a matter of urgency. As soon as they are ready, these guidelines will be circulated to all health service employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>National policy on the treatment of alcohol <Col N="191" /> abuse, as set out in Planning for the Future, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol-related problems should be on community-based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment. Health boards already provide and continue to develop a range of comprehensive community-based support services appropriate to the needs of persons affected and afflicted by alcohol abuse. These services include family support and community, medical and social services in the management of the problem. Health boards are also considering ways in which services provided by voluntary and-or private facilities might integrate with the health boards' services and a number of the boards have made local arrangements to enable access to specialist in-patient treatment in the small number of cases where the need arises.</P>
      <P>The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol dependence are psychotherapy, counselling, family and marital therapy, either individually or in group settings. Therapy may take place in a residential or a day setting. As alcohol related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community-based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems.</P>

      <P>The administration of the childhood immunisation programme is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards. Since December 1995 general practitioners have been contracted by the health boards to deliver the primary childhood immunisation programme.</P>
      <P>In view of the level of administration of oral polio vaccine, OPV, after its expiry date my Department has already requested health boards to examine systems and procedures currently in place, to identify shortcomings where these exist and to put in place revised systems-procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In addition health boards have been requested to take appropriate measures in respect of all vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information, that is patient name, batch number and expiry date, by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have also been asked to examine how the administration of out-of-date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has <Col N="192" /> also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners who have been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
    <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national immunisation steering committee, which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Medicines Board has been requested by my Department to consider the introduction of peel-off labels for all vaccines which would contain the batch number and the expiry date of the vaccine. This system would minimise recording errors, particularly in relation to batch number and expiry date, and improve the quality of vaccine data recording at both health board and GP level.</P>
    <P>The situation whereby incomplete records are maintained and vaccines are administered after the expiry date is far from acceptable and that is why I along with relevant agencies have taken the range of measures necessary to ensure a comprehensive examination of the administration of the childhood immunisation programme.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the merits of having full testing procedures to best international standards for blood transfusion purposes in Cork; and the steps he proposes to take to achieve this.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9346/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the essential requirement for every patient regardless of location who requires a blood transfusion is that the safety and quality of blood component complies with international standards. I am advised that the donor selection and testing programmes at the Irish Blood Transfusion Service comply with EU and Council of Europe Guidelines, are as comprehensive as any in Europe and conform to existing international standards. Over and above these requirements the IBTS and the transfusion services in Northern Ireland currently rely on the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to conduct PCR testing for Hepatitis C. The availability of this test performed as it is outside the State is an additional safety measure for the benefit of patients throughout the country. These arrangements are evidence that the quality and range of tests actually performed are more important that the location of testing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also convinced that the IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health <Col N="193" /> system in which there are increasing demands on transfusion services to adapt and change. Clinicians are increasingly assessing the use of alternatives to blood transfusion for their patients. A recent transfusion guideline which has been prepared by the National Blood Users Group advises that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusion should be made widely available, and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques, surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss. The chief medical officer of my Department has also recently advised clinicians that the avoidance of unnecessary transfusion of allogeneic blood constitutes the most important approach available in reducing any possible risk patients of infection with variant CJD through blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>The current debate on testing involving the Dublin and Cork centres of the IBTS attempts to portray the organisation as split on geographic lines and seems to visualise Dublin and Cork as separate or competing entities. In my opinion this is clearly not a platform on which to develop a national transfusion service. The governance function of the board in organising and managing its remit must be respected regardless of geography. This is an essential objective if the service is to meet the challenges to which I have already ready referred. In exercise of its governance function, the board of the IBTS, based on a recommendation from its chief executive officer and national medical director, has agreed to establish a three person committee of international experts of standing in the field of blood transfusion to review the decision of the board of July 1999 to consolidate testing at its national headquarters. The membership of the committee will comprise a nominee of the IBTS and of the Southern Health Board and the third person is to be jointly agreed. This is an important development and the testing issue raised by the Deputy can best be addressed in this open and transparent process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department gave approval on 23 February to the IBTS for the immediate establishment of a project team to prepare a design brief for new facilities for the IBTS in Cork. The project team has been established and its first meeting will take place on Friday 6 March.</P>

      <P>My Department is advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that to date 11 candidates have been appointed, have been offered, or are being offered, temporary contracts on foot of the decision to recruit additional consultants in accident and emergency medicine in acute general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> In addition, I understand interviews have been scheduled with a view to the early recruitment of a further ten consultants. The remaining eight posts may need to be readvertised.</P>
    <P>It typically takes more than 12 months to complete recruitment of a consultant on a permanent basis. In the circumstances, and with a view to increasing, as soon as possible, the number of consultants working in accident and emergency departments, it was agreed with Comhairle na nOspidéal that the additional appointments in this key area would initially be made on a temporary basis. It is evident from the progress report that I have presented above, that the initiative has reduced the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of additional consultants. I look forward to continuing progress in this area over the coming months and I am confident that the posts involved can be filled in the current year.</P>

      <P>Stimulant drinks contain three active ingredients, caffeine, glucuronolactone and taurine. In 1999 the European Scientific Committee for Food, SCF, was asked by the European Commission for an opinion on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks. This committee, which carries out risk assessment on foodstuffs in Europe, reached a number of conclusions in its opinion. These were based on an assumed maximum intake level of 0.5 litre of energy drink per day. It concluded that the contribution of energy drinks to overall caffeine intake is not a matter of concern for non-pregnant adults; moderation of caffeine intake, from whatever source, is advisable during pregnancy; substitution of energy drinks for normal beverages by children could lead to increased caffeine levels in this group; this could result in transient behavioural changes such as arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety; the interaction of energy drinks has not been well studied; nor has the interaction of caffeine and taurine with alcohol particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating; the safety-in-use of taurine and glucuronolactone as delivered in energy drinks has not been established; and further studies would be required.</P>
      <P>This opinion makes it clear that the scientific data were not available to answer all questions about the safety of these energy drinks under all circumstances of usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the fact that energy drinks are on sale throughout the country, it is important that their safety is evaluated on a national level. I requested <Col N="196" /> the Food Safety Promotion Board, FSPB, one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, to commission independent, scientific research into the effects of these stimulant energy drinks.</P>
    <P>The FSPB established a committee of scientific experts, called the Stimulant Drinks Committee. Under the chairmanship of Professor Seán Strain, University of Ulster at Coleraine, this committee has conducted an initial review of the scientific literature and research material currently available on the physiological and psychological effects of energy drinks. The committee has also drawn up a work plan which includes research on the consumption patterns of energy drinks in Ireland, a review of the marketing and advertising in Ireland of energy drinks, and an examination into the need, if any, for further research to be conducted in this area.</P>
    <P>The FSPB have undertaken to keep me informed of developments and I look forward to receiving the final report of the stimulant drinks committee towards the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork and Kerry diabetes and heart disease study investigated factors associated with the development of these diseases in samples of patients in 17 general practices. Cardiovascular disease risk factors, diabetes and related conditions were common in this population sample of men and women aged between 50 and 69 years.</P>
      <P>Almost 4% of those studied had adult onset diabetes but one third of these were unaware of their condition. Nearly half of the group was overweight and a further one quarter was categorised as being obese. Four out of ten reported low levels of physical activity. Approximately half of the population had levels of blood pressure which would warrant further attention though less than half of these were aware of any possible blood pressure problem. Eighty per cent of those studied had levels of blood cholesterol which were above the recommended level. One in five of the sample were cigarette smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cardiovascular Health Strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, made a number of recommendations on the prevention of heart disease and many of these are also relevant to the prevention of diabetes. In line with the priorities of the European Task Force on Prevention in Clinical Practice, a Programme of Structured Care of Patients with Cardiovascular Disease is now being developed. There is evidence that effective treatment of patients known to have heart disease can substantially reduce their risk of further heart <Col N="197" /> attacks and related diseases. The sum of £2 million has been allocated in 2001 for the first phase of the programme of structured care. This will be evaluated so that future phases can learn from the experience gained in implementing this first phase.</P>
    <P>The next priority is the identification of those at high risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, with a view to reducing the risk of onset of these diseases in the future. The cardiovascular health strategy group did not recommend check ups for whole groups of the population. There is already a substantial volume of risk factor measurement within the health services. The strategy group recommended that this type of opportunistic assessment should continue, with a very structured approach to the management of those identified as being at high risk.</P>
    <P>The cardiovascular health strategy also recommended primary prevention initiatives to reduce the development of risk factors in the population. Already, with the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy there has been expansion of such initiatives throughout the country, for example, to promote healthy eating and non-smoking. These build on the ongoing health promotion programmes for healthy eating, smoking cessation and initiatives to reduce the onset of smoking among young people.</P>
    <P>Awareness of the need to adopt a more healthy lifestyle was one of the main objectives of the first phase of the change of heart campaign in autumn 2000. In addition to the media campaign, a heart health handbook was distributed to every household in the country. The next phase of this campaign will focus on physical activity. This will encourage young people to participate in sports or other activities that they enjoy. Older people will be reminded of the benefits of remaining active, for example by going for a walk on most days of the week. The media campaign will be supported by the physical activity co-ordinators appointed by many of the health boards.</P>
    <P>A combination of primary prevention in the general population and secondary prevention in those known to have heart disease can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of heart disease and related conditions in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 63, 141 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; and the report of the Medical Manpower Forum were brought to Government yesterday, 3 April 2001, for consideration and approval.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the decisions by the Government in relation to the two reports. The recommendations contained in both these reports were achieved by consensus and on a partnership basis. The reports represent a significant step forward for the health services in that they map out a set of proposals for the reduction of NCHD hours to the level required by the EU directive. The Government has welcomed the progress made towards the implementation of the 48 hour week for NCHDs and the revised structures for medical training.</P>
      <P>The report on NCHD working hours was undertaken in response to the EU directive to reduce the working week to 48 hours by 2010. The immediate task is to get to 58 hours by 2004 and interim measures to start this process will be taken this year. The report also contains recommendations on major changes in the way doctors are trained, flexible working arrangements and family-friendly policies. A national task force will be established to prepare a detailed implementation programme for the EU Working Time Directive followed by further consideration by Government of the costs involved. The task force will also have to quantify the resource requirements arising from the report's recommendations. I propose to appoint the members of the task force and get the process under way as quickly as possible. The decision to set up a special task force is proof of the Government's determination to implement the EU directive in the most effective and efficient way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to medical manpower, the Government has noted the recommendations in relation to a consultant-delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a costing study <Col N="201" /> on the matter which is also to be undertaken by the newly established National Task Force on Medical Manpower. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the reports, including flexibility-cover arrangements, teamworking, etc. and on the issues highlighted in report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The report of the Forum on Medical Manpower sets out proposals for the structuring of consultant posts both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken. The national task force will undertake this exercise in tandem with the work to be done on resource and other requirements in relation to the EU directive. There are likely to be very significant financial and staffing implications which will require careful consideration by Government. It is important that this study produces detailed and accurate data on the number of staff and the costs involved.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will now be made for the publication of both reports.</P>

      <P>Comparisons between this country and other European countries are mainly based on the EUCAN database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the WHO. This gives estimates of cancer for all EU countries for 1995. Detailed analyses of these figures are given in annual reports of the National Cancer Registry.</P>
      <P>I am sending the Deputy tables giving the total number of estimated cases for each EU country for 1995, the number of cases per 100,000 population, the number of cases per 100,000 population, adjusted for age, the rank of each EU country within the EU and the national rate as a percentage of the EU average.</P>
      <P>The data show that cancer incidence in Ireland for the major cancers is 3% above the EU average, is highest in Europe for colorectal cancer, large bowel, 24% above average for breast cancer, 15% above average for prostate cancer and close to the average for lung cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Cancer incidence for all sites other than breast cancer is higher in the US than in Ireland or Europe as a whole. Comparisons with US data are less reliable than with European figures because of the limited coverage of cancer registration in the US until recently.</P>
    <P>This data show that in Ireland, cancer incidence and mortality rates for all cancers combined, are higher than comparable EU average figures. The reasons for this would include variations in health behaviours such as cigarette smoking, dietary factors, alcohol consumption, as well as genetic and racial factors. It is vital that our focus is both on the prevention of cancer where possible, and on early and appropriate intervention for those who develop cancer. My Department, through the implementation of the health promotion strategy, is attempting to reduce the impact of adverse health behaviours. My Department is also implementing the national cancer strategy and other strategies which have arisen from it such as the symptomatic breast disease services report which provides for high quality services through centres of excellence for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</P>

The number of cases reported in the same period last year was 697. This represents an increase of 16.5% in 2001 over 2000. As the Deputy is aware it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions from provisional data over a period as short as three months. Details of cases of gastroenteritis contracted by children under two years of age over the last three years are as follows:</P>

      <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. The aims of the review process are to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this review is to address the following issues: the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being met; the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme; the need and the likely future demand for private nursing home care; the supply of nursing home care in the future; the role of the nursing home sector in an integrated public-private care system; the role of the social economy in an integrated, community-based, long-stay care system; optimal funding arrangements for long-stay care; and the major policy questions for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Documents recently released by my Department under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, include correspondence between my Department and the Department of Finance. These documents show that a draft of the expenditure review includes a suggestion that consideration should be given to a provision which would enable the State to claw-back some of the cost of <Col N="204" /> subvention from the estate of deceased beneficiaries of the scheme. This suggestion is one of a number of proposals made by the author of the review. As the review is still in draft form, it would be inappropriate for further comment to be made without the full findings and recommendations of the review being available for consideration.</P>

      <P>The admission and discharge of patients from hospitals is solely a matter for the relevant clinician to determine based upon clinical priority.</P>
      <P>Provisional data for 2000 shows that there were 23,544 cases of patients being re-admitted to hospital within one week of discharge. The comparable figure for 1999 was 24,447. These figures are derived from HIPE &ndash; Hospital In-Patient Enquiry &ndash; data which gives details of activity in publicly funded acute general hospitals in the State. HIPE records episodes of care and, therefore, the figures could include a number of re-admissions associated with the same patient. The figures include all in-patient re-admissions i.e. re-admissions for the same condition or an unrelated condition or planned re-admissions. It is also relevant to point out that there were over 870,000 in-patient discharges in 2000; thus the figure of 23,544 represents less than 3% of all discharges.</P>

      <P>The Think Twice Every Time campaign which I launched last November is targeted at men and women in the 18 to 35 year old age group. The aim of the Think Twice Every Time campaign is to help to inform and empower people about their relationships and their sexuality. The principal message of the campaign is that both partners are responsible for their own and each other's sexual health. In particular, both partners must take responsibility for preventing unwanted pregnancy and avoiding sexually-transmitted infection. The campaign seeks to raise awareness about a range of issues, including the fertility of the body, how pregnancy occurs, the safe and correct use of contraception, the prevention of sexually transmitted infection and the effect that alcohol can have in relation to decision making and risk taking.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the campaign will involve a number of focused initiatives, including regional workshops, a media poster campaign and a national seminar. However, some of these initiatives have been postponed in light of the foot and mouth outbreak and will be rescheduled for a later date. Plans are also well advanced in the production of a website and a public information booklet. The campaign, which has an annual budget of £400,000, will run for an initial period of 12 months. The campaign is being implemented in partnership with the health boards, other statutory and non-statutory bodies and a variety of interest groups.</P>

    <P>A summary pre-school inspection report detailing any deficiencies is forwarded to the pre-school provider as part of the inspection procedures. The provider is required to reply to the report within a given timeframe, outlining the measures that will be put in place to deal with the deficiencies. If the deficiencies noted during inspection are of a serious nature and the team feels that there is a potential risk to the safety of the children, the provider is so informed and a follow-up inspection will be carried out within a shorter period of time to ensure compliance with the recommendations of the inspection team.</P>
    <P>In general, where deficiencies in services are identified during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way, provided any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The experience of the pre-school inspection teams is that the majority of pre-school providers wish to achieve a high standard of service and work in partnership with the teams to achieve and maintain this standard.</P>
    <P>Where serious breaches of the regulations concerning the health, safety and welfare of children identified during an inspection are not rectified within specified timescales, health boards can bring the matter to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In the budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the decision taken to make retrospective payments to those who were adversely affected by the provisions of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, which allowed for the assessment of circumstances.</P>
      <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The provision which allowed for this assessment was deleted from 1 January 1999. This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and/or daughters of applicants.</P>
      <P>However, I feel it is important to state that legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nonetheless, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in Government agree. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I would also like to assure the Deputy that medical card holders who have entered private nursing homes have the same entitlements to drugs and medicines as medical card holders living in the community.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my concerns on the issue of sport sponsorship and alcohol promotion and a number of actions have been taken which are relevant to this issue. The recently published Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport, published by the Irish Sports Council and Sports Council for Northern Ireland states &ldquo;Sports leaders in children's sport should refrain from seeking sponsorship from the alcohol and tobacco industries.&rdquo; I have requested officials of my Department to consult the Sports Council with a view to progressing this recommendation.</P>
      <P>In addition, an alcohol awareness campaign specifically aimed at young high-risk drinkers has just been launched. This campaign, Less is More &ndash; It's Your Choice, is in line with the national alcohol policy, published by my Department in 1996, and aims to create an awareness among young people of &ldquo;high risk drinking&rdquo; and in the long-term aims to reduce alcohol related problems associated with excessive drinking.</P>

      <P>An investment package of £32 million was provided on foot of phase 1 of the national review of bed capacity. This funding is being used to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period. Among the initiatives being funded is the recruitment of 29 additional accident and emergency consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this <Col N="211" /> key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending accident and emergency departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision making service.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the recruitment of additional consultant manpower, Comhairle na nOspidéal has commenced a review of the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review will take into account the report of the medical manpower forum, policies of the Irish Accident and Emergency Association and the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons, international best practice, the views of health authorities, management, medical practitioners and other relevant matters. I am confident that the findings of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the provision of services within hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the report of the director of public health in the Southern Health Board region regarding the incidence of suicide in Cork and Kerry in the years 1997 and 1998. The report was compiled for inclusion in the annual report of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The report relates to a detailed analysis of suicides in 1997 and 1998. There were 95 deaths in Cork and Kerry in 1997 and 91 deaths in 1998. Of these 186 deaths 80% were males. Some 30% of these deaths were of men aged 16 to 25 and 56% of men aged under 36. The peak age groups for women were 26 to 35 and 46 to 55.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is currently training 50 staff in the mental health service in relation to dealing with suicide and parasuicide in the community. The board also has a support team available to respond to any request for assistance. <Col N="212" /> Crises nurses are being placed in accident and emergency departments to deal with parasuicides attending. Awareness talks on mental health issues are being held in schools. A pilot project which commenced last year involving the placement of psychiatric nurses in GP practices has attracted a large number of young people seeking help and support.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is part funding a suicide research post in conjunction with the National Suicide Research Foundation. It has employed a mental health resource officer whose main function is to co-ordinate the implementation of the board's strategic plan on suicide.</P>
    <P>At national level considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on suicide which was published in 1998. Many of the task force's recommendations require continuous development, particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national suicide review group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide and was a core recommendation of the task force report. This group was established in 1998. Membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. The main responsibilities of the group are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards. Last year, the group published its first annual report which provides a comprehensive overview of activities in suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>Health boards have established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. The working groups are multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary and engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provide information in relation to suicide and parasuicide, liaise with the media and provide training requirements for staff in relation to all aspects of suicide and parasuicide. Resource officers with responsibility for implementing recommendations of the task force have been appointed in all of the health boards. Their responsibilities include the recruitment of additional staff, the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.</P>

      <P>The provision of services at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, is the statutory responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board. I understand from the board that the first of the three patients referred to by the Deputy presented to the hospital on 16 November 2000 at approximately 2 p.m. There was no emergency bed available and all the female beds in the hospital were full. As a result the hospital set up a bed in the corridor for this patient and screened off the bed from observation by others. The patient miscarried at 11 p.m. that night and was transferred to theatre and the gynaecological ward the next morning.</P>
      <P>The second patient was admitted for emergency care on 5 December 2000. On the previous day, 4 December 2000, nine elective patients were admitted for surgery on 5 December 2000. At the time of admission of the patient, all beds in the gynaecology ward were full. The patient had to be maintained in a bed on the corridor and screens were provided around the bed to improve privacy.</P>
      <P>The third patient was not admitted to the corridor. This patient was given a bed in the obstetrics unit where she miscarried. It was the only bed available to her at that time.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board very much regrets these incidents. I understand that the board has reviewed its admission policy and strengthened the role of the bed manager at the hospital with a view to ensuring that similar cases do not arise in the future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to Government last year and identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the national bed review is now under way and involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical speciality. This phase of the review is due to be completed in April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the childhood immunisation programme is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards. Since December 1995, general practitioners have been contracted by the health boards to deliver the primary childhood immunisation programme.</P>
      <P>When this issue came to light, my Department requested the health boards to conduct a detailed examination of records in order to establish the extent to which the administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date had occurred in the period January 1998 to December 2000. The information to date, which is not yet complete, suggests that in excess of 11,000 doses were administered out of date and that of this quantity approximately 5,000 doses were administered more than one month after their expiry date. It should, however, be noted that in any one year period some 200,000 doses of oral polio vaccine are administered to approximately 100,000 children as part of the primary and booster childhood immunisation programmes.</P>
      <P>I requested expert advice in relation to the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee has advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases. My Department has written to the chief executive officers of the health boards advising them that parents of any children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation.</P>
      <P>Health boards have been requested to examine how the administration of out of date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners who have been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
      <P>In view of this incident health boards have been asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and put in place revised systems or procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information i.e. patient <Col N="215" /> name, batch number and expiry date by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>

      <P>According to information which has been provided by the National Cancer Registry, the death rate from cancer in the State increased from 147 to 218 deaths per 100,000 per annum from 1950 to 1998, an increase of 48%. The factors in this increase were: (1) population ageing: this accounted for 9% of the increase. After correction for age, mortality in men can be seen to have increased by 46% and that for women by 12%; (2) lung cancer, which has increased from 1.5 deaths per 100,000 in 1950 to 44.4 per 100,000 in 1998. This accounted for 40% of the increase; (3) prostate cancer accounted for 9% of the increase and breast cancer for 7%; (4) ovarian cancer and lymphoma each accounted for 6%, cancer of the pancreas for 5%, leukaemia and brain cancer 4% each, cancer of the bladder, cervix and melanoma for 2% each and cancer of the colon for 1%; (5) the increases in mortality from these cancers were partly counterbalanced by decreases in mortality from cancer of the stomach and rectum. I am not in a position to comment on data from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most research in the area of carrying &ndash; manual handling &ndash; is related to work practices and therefore deals with adult populations. However, there are two known studies that compare the physiological parameters of different methods of carrying school bags, Malhorta &amp; Sengupta, 1965, and O'Regan &amp; Dockrell, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In both studies, while hand carriage was the least economical, the rucksack or backpack method proved to be the most economical in physiological terms. A further study &ndash; Pascoe et al, 1997 &ndash; investigating the effects of carrying on the gait and posture of 11 to 13 year olds, found that bag carrying affects the normal gait pattern. The subjects carried 17% of their normal body weight and the research found that a one-strap bag promoted greater side bending of the trunk <Col N="216" /> compared with a backpack worn over both shoulders. A backpack worn over both shoulders was shown to induce greater forward lean of the trunk than a one-strap bag.</P>
    <P>This forward lean was further demonstrated in a study on the effects of carrying school bags of ten year old children by Kennedy et al, 1997. The subjects carried weights in a rucksack type school bag that were proportional to 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of their own body weight. Results showed a significant forward lean of the trunk when subjects were carrying the school bag which became more exaggerated with increasing load magnitude.</P>
    <P>While lifting and carrying have been associated with back pain in adults, this association has not been established for back pain in childhood.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I appointed a working group to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The recommendations of the group in its report presented to me in July 1998 included: an awareness raising campaign in all primary and post-primary schools; examining the feasibility of providing appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers; to continue to afford the option of book storage in the case of new post-primary schools.</P>

    <P>Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; 291</P>
    <P>Some 275 persons with an intellectual disability are currently accommodated in St. Joseph's intellectual disability service on the St. Ita's campus. St. Joseph's intellectual disability service provides residential care in dedicated accommodation on the campus and is separate from the mental health service. Some 30 residents are scheduled to transfer to purpose built accommodation in Oldtown, County Meath, in the current year. Planning is at an advanced stage for similar bungalow complexes on the hospital campus to accommodate a further 60 residents. The development plans for the Northern Area Health Board for the next five years provide for the transfer of the remaining residents in St. Joseph's services to more appropriate accommodation, which will include both refurbished and purpose built accommodation.</P>
    <P>Two of the remaining 16 persons are appropriately placed within the mental health services and the needs of the 14 others will be reviewed as part of the ongoing development of the services.</P>
    <P>Midland Health Board &ndash; 26 persons</P>
    <P>A project team has been established to plan and implement a programme to provide alternative placements for those accommodated in St. Fintan's and St. Loman's, in addition to the de-designated units in St. Peter's, Castlepollard, Alvernia Centre and Lough Sheever and to enhance the overall level of services available to these centres. Four properties have been purchased to date, in addition to a site in Clara, County Offaly, on which a number of bungalows are to be built. A project manager is being appointed to oversee the implementation of this programme.</P>
    <P>Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; 85 persons</P>
    <P>A total of 36 persons will, over the next few weeks, begin to move from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick, to new facilities in the Daughters of Charity Services, Lisnagry. A new unit has been built for 25 persons accommodated in Our Lady's, Ennis. Plans are currently being prepared for the remaining 24 persons in St. Joseph's, Limerick.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 19 persons</P>
    <P>The board is in the process of re-locating the small number of persons remaining in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee. Six persons will transfer to a community group home in July and discussions are taking place with St. Mary's, Drumcar, concerning alternative placements for a further four persons.</P>
    <P>North-Western Health Board &ndash; 15 persons</P>
    <P>The remaining 15 persons resident in St. Conal's Hospital did not want to move when others were given alternative accommodation some years ago. All are now elderly and will be moved later this year to appropriate placements within the geriatric services.</P>
    <P>South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 116 persons</P>
    <P>A total of 21 persons will be moving from St. Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny, to new purpose built accommodation later this year. A similar facility for a further 21 persons from Kelvin Grove, Carlow, is at an advanced stage of planning. A premises to accommodate eight persons from St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy, has been identified and discussions are taking place with the board concerning plans for the remaining clients in this hospital. Funding has also been provided for alternative day facilities for persons accommodated in St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board &ndash; 33 persons</P>
    <P>Some 29 of the 45 persons with an intellectual disability who were accommodated in St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney, have moved to new purpose built facilities. It was intended that the remaining 16 persons would transfer to community based services with Kerry Parents and Friends Association. However, it now appears that only six persons will move to the community, with the remaining persons requiring a psychogeriatric service. Funding has been allocated to enable this process to commence. The majority of the remaining 17 persons currently accommodated within the other psychiatric facilities within the board's services require a psychogeriatric service.</P>
    <P>Western Health Board &ndash; 60 persons</P>
    <P>Some 28 persons will be transferred from St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe, this year to community based facilities and to a purpose built facility for 12 persons. Between ten to 12 persons from St. Mary's Hospital will be transferred to Aras Attracta, Swinford. Discussions will take place over the coming months with the board in respect of their plans for the remaining 20 persons.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, much progress has been made in recent years in meeting the needs of this population group and I would like to assure him that this Government is committed to an ongoing programme of investment in this area.</P>

      <P>These types of cases are generally known as social admissions.</P>
      <P>Information supplied by health boards indicates that approximately 21 children were placed as social admissions in hospital beds in the Midland, the North Eastern and South Eastern Health Boards in 2000. These three boards have indicated that these placements were made in emergency situations and were short term: not all of the children so placed were in the care of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>Information in respect of the Eastern Regional Health Authority area boards and the Southern Health Board is not yet to hand and I will communicate further with the Deputy when it is available. The other health boards, that is, the Mid-Western, the North Western and the Western Health Boards, have indicated that they did not make any such placements in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that health boards are continuing to develop prevention and early intervention measures together with a range of family support services to minimise the need for children coming into care. Where children require care outside of their family for a period of time, health boards provide foster care and residential care services.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office it has invested an additional £90 million in revenue in the child welfare and protection services. This has allowed for very significant improvements in the services and these improvements will continue. In particular, substantial additional funding has been made available to health boards in 2001 to support vulnerable children by targeting and assisting families identified as needing particular support and for the development of foster care, emergency accommodation and residential care.</P>

      <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the arrangements for the provision of speech and language therapy services are a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that, while there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for both pre-school and children of school going age with intellectual disability, autism, physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statutory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to take a flexible approach in using the resources which have been allocated to the services, including the possibility of the purchase of additional sessions, with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services.</P>
      <P>I have just received the report that I commissioned from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in relation to workforce planning for speech and language therapy. I am currently considering its implications and will shortly be in a position to announce developments in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. The aims of the review process are: to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme; and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this review is to address the following issues: the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being; met the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme; the need and the likely future demand for private nursing home care; the supply of nursing home care in the future; the <Col N="223" /> role of the nursing home sector in an integrated public-private care system, the role of the social economy in an integrated, community-based, long-stay care system; optimal funding arrangements for long-stay care; the major policy questions for the future.</P>
    <P>Documents recently released by my Department under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, include correspondence between my Department and the Department of Finance. These documents show that a draft of the expenditure review includes a suggestion that consideration should be given to a provision which would enable the State to claw-back some of the cost of subvention from the estate of deceased beneficiaries of the scheme. This suggestion is one of a number of proposals made by the author of the review. As the review is still in draft form, it would be inappropriate for further comment to be made without the full findings and recommendations of the review being available for consideration.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. The whole eligibility framework for health services generally is also one of the key issues to be addressed in the new health strategy currently being prepared by my Department. It is expected that this strategy will be published in the summer.</P>
    <P>It is, however, worth noting that when this Government came into office in 1997, the budget made available for the nursing home subvention scheme was £27.8 million. In 2001, the level of funding made available for the scheme has almost doubled with £52 million being made available, including the resources necessary to facilitate the recent increases in the rates, bringing them to £90, £120, and £150 per week in respect of medium, high or maximum levels of dependency.</P>
    <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that this Government has allocated significant resources to services for older people, particularly health services, in an attempt to deal with the change in demographics, and the resulting issues, which will emerge. Additional funding for the development of health services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, while in 2001 an additional £57.427 million has been provided. This has resulted in approximately 880 posts approved to services for older people between 1997 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000 over 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1000 day places per week have been provided in ten new day care centres.</P>
    <P>A total of £2.0 billion has been made available by this Government for investment in the health <Col N="224" /> services under the national development plan. This represents a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service. In the case of services for older people it is proposed to provide a greatly improved physical environment to ensure a high quality and client-centred service. Approximately £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. A broad range of facilities will either be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result including assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, daycare centres and services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness. Current mental health policy, including the provision of care to the homeless mentally ill, is based on the recommendations contained in the report Planning for the Future which was published in 1984. The report recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community oriented. Successive Governments have pursued this policy and the move from an institutional to a community-based setting has resulted in many improvements in our mental health services. New mental health centres, day hospitals and other day facilities have been set up and at the same time additional community-based residential accommodation has also been made available. The number of hostels for the mentally ill in 1983 stood at 111 providing 942 places, increasing to 398 in 1999 and providing 2,923 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In implementing Planning for the Future many patients were given rehabilitation and social skills training to enable them to live independently in the community and health boards provided hostels or community residences to people moving out of psychiatric facilities. While it is acknowledged that those leaving residential care may be at risk of becoming homeless, research undertaken on former long-stay patients of St. Brendan's Hospital shows that virtually no former long-stay patients have become homeless. On the contrary, it is seen to be more likely that the problem lies with new patients presenting to smaller <Col N="225" /> psychiatric units based in general hospitals for psychiatric disorders which are but one component of substantial social disorganisation. This is often complicated further by alcohol and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has issued guidelines setting out the discharge policies and procedures which should be in place in each hospital and acute psychiatric unit. A clear discharge plan should be designed for each patient, to ensure that all appropriate information is given and all appropriate services arranged prior to the patient's actual discharge. This includes checking to ensure that the patient has suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are presently working on the preparation of a strategy designed to prevent homelessness. The objective of this preventive strategy is to provide guidance to health boards to ensure procedures and policies are in place to reduce the risk of people leaving institutional care becoming homeless. This preventive strategy includes arrangements for people leaving psychiatric facilities.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the decision taken to make retrospective payments to those who were adversely affected by the provisions of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, which allowed for the assessment of circumstances.</P>
      <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The provision which allowed for this assessment was deleted from 1 January 1999. This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and-or daughters of applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I feel it is important to state that legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nonetheless, it has been decided that moneys should <Col N="226" /> be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in Government agree. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

The number of traditional medicinal products on the market is increasing and the fact that they are largely unlicensed and not subject to control is a matter of concern. There is increasing interest in these products and I am concerned to ensure that the public interest is protected and that there is no undue delay in ensuring that this objective is achieved.</P>
      <P>The debate on traditional medicinal products has also highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level in regard to the regulation of these products. While the matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee in 1999, it is not anticipated that there will be an early resolution to the significant lack of harmonisation in this area. In recognition of these difficulties I have asked the Irish Medicines Board and officials of my Department to investigate the possibility of developing an interim licensing system for traditional use products which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has recently submitted an interim report on the matter to my Department and has set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to advise on scientific and policy issues relating to the proposed scheme. This group includes persons with backgrounds in both conventional and non-conventional medicine. The Irish Medicines Board is anxious to <Col N="227" /> ensure that the general public and interested organisations have a mechanism by which to make their views known in the course of this process. I share the board's concern in this matter. The board is therefore continuing to consult with the various interested groups and individuals and has advised me that following further consultation with interested parties, a draft of the final proposal will be submitted to me later this year.</P>
    <P>I have also proposed that a consultative forum be held to discuss the issue of statutory registration of providers of non-conventional medicine and therapy. A date for this forum has yet to be decided, but it is likely to occur in the course of this year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this forum will be to explore the practical issues that would be involved in preparing a system of statutory registration for these practitioners. These issues have already been initially discussed in talks between officials of my Department and representatives of the relevant professional bodies. Due to the complexities of this issue, I propose to engage a consultant to arrange and facilitate the forum and to work with the relevant therapists in examining the issue further. The issues to be addressed in this exercise will include the following: the categories of therapist to be covered &ndash; qualifications, scope of practice, experience, protection of the public, and promotion of a quality service.</P>
    <P>Any body of work will naturally have to take account of the regulatory situation governing alternative therapists in other countries and the proposals which my Department is developing for the health and social care professionals.</P>
    <P>In the interim, the Department encourages the various therapeutic groups to develop mechanisms for informing the general public of the availability of services from reputable therapists and to establish their own voluntary regulatory structures in preparation for a scheme of statutory registration. Many have embraced this form of self-regulations and adopted codes of practice and ethics, professional profile portfolio based registers, complaints procedures and insurance schemes within their own membership facility.</P>

      <Quest>the reason life expectancy here is so far behind France.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While Ireland's life expectancy rates are behind those of France, it is important to recognise that health status and mortality rates are influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowment; the physical and emotional nurturing they receive; the lifestyle they adopt; the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as <Col N="228" /> well as the access they have to quality health and personal social services in times of need.</P>
      <P>A high proportion of mortality and morbidity rates in Ireland are caused by chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. A range of measures are in place to improve health status and mortality rates. These include the national cancer strategy, the national cardiovascular health strategy and the health promotion strategy.</P>
      <P>The national cancer strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%. Since the launch of the strategy, about £60 million has been invested in a range of service developments under the strategy, to the benefit of all, including in particular those socio-economic groups at a greater relative risk of contracting cancer due to environmental or lifestyle factors.</P>
      <P>Cardiovascular diseases cause over 40% of all mortality in Ireland. Last year saw the first year of an investment programme following on the adoption of the cardiovascular strategy launched by the Taoiseach in late 1999. A total of £14.4 million has been allocated to fund the strategy this year. The report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts, showed that our premature death rates from coronary heart disease for men and women are twice the EU average. The medium term objective of the strategy is to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. The longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU. Building Healthier Hearts, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
      <P>Last year, I launched the health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005 which includes specific strategic aims and objectives to contribute to the overall health improvement of the Irish population.</P>
      <P>The overall budget for the health services in 2001 is now over £5 billion. This represents a 48% increase over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality and effective health service. The £2 billion earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-2006 represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. This investment will provide a physical infrastructure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will also be an ingredient in improving the mortality and morbidity in our society.</P>
      <P>I am currently developing a national health strategy which I intend to launch in mid-year. The new national health strategy will build on the current strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, 1994, and will provide a blueprint for the strategic development of the health services over the next five to ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> All of these strategies together with this Government's programme of investment continue to contribute to the ever growing improvement in life expectancy rates that have been taking place in our society.</P>

      <P>The main conclusions of the report are that laboratory experiments have provided no good evidence that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are capable of causing cancer nor do human epidemiological studies suggest that they cause cancer in general. There is however some <Col N="230" /> epidemiological evidence that prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency magnetic fields is associated with a small risk of leukaemia in children. In the absence of clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells, the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The figures for the December 2000 quarter published recently show that the number of people on hospital waiting lists fell by almost 25%. This downward trend in numbers is reflected in annual reductions in the waiting list for target specialities.</P>
      <P>Between December 1999 and December 2000 the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 66%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 50% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 45%.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 56%, the number waiting for general surgery for more than six months decreased by 53%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 37% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 20%.</P>
      <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputies that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The placement and care of children under the Child Care Act, 1991 is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. I have been informed by all the health boards that there are no children held in units run by private security companies at <Col N="232" /> present and that it is not the policy of health boards to use private security staff for the purpose of providing care for young people.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to Community Children's Centre Limited which is a private company set up to provide child care services, as distinct from security services, and which operates a number of small units in a number of locations in the eastern region. I understand from the health boards that this company has taken over the work of the child care division of Secureways Limited. While Secureways Limited originally provided security services for the former Eastern Health Board, it subsequently established a separate child care division and recruited child care staff specifically for this service. The area health boards have informed me that Garda clearance and references are obtained before staff are employed by Community Children's Centre Limited.</P>
      <P>The area health boards in the eastern region have also informed me that currently they have 17 children with Community Children's Centre Limited and that these arrangements are closely monitored by individual social workers. Meetings take place on a regular basis between senior health board staff and management of the Community Children's Centre in relation to these services. This service is availed of as an interim measure as the boards are currently developing a wide range of new and alternative services for children and young people in the region. None of the other health boards outside the eastern region has children placed with the Community Children's Centre.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, residential homes operated by the health boards are subject to inspection by the social services inspectorate, while children's residential centres not operated by health boards are subject to inspection by health boards. The social service inspectorate provides training for, and holds regular meetings with, health board inspectors to ensure the standard of inspection of voluntary children's residential centres is in line with that of the social services inspectorate.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the area health boards in the eastern region that the homes run by the predecessor of the Community Children's Centre were visited by the former Eastern Health Board's inspectorate shortly after it was established. Visits were made simultaneously to all other non statutory services providing residential care in the eastern region. Each service was given advice and guidance as well as information on the template for inspections. In addition, all services were facilitated simultaneously at a one day seminar-workshop. Last month the regional registration and inspection service for the eastern region inspected one of the Community Children's Centre facilities and the other centres will be inspected as part of the inspection services work programme.</P>

Notwithstanding this ruling, I decided to waive my claim for privilege over the documents within my power, including documents held in the Chief State Solicitor's office which may cast light on my Department's state of knowledge during the lead up to the 1991 HIV settlement regarding the source of the HIV infection of persons with haemophilia. These documents were produced to the Lindsay Tribunal on 2 March.</P>
      <P>While I have not had any discussions with the parties who have not waived their claims for privilege in relation to the Lindsay Tribunal, I would encourage them to follow my lead in this matter. As the chairperson said, the right to claim privilege is a fundamental one which is vested in the individual, or the individual corporate body, and the independent status of the bodies who are parties to the tribunal was referred to by the chairperson in her ruling. The question of whether to waive privilege is a matter for each party to decide for itself.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the North-South Ireland food consumption survey which was conducted by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance. This survey highlights the levels of obesity and physical activity and compliments the national health and lifestyle surveys published by my Department in February 1999.</P>
      <P>Two key lifestyle issues associated with obesity and low fitness levels are healthy eating and physical activity. The national healthy eating campaign, run by the health promotion unit of my Department, has over the past eight years raised awareness among the general public on healthy eating based on the food pyramid. Recently the campaign has encouraged members of the public to look at their fat intake and to reduce total fat, in particular saturated fat. This campaign identifies that the key to a healthy lifestyle is small gradual changes to eating and exercise habits to maintain the correct body weight. The theme of this year's national healthy eating campaign is ready, steady, go for low fat healthy eating and will address key eating and physical activity issues associated with obesity and low fitness levels.</P>
      <P>In relation to physical activity, the second phase of Ireland Needs a Change of Heart &ndash; a national mass media campaign to promote heart healthy lifestyles &ndash; is focusing on physical activity. This campaign is due to be launched in June and it will target the sedentary population, in particular older people and the workplace.</P>

      <P>The administration of the childhood immunisation programme is a matter for the health boards. Since December 1995 general practitioners have been contracted by the health boards to deliver the primary childhood immunisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this issue came to light, my Department requested the health boards to conduct a detailed examination of records to establish the extent to which the administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date had occurred in the period <Col N="235" /> January 1998 to December 2000. The information to date, which is not yet complete, suggests that in excess of 11,000 doses were administered out of date and that of this quantity approximately 5,000 doses were administered more than one month after their expiry date. It should be noted that in any one year period some 200,000 doses of oral polio vaccine are administered to approximately 100,000 children as part of the primary and booster childhood immunisation programmes.</P>
    <P>I requested expert advice on the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee has advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases. My Department has written to the chief executive officers of the health boards advising them that parents of children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation.</P>
    <P>Health boards have been requested to examine how the administration of out of date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners which has been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
    <P>In view of this incident health boards have been asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and to put in place revised systems-procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Health boards have also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information, that is patient name, batch number and expiry date, by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority has acknowledged the need to increase the number of beds within the entire region and the northside of Dublin city has been <Col N="236" /> identified as a particular priority. A feasibility study will be carried out in 2001 to clearly identify where these beds should be located in the best interest of the patient and in line with best practice.</P>
    <P>In addition, the ERHA acknowledges the need to improve the quality of service within the existing hospital facilities. To this end a number of reviews have been or will be undertaken in relation to the following areas: A and E services; bed capacity; renal dialysis services; out-patient services; intensive care facilities; and MRI services.</P>
    <P>The capital projects which have been approved and are currently in various stages of implementation on the existing hospital sites are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>James Connolly Memorial Hospital</i>Approval to proceed with redevelopment of the hospital was issued in September 2000. Construction is currently under way and the target completion date is early 2003. Phase 1 of this development includes the following departments-facilities: ward block; department of rheumatology; coronary care; intensive care; psychiatric department; surgical day unit; operating theatres; accident and emergency; mortuary and post-mortem; and waste marshalling.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mater Hospital</i>Funding has been provided in the national development plan for the redevelopment of the Mater campus to include expanded and improved facilities for the existing Mater hospital and the building of a new children's hospital which would replace the Children's Hospital at Temple Street.</P>
    <P>The design brief has been completed and approved by my Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The main clinical areas to be provided in the development are an accident and emergency department; an out-patient day care and ambulatory care facilities; operating theatres including day surgery; heart lung facilities; ITU-HDU; pathology; diagnostic imaging; 80 additional beds; pharmacy; and a new children's hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beaumont Hospital</i>A sum of £25 million was approved for a major equipping and refurbishment programme which is currently in progress. Funding has also been approved to enhance the renal dialysis services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rotunda Hospital</i>In 2000 a capital grant of £4.5 million was approved for capital works at this hospital. These works include the amalgamation of the paediatric unit with the neonatal intensive care unit and work on the third floor extension. The hospital has recently tendered for the work as approved and the design team's report on the tenders received is being considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" />
      <i>Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital of Ireland</i>The project team has recently completed its review of the brief for phase 2 of the hospital development. It is proposed that this development will include one 32 bed ward to replace the orthopaedic rehabilitation beds in the veranda ward and two additional 32 bed wards to provide secondary rehabilitation for older persons together with physiotherapy-occupational therapy-speech therapy and other support facilities. The updated brief has been received and a request to advertise for a design team to progress the development is now being considered.</P>
    <P>I should also add that approval in principle has recently been given to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to purchase St. Joseph's Private Hospital, Raheny, Dublin. A range of services are being considered for the site, including the provision of specialist and day care services with the aim of reducing the number of public patients currently on waiting lists for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20 March I announced the commencement of phase 2 of the national immunisation programme aimed at the prevention of group C meningitis. Phase 1 of this campaign was launched by me on 20 October 2000.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 will target primary school children as a priority. The vaccine will be administered free of charge in schools by health board vaccination teams or by general practitioners in some areas.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 of the campaign was aimed at those at greatest risk of contracting the disease; children under five years of age and young persons aged 15 to 18 years. This phase of the campaign is now almost complete and preliminary uptake information available from health boards is positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This success is reflected in data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre which indicate a significant reduction in group C meningococcal disease notifications over the past five months since the launch of the campaign. In the period October 2000 to February 2001 37 cases of group C meningitis were reported compared with 84 cases over the same period in the previous year. This represents a 56% reduction which is very significant and highlights the importance and success of the campaign to date. In the same period there has also been a 24% reduction in the number of group B cases. The more marked reduction in group C is attributable to the vaccine and it is gratifying to see a reduction in cases at this early stage of the campaign. The reduction in group B cases may in part be due to the reduction <Col N="238" /> in flu like illness this winter as influenza is a known risk factor for meningococcal disease.</P>
    <P>Anyone targeted by phase 1 of the programme but who has not been immunised should contact their general practitioner or student health representative immediately in order to avail of the free vaccine. Young persons aged 19 to 22 years and post-primary school students aged 12 to 14 years will be targeted when the current phase 2 is completed.</P>
    <P>This vaccine has been incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme and all children will receive the vaccine free in addition to the existing vaccines which are administered at two, four and six months of age.</P>
    <P>Meningitis C is a very serious disease and a public health hazard. It is a devastating condition with a significant mortality rate. It can also cause long-term disabilities in the form of developmental delay, hearing loss and neurological damage. I encourage all parents to have their children immunised against this disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has overall responsibility to ensure that a co-ordi<Col N="240" /> nated, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse is in place.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned the objectives of the health response to the drugs problem are based on two key elements, reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which is a return to a drug free lifestyle.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, runs or is involved in a number of initiatives which are aimed at tackling and reducing the number of young people misusing substances nationwide and most particularly within the eastern region, where the majority of problem drug misusers reside. These initiatives include supporting drug education and prevention programmes and social and personal health education which is a broad based lifeskills programme for junior certificate students in schools. A support service to implement this programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with the health boards, the Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The substance abuse prevention programme On My Own Two Feet will be incorporated into the SPHE programme in the future and the Walk Tall programme will continue to be implemented in primary schools. Teachers and schools are also often supported by regional health education officers from the health boards.</P>
      <P>Within the youth sector the national youth health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nationwide. The programmes supported include the Youth Work Support Pack for Dealing with the Drugs Issue, Knowledge is Power and Drink Awareness for Everyone. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and youth work leaders to assist them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also, within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the community setting Drugs Questions, Local Answers is a community based programme offered by health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drugs problem specific to their own area and then to look at ways in which the community can respond to the issues arising. The programme was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department and is delivered regionally by local people who have been trained in delivering the programme. Being Well is another community based programme which has been developed by the health promotion unit. This programme <Col N="241" /> encourages people to take a holistic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol. Again this programme is supported by regional health boards and delivered by local people who have been appropriately trained.</P>
    <P>The health boards also support a range of parenting interventions such as Family, Communication and Self-esteem. This is a parenting programme which aims to look at ways in which parents can pro-actively deal with the issue of drugs within the home. Health boards also fund a number of voluntary organisations whose work involves prevention and treatment of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over the past number of years. Funding has been provided to the regional health boards to considerably strengthen the infrastructure for the delivery of drugs services. In the eastern region treatment services have expanded from three locations in 1995 to the current 55. The number of people receiving treatment has risen from 1,358 in 1995 to more than 5,000 now. In an independent review of the drug services of the Eastern Health Board published in 2000 the authors found that:</P>
    <P>There has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the services in the EHB over the past four to five years . . . A programme of service expansion was embarked on that is probably one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress achieved to date there are waiting lists for drug treatment. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has received additional funding in 2001 to address this situation. The authority, in conjunction with the area health boards, will work towards tackling this problem with the overall aim of eliminating these waiting lists.</P>

      <P>A major advertising campaign formed part of the nurse recruitment and retention initiative announced by me on 29 November last. Some 550 calls were made to the free telephone lines in Cork and Dublin in response to the campaign. Callers interested in returning to nursing and midwifery employment were facilitated in making direct contact with relevant health service employers.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency is finalising a national survey of nursing vacancies existing on 31 January 2001. An encouraging finding is that there was a net increase of over 1,270 nurses in the system during the year ended 31 January 2001. The full findings of the survey will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy problem. A total of 896 working visas-work authorisations were issued to nurses from non-EU countries between June 2000 and February 2001. A number of hospitals in the Dublin area are reporting dramatic improvements in their position. For example, Beaumont Hospital announced recently that it had a full complement of nurses while at one stage last year it was short 130 nurses.</P>

      <P>Health board chief executive officers, with significant input from my Department, undertook a major review of general medical practice which they completed last September. In particular the review was concerned to systematically enumerate those existing infrastructural difficulties which currently impede progress and to provide a vision of the future development of general practice.</P>
      <P>I recently obtained Government agreement to move forward in this area. The next stage of the review process will therefore involve a major consultative exercise with the relevant representative bodies, in particular, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners which have jointly produced their own vision statement on the future development of general practice. That statement will also be fully considered in the planned consultative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed consultative stage of the review process will be a very wide-ranging one. It will address all aspects of general practice, including <Col N="243" /> infrastuctural issues relating to practice organisation, the provision of appropriate out-of-hours primary care services, the scope for the provision of preventative services in general practice, better linkages with other healthcare sectors, computerisation, etc. I envisage that the consultative process will commence in the next few weeks. Given the nature and scope of the challenge involved, it is likely that it will extend over a considerable period.</P>
    <P>The end result of the review process will be the establishment of the structures and strategies necessary to ensure the proper development of general practice over a timeframe of several years as a key part of the integrated health care service of the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, was introduced for the primary purpose of safeguarding the welfare of young workers healthwise, safetywise and educationwise. My Department's policy is to enforce the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, in a proactive manner as a response to the inherent need itself and public-political expectations and demands.</P>
      <P>When the Act came into operation, details of the legislation were sent to all post-primary schools, relevant trade unions and employer bodies, the main supermarket chains, petrol stations, hotels, restaurants and vintners associations, fast food chains and youth organisations. Last year those details were also sent to third level institutions as well as education officers in the relevant student unions. It is part of the business plan of my enforcement section for 2001 to again make contact with all post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Act sets limits for the employment of children, that is persons under 16 years of age, and young persons, that is 16 and 17 year olds. It also sets rest intervals and maximum working hours and prohibits the employment of people under 18 years to do late night work. Employers must keep specified records of their workers who are under 18 years as well as displaying prominently a poster summarising the main rules on employing such young people. This poster is available on request from the employment rights information unit of my department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing employment legislation generally, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. All inspectors carry out night work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to PYP <Col N="245" /> enforcement work. The statistics available to me indicate that since January 2000 to date 2,705 inspections have been carried out under the protection of young persons Act. The inspectorate's responsibility under this Act is taken seriously as evidenced by their business plan for 2001 which provides for a minimum of 12% of the working time of inspectors to be carried out at night time in the enforcement of the PYP. Breaches of the Act may come to the attention of my Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. Inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records.</P>
    <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation, the matter is referred to my legal advisers to consider whether legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer concerned in respect of the alleged breach of the Act. Experience of the labour inspectors is that most PYP irregularities found by them in the course of their inspection operations are resolved through the co-operation of the employers in question. Where such co-operation is not forthcoming it is the Department's policy to prosecute.</P>
    <P>Following referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal action against offending employers six employers were convicted in 2000 in respect of breaches of PYP legislation. In one further prosecution initiated in 2000 the employer was not convicted but was ordered to pay compensation to the young person concerned. To date in 2001 four employers have been convicted of breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <P>While there is a legal obligation on employers to see that the law is upheld in this area there is also a moral responsibility on parents to ensure that the objectives of the protection of young persons Act, in regard to both the protection of the education and health of children and young persons, are not frustrated. As previously stated on a number of occasions, I urge parents and teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the labour inspectorate unit of my Department. Such reported breaches will be dealt with and every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with the 1996 Act.</P>

      <P>The company, which has been in Ennis since 1962, announced <Col N="246" /> the closure of its Irish manufacturing operation on 28 March 2001. The closure will be effective from the end of May 2001 with the loss of 85 jobs out of the current employment level of 87 jobs. The remaining two employees are sales representatives who will continue to service the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The company stated that the decision to close is a direct result of a non-competitive cost base in Ireland compared to more cost effective production within the group's other facilities in Malta and China. An additional factor is the impact generated by low cost competitors in a competitive world-wide marketplace.</P>
      <P>The FÁS employment services manager for the mid-west region met the general manager of the company on 2 April 2001 and outlined the full range of services that will be made available to the workers. These include guidance and career counselling, matching for job vacancies and the provision of training courses, as required. A FÁS employment officer based in Ennis will be assigned to deal specifically with the company.</P>

      <P>The company, which was established in Shannon in 1989, laid off 90 of its 187 temporary employees on 27 March 2001. The permanent employment base at Shannon of 535 is not affected. The reasons for the lay-offs are directly associated with the slowdown in the US economy, over stocking of high volume product and a general reduction in demand from telecommunications providers in the US and, to a lesser extent, in Europe.</P>
      <P>Officials from the FÁS mid-west region have been in contact with the company regarding the services available from FÁS, for example, guidance and career counselling, matching for job vacancies and the provision of training courses as required.

      <P>On 7 March 2001 the company, which has substantial manufactur<Col N="247" /> ing operations in Shannon since 1961, announced the closure of one section of its manufacturing operations in Shannon, its diamond synthesis plant, with the loss of 128 jobs. These job losses are being effected through a combination of voluntary redundancy and early retirement.</P>
      <P>The synthesis process is carried out at a number of locations world-wide and a decision has now been made to consolidate this activity in three plants. The underlying reason for the consolidation is competition from the Far East, specifically China, Korea and Japan. Shannon will remain as the company's only plant to process synthesised diamonds &ndash; the high value added end of the business. The Shannon company will also continue to host most of the corporate activities of the group. The ongoing staff level will be more than 500.</P>
      <P>Officials from the FÁS mid-west region have made contact with the company to offer assistance to those being made redundant. The company is using a consulting group to assist employees in assessing the options open to them. The group has been advised of the services available from FÁS, for example, guidance and career counselling, matching for job vacancies and the provision of training courses, as required. A FÁS employment officer based in Shannon has been assigned to deal with the consulting group in relation to the company's employees.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development will work closely with management at the company in its strategy to develop new activities for its Shannon operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 27 March 2001 I appointed an expert task force to advise me on transport logistics in connection with commercial seaports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time transport logistics will be assessed for our seaports which handle 99% by volume of our imports and exports. As the Deputy will be aware, the number one port in the <Col N="248" /> State is Dublin and it is increasingly suffering from congestion. Handling a throughput of some 21 million tonnes in 2000 out of a total national ports throughput of 43 million tonnes, it is at the heart of Ireland's transport chain. It is a fact that many ports are located within or in proximity to busy and often congested city and town centres. We need to do everything possible to ease traffic congestion at ports like Dublin and at the other key seaports serving the national and regional economies.</P>
    <P>It is vital for all our major seaports at Greenore, Drogheda, Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare, Waterford, New Ross, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Galway as well as Dublin &ndash; that we all work towards achieving a seamless transport chain from road or rail through ports and that we do this in a way that avoids delays, congestion and environmental damage and adds to Irish competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to specifically examine the potential for increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail including the development of rail head facilities at existing ports; transport of freight across transport modes by night-off peak times; rail, road and shipping; and opportunities for traffic diversion including by rail and pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms to other less congested ports outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The group will also seek to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient, identify cost effective options for the movement of port related traffic through Dublin and the possibility for transfer of non-essential activities away from ports.</P>
    <P>The task force is chaired by Dr. John Mangan of the Irish Management Institute, an expert in transport logistics. It also includes experts from the ports and shipping industries, local authorities, Departments, Iarnród Éireann as well as the social partners and independent specialists from the transport and other sectors. In relation to environmental assessment and protection, I specifically made provision to include a representative from the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the task force to ensure that all matters relating to the environment are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The task force has invited submissions-representations from interested bodies or people as part of a wide-ranging public consultation process. Statutory and non statutory bodies dealing with environmental matters have been invited to make submissions.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the task force consult widely and take on board the views of all interested parties, especially those who rely on sea transport and the ports industry for their livelihoods.</P>

It is a commercial decision for Dublin Port Company to decide whether it wishes to suspend work on the preparation of this EIS pending the completion of the task force's assessment. Therefore, it would be improper of me to request the company to suspend work on its preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three basic measures to support electricity production from renewable energy sources. They are competitive tendering, fixed feed in tariffs and green certificates trading.</P>
      <P>The alternative energy requirement programme administered by my Department to support the building of a renewable energy based electricity generating plant has relied on competitive tendering to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competitive tendering has the advantage that it minimises the additional cost of purchasing <Col N="250" /> each unit of electricity from renewable energy above its equivalent produced from a conventional source. A high fixed feed in tariff system has the predictable impact that it will increase the costs of procuring renewable energy based electricity. A certificates trading scheme would require primary legislation to create demand for the certificates and the establishment or extension of a regulatory regime to monitor trading, compliance and to prevent fraud which would also increase costs.</P>
    <P>The renewable energy strategy group in its report to me recommended a modified fixed feed in tariff scheme for the next AER competition, AER V, based on competitive prices delivered in AER III. The terms and conditions of the competition are under active consideration and I will make an announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce legislation to establish a certificates trading scheme at this time.</P>

      <P>Consequently, most of his entitlement under the 1999 extensification premium was offset against land annuity arrears for the year 2000. In total, a sum of £1,345.28 out of the 1999 extensification premium of £1,380.16 due on animals paid under the 1999 special beef premium scheme and the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme was so offset on 9 June 2000. The balance of £34.88 was paid to the person named on the same date. A further £54.72 was recouped on 31 May 2000 against land annuity arrears from his entitlement under the 1999 special beef premium Euro top-up. Payments under the 2000 extensification premium scheme will be completed in June 2001.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the scope of these reliefs has been widened each year since the introduction of the first relief. Tax relief is now available for undergraduate students studying abroad, post-graduate students studying here and in the EU. This year's Finance Act has merged the existing four tax reliefs and will allow tax relief for post-graduate students studying outside the EU for repeat years and for more than one course. It is likely that these changes will increase the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief for third level fees.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-06, as initially produced, provided for public investment of £40.6 billion in 1999 prices. The cost of the plan as published is now estimated at £47.4 billion in constant 2001 prices. This estimated cost in 2001 prices is based on the increase in the building cost index and the increase in the consumer price index for 2000 and inflators of 9% for infrastructure and 3.5% for current expenditure as used in the 2001 Estimates for Public Services.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the plan, an essential precondition for the major level of investment in the plan is the continuation of stable macroeconomic and budgetary policies. The Government is committed to this fundamental policy position. Accordingly, the annual allocations and ultimately the overall NDP commitment will have to be kept to a level that respects the public expenditure ceilings set by Government, takes account of wider budgetary priorities and accords with the requirements of economic stability.</P>
      <P>The priorities and multi-annual allocations in the NDP, as published, reflected the assessment of the situation in 1999. Over the period of a seven year plan priorities can and do change in line with prevailing economic and social circumstances. Under the arrangements for monitoring the NDP its implementation is continuously monitored and kept under review. Reprogramming decisions may be taken by the monitoring committees in respect of Structural Funds co-financed expenditure and by Government in regard to non co-financed expenditure. This may involve the switching of resources between operational programmes and measures within OPs to reflect changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Provision for Exchequer expenditure under the plan is made in the Estimates for Public Services and the public capital programme and is subject to the overall requirements of macroeconomic and budgetary stability which I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 2001, provides for a new scheme of capital allowance for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date. The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write-off will only be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally, the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis then the cost can be written off against the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability in the Cork region is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance. Therefore, I have forwarded your inquiry to the chief executive of the board for attention and direct reply. While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available <Col N="256" /> to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
      <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
      <P>I have just received the report that I commissioned from Dr. Peter Bacon and associates in relation to workforce planning for speech and language therapy. I am currently considering its implications and will shortly be in a position to announce developments in this area.</P>
      <P>Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is section 8 of the Finance Act, 2001, which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there is adequate encouragement for people with medical interest to train as general practitioners. This is reflected in the fact that the number of applicants for places on the GP vocational training programme with the Irish College of General Practitioners in the current year was 163. So great is the level of interest that the college actually increased the number of training places this year from 54 to 63. The number of doctors interested in providing services under the GMS scheme is also increasing. The current number of participating doctors is just over 1,750, as compared with 1,679 at the end of December 2000 and 1,629 from the corresponding time in the previous year. In addition to those contracted doctors, there are also, in many cases, assistants providing services to medical card patients.</P>
      <P>However, I would add that the whole issue of developing general practice in a strategic and structured way is a matter to which I am committed. In moving forward, I will have regard to the review of general medical practice, carried out by the health board chief executive officers, and the joint vision statement prepared by the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation. In that context, the need to keep general practice as an area of high interest to medical graduates and professionals, will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>Female circumcision, or female genital mutilation, is a harmful traditional practice which continues in some developing countries. It constitutes, in my view, an assault which causes serious harm to girls and women on whom it is carried out. It is also my view that such an act is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. Accordingly the introduction of specific legislation on this issue is not considered necessary at this time.</P>

      <P>The Avondale and Crannóg centres, together with an after care department, comprise the Carlow/Kilkenny residential child care services of the South Eastern Health Board. The services are staffed on the following basis:</P>
      <P>One residential child care manager has overall responsibility for the services.</P>
      <P>Avondale: There are eight full-time posts (one houseparent/unit manager and seven assistant houseparents). All posts are currently filled by permanent child care workers, seven of whom have relevant qualifications. In addition, there is one part-time domestic staff member.</P>
      <P>Crannóg: There are 10.5 full-time posts (one houseparent/unit manager and 9.5 full-time permanent positions, 7.5 of which are filled by permanent qualified child care workers. The other two posts are filled by temporary qualified child care workers and I am informed that a recruitment process is being initiated to fill these positions permanently. In addition, there is one part time domestic staff member.</P>
      <P>After care: 0.5 temporary post, currently filled by a qualified child care worker.</P>
      <P>In addition, the health board employs 25 temporary assistant houseparents who cover a large range of duties, including special projects that need to be set up for individual children within the service. They also cover annual leave, sick leave, career breaks, parental leave etc.</P>
      <P>There are seven places in Avondale and five in Crannóg. Crannóg operates on the basis of each child having his or her own bedroom. However, it can cater for seven children when it is appropriate for siblings to share a room. There are currently five residents in Avondale, and four in Crannóg. Formal supervision is provided on a three to four weekly basis on an individual basis for all staff members. This is provided by the residential child care manager and the houseparents/unit manager in each unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the South Eastern Health <Col N="260" /> Board that 95% of the permanent positions are filled by staff members with recognised child care qualifications. It is the aim, where possible, to staff the service with qualified child care staff. Finally, I am informed that, where the Board has identified the need for more staff to support specific care plans for individual children, this has been provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of services at Letterkenny General Hospital is the statutory responsibility of the North Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Major developments in the treatment and care of patients with cancer have taken place since the launch, in November 1996, of the national cancer strategy. It is intended to continue to build on these significant developments. In this regard, the National Cancer Forum set up a specialist expert group to examine the symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country. The over-riding objective underlying this review was to develop our breast cancer treatment services to an optimal level that ensures the highest possible quality of care and the best opportunity for long-term survival for breast cancer patients.  A sub-group of the National Cancer Forum undertook a detailed review of the symptomatic breast cancer services and their recommendations are contained in a report entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease. I accept the broad thrust of this report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the North Western Health Board, the report recommends that there should be one specialist breast unit in the area. The report acknowledges that there is a committed group of people providing symptomatic breast disease services at present in Letterkenny. However, there is not a sufficient volume of patients to develop and maintain the expertise of the staff concerned. The board is currently considering how best to utilise the expertise present in this unit, and is exploring the possibility of linking with a unit in Northern Ireland, with a view to coming to an arrangement in order to increase caseload, experience, expertise and formal cross-cover.</P>
      <P>The board is cognisant of the fact that whatever services are put in place must be of the highest standards possible and that outcomes for patients must be favourably comparable with international standards. To this end, the board is in consultation with the Northern Ireland health services, while at the same time having discussions with its own hospital consultants and management. The board has informed me that it expects these consultations to take some time and when negotiations are concluded, formal proposals will be put to the board in the usual way. I am confident that these deliberations and consultations on the future provision of services for symptomatic breast disease, will result in an enhancement of the services currently being provided.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that Statutory Instrument 438/2000 European Communities (Purity Criteria on Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) (Amendment Regulations, 2000) is adequate to ensure traceability of ingredients manufactured in third countries and ultimately sold into countries of the European Union and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities (Purity Criteria on Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) Regulations, 2000 (Statutory Instrument No 438 of 2000), transpose into national law the Commission Directive 98/86/EC, amending Commission Directive 96/77/EC, laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners. The general rules on food additives other than colours and sweeteners are laid down in European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC as amended. This Directive lays down the additives permitted in food, the types of food in which they are permitted and the levels at which they are permitted and was transposed into national law by the European Communities (Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 288 of 1999).</P>
      <P>Directives 96/77/EC and 98/86/EC concern the specifications and analytical techniques for all approved additives. The specifications ensure that additives are safe and do not contain harmful substances that can be carried in to foodstuffs. They also ensure good manufacturing practice and lay down criteria of acceptability. S.I. No. 438 of 2000 is not intended to ensure traceability, which is a feature of the labelling legislation and specific commodity legislation. It is also a feature of the company's liability to produce safe food. Certain proposals at EU level address the issue of traceability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft regulation of the European Parliament and Council, laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, addresses the issue of traceability. This regulation proposes to establish a comprehensive system of traceability, so that targeted and accurate withdrawals can be undertaken, or information given to consumers or control officials. This draft regulation places an obligation on a food business, including an importer, to identify at least the business from <Col N="263" /> whom the food has been supplied, to ensure that on investigation, traceability can be assured at all stages. It is considered that a food business operator is best placed to devise a safe system for supplying food and ensuring that the food it supplies is safe and should, accordingly, have primary legal responsibility for ensuring food safety.</P>
    <P>The EU proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council, on the hygiene of foodstuffs, introduces certain principles to improve traceability. Provision is also made for foodstuffs imported into the Community to comply with the Community hygiene standards, or with equivalent standards. The proposal contains a uniform procedure for organising imports, from non-member countries, of products of animal origin destined for human consumption. These procedures consist essentially of the following steps: Audits and/or assessment of the competent authority performance and on-the-spot inspections to verify compliance/equivalence with EU requirements; establishment of a list of non-member countries matching EU standards; establishment of import conditions and certification requirements for each non-member country and establishment of a list of establishments in non-member countries meeting EU standards.</P>
    <P>In fulfillment of the European Commission's commitment to ensuring that the highest levels of health protection are offered to the European consumer, the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) was established in the Directorate-General for Consumer Policy and Consumer Health Protection in April 1997. The principal mission of the FVO is to monitor and control how member States and third countries implement EU legislation on food safety, animal health, plant health and animal welfare, and to contribute towards the maintenance of confidence in the safety of food offered to the European consumer. It fulfils this mission by carrying out a programme of inspections to monitor the performance of competent authorities, including audits and on-the-spot inspections of individual establishments in both member states and third countries.</P>
    <P>The FVO aims to ensure that imports into the EU are safe and are produced under conditions at least equivalent to those in the EU. EU directives and regulations set the standards to be met by animal products originating in the EU and also set down equivalent standards in relation to imports. Countries wishing to export food to the European Union are first required to demonstrate that, for the specific products they wish to export, they have, and can maintain, safety standards at least equivalent to those applicable in the EU. The FVO assesses the competent authority in third counties and the reliability of their control systems and certification.</P>
    <P>For a wide range of products, third countries must apply to be included on an approved list prior to exporting to the EU. Normally a country will only be included after the Food and Veterinary Office has carried out an initial inspection of <Col N="264" /> the control systems in the applicant country and has recommended that it be included on a list of approved countries. Animal and/or public health conditions and certification have to be agreed and laid down in Community legislation. In addition, once a country has been included on an approved list, it must provide a list of all establishments in that country that have been approved as meeting the required standards set down for export to the EU. The rules governing the importation of food of animal origin into the European Union require that all such imports must come through designated border inspection posts, authorised and equipped to carry out specified checks and controls.</P>

      <P>My Department is advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that to date, 11 candidates have been appointed, have been offered, or are being offered temporary contracts, on foot of the decision to recruit additional consultants in accident and emergency medicine in acute general hospitals. In addition, I understand that interviews have been scheduled with a view to the early recruitment of a further ten consultants. The remaining eight posts may need to be readvertised. With regard to the consultant anaesthetists, my Department is informed that four candidates have been appointed to date and that arrangements are continuing for the appointment of further consultants in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that it typically takes over 12 months to complete recruitment of a consultant on a permanent basis. In the circumstances and with a view to increasing, as soon as possible, the number of consultants working in accident and emergency departments and in anaesthetics, it was agreed with Comhairle na nOspidéal that the additional appointments in these key areas would initially be made on a temporary basis. It is evident from the progress report that I have presented above, that the initiative has reduced the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of additional consultants. I look forward to continuing progress in these areas over the coming months and I am confident that the posts involved can be filled in the current year.</P>

      <P>My Department does not maintain a listing of counselling agencies. However I am informed by the Southern Health Board that the following agencies offer pregnancy counselling in Cork: Cork Family Planning Clinic, 23 Tuckey Street, Cork; Cura, 34 Paul Street, Cork and Life, 123 Patrick Street, Cork.</P>
      <P>Many general practitioners offer pregnancy counselling services also.</P>
      <P>The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995, permits an advice agency or doctor to provide information about services outside the State for the termination of pregnancy, in the context of full counselling as to all available options. The Act requires that counselling services must not advocate or promote abortion and prohibits them from making any arrangements on a woman's behalf in relation to abortion services outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has indicated that no local study has been undertaken in relation to the decisions of pregnant women in the Cork area following counselling, or in relation to the number of women who have an abortion annually. A study entitled Women and Crisis Pregnancy, commissioned by my Department from the department of sociology of Trinity College, Dublin, was published in 1998. The study identified and discussed a range of factors which contribute to unwanted pregnancy in Ireland, the factors which lead some women to choose the option of abortion and those which lead others to continue with their pregnancy. The women who participated in the study were not identified and the report does <Col N="267" /> not contain information on where in Ireland they were resident.</P>

      <P>The following is the most up-to-date information available to me on those studying speech and language therapy in Trinity College, Dublin. Of the 26 students who entered Trinity College, Dublin, in the academic year 1999-2000, only one withdrew from the course and of the remaining 25 who took first year exams, 92% passed. There were 21 graduates from the course in the year 2000. This was out of a total of 25 who entered in 1996. Two others from that 25 are expected to graduate in 2001, giving an overall completion rate of 92%. Therefore the drop-out rate in the clinical speech and language studies course is low, in comparison to other courses.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, Trinity College, Dublin, has clarified that the drop-out rate cited in a recent newspaper article was a misprint and that three students, rather than five, have withdrawn from the course this year. Trinity College, Dublin, points out that attrition rates amongst first year, third-level students are traditionally higher than for any other year of a course.</P>

    <P>Overall hospital waiting list figures have gone down by almost a quarter since December 1999 and it is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies, to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <P>Phase two of the major capital development programme at Naas General Hospital commenced on site in November 1999 and is programmed for completion by mid 2002. Funding for the development is provided for under the national development plan. On completion of phase two, the hospital will have a total of 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the Psychiatric Unit provided under phase 1. Phase two includes the following facilities: main entrance concourse; administration part; medical records department; chaplaincy department; out-patients department; accident and emergency department; physical medicine department (temporary location); radiology department; mortuary/post mortem accommodation; pharmacy department; geriatric day hospital; operating department; day services <Col N="269" /> department; intensive care and coronary care units; in-patients wards; geriatric rehabilitation-assessment ward; staff changing, brought forward from phase III; on call accommodation, brought forward from phase three, and stores brought forward from phase three.</P>
      <P>I am advised that progress on phase two is 17 weeks behind schedule. This is due in part, to staff resourcing problems and exceptionally inclement weather. Every effort is being made to bring the project back on schedule.</P>
      <P>Approval to proceed with the commencement of the final phase three, of the Naas General Hospital development has been given. Phase three will complete the total hospital development and will include construction-completion of the following departments: administration (completion), pathology, hospital sterile supplies department, central supplies department, catering department, engineering-maintenance department, day services &ndash; permanent, physical medicine &ndash; permanent out patients department &ndash; completion, mortuary and post mortem facilities and waste management department.</P>
      <P>The design team is progressing planning documentation for this phase. It is hoped to lodge a planning application with the local authority later this month. construction is targeted to commence in mid 2002, with a completion date of June, 2004.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 to 169, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Age-standardised mortality rates for EU countries are provided by the World Health Organisation. The latest year for which an EU average rate is available is 1997. Table 1 below sets out the rates per 100,000 population for selected <Col N="270" /> forms of cancer and diseases of the circulatory system for the years 1993 to 1997.</P>
    <P>As the table shows, mortality rates for cancer in Ireland are higher than comparable EU average figures. The reasons for this would include variations in health behaviours such as cigarette smoking, dietary factors, alcohol consumption as well as genetic factors. The Department of Health and Children is, through the implementation of the health promotion strategy, attempting to reduce the impact of adverse health behaviours. The Department is also implementing its national cancer strategy and other strategies which have arisen from it, such as the symptomatic breast disease services report. those strategies are attempting to provide for high quality services, through centres of excellence for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It is vital, if such gaps in cancer incidence and mortality are to be closed, that our focus is both upon the prevention of cancer where possible and upon early intervention for those who develop cancer.</P>
    <P>Despite significant declines in recent years, mortality rates for heart disease remain high in Ireland compared to the EU average. The Department of Health and Children has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from heart disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. The report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner over a five year period. As a measure of the Government's commitment to the implementation of this report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to drive the implementation process.</P>
    <P>Estimated number of deaths from smoking are provided in the publication Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000, by Richard Peto and others. The estimates are based on an indirect method which uses the results of epidemiological studies of mortality in smokers versus non-smokers in the United States to assign proportions of total mortality due to tobacco for each relevant cause of death. The most recent year available in this publication is 1995 and it indicates that an estimated 20% of deaths (i.e. 5,881 persons) in Ireland in that year were due to smoking. Table 2 provides comparable percentages of total deaths attributable to smoking for each EU country.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. The current anti-smoking campaign, Break the Habit for Good, emphasises the positive effect quitting smoking can have on the individual and was launched in December 1998. The campaign involves national and local initiatives which offer support for those people wishing to give up smok<Col N="271" /> ing. It was developed in conjunction with the <Col N="272" /> Irish Cancer Society and a quitline offering professional advice is also provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his\her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services, if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In the budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over, to come into effect on 1 July, 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, under the programme for prosperity and fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the overcrowding and understaffing at the various accident and emergency units in hospitals throughout the country, if his attention has further been drawn to the conditions under which staff have to work and which patients must tolerate, his proposals to deal with this issue and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being encountered by various hospitals which provide accident and emergency services. The levels of attendances at <Col N="275" /> accident and emergency departments cannot be predicted accurately in advance. Periods of exceptional demand may be experienced and waiting periods for treatment may vary. This is particularly so during the winter period. However, every effort is being made to keep waiting times to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that A &amp; E departments are in a position to respond to the need for their services. Additional funding has been targeted at hospitals providing accident and emergency services. This was used to free up beds for emergency admissions, to enhance staffing levels, to develop treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and to improve access for general practitioners for urgent specialist opinion. A public education campaign has been undertaken, aimed at increasing public awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments and persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner.</P>
      <P>Capital funding has been provided for the development and enhancement of accident and emergency departments at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Cork University Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital, as part of overall developments at these hospitals. These projects will begin construction in 2001. In addition, a major expansion of the accident and emergency department at St. James's Hospital has recently been approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>The shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients requiring admission. In order to respond to this, I provided a £32 million investment package aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period. The investment package is being targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending A &amp; E departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision making service. Funding has also been provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) and the health boards. The ERHA and the health boards have contracted 761 beds up to 2 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspideal has commenced a review of the structure, operation and staffing of A &amp; E services and departments, with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review will take into account the report of the Medical Manpower Forum, policies of the Irish Accident and Emergency Association and the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons, inter<Col N="276" /> national best practice, the views of health authorities, management, medical practitioners and other relevant matters. The findings of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the provision of A &amp; E services.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the provision of orthodontic services. These difficulties are being addressed and progress is being made on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendations was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units, to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. In line with this, my Department is working to progress, with the relevant authorities, the establishment of training programmes for dentists to allow them to reach the level of specialist. An accord has been reached between the Dental Council the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry, to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dental Council has set up a specialist register which will recognise a dental speciality in orthodontics and the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register in orthodontics and creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health service, should mean a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service. I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade would act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant <Col N="277" /> impact on their waiting lists. As a result, funds of £5.3 million have been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients. A new orthodontic unit at Loughlinstown is currently being equipped. An additional five surgery unit at St. James's Hospital is also being equipped. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit, located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. The Southern Health Board is developing new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork.</P>
    <P>Based on the health boards' own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>

      <P>The special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, introduced from May 2000, is designed to benefit people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. This is achieved by affording additional recognition to social insurance contributions paid prior to 1953 and is in line with this Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age contributory pensions. To qualify a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance. The pension is paid at 50% of the maximum personal rate which will be £53 per week from 6 April 2001. To date approximately 13,500 people have benefited from the measure, including 8,500 people who had been in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> pension at less than 50% of the personal rate and for whom the new pension is more beneficial. Contributions made prior to 1953 are not counted for the purposes of satisfying the average contributions test. Consequently, pensioners who were already in receipt of a pension of at least 50% of the personal rate may not improve their position arising from this measure. Any further improvements in this area must be viewed in a budgetary context.</P>

The preparation of the plan involved an extended formal public consultation process to which many organisations and individuals responded. Also, officials of my Department met with key NGOs in January and explained in considerable detail the format and general approach of the draft plan. In addition, when the plan is published the NGOs will be invited to participate in the ongoing monitoring and review which is an integral part of the plan.

In January 2001, further information was requested from the applicant covering a number of matters, including effluent treatment, and a decision on the proposed development cannot be made until the planning authority receives this information. The planning authority did not initially refer the planning application to my Department. However, my Department became aware of it and asked the planning authority for a copy of it. This was received last month. The proposed development is being assessed by my Department and a sub<Col N="283" /> mission will be forwarded to the planning authority in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has, in recent years, adopted a new approach in relation to the funding of the improvement of bog roads under scéim na mbóithre áise, the accommodation roads scheme. Under the revised approach, funding is normally provided for a local co-operative or local committee to carry out the works, either by way of a FÁS community employment scheme or, alternatively, by the employment of a registered contractor. It <Col N="285" /> is a matter for the local co-operative or committee in question to obtain tenders, if necessary, and comply with all the other conditions of the scheme, including carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bog road referred to by the Deputy, my Department is currently evaluating an application for funding under the scheme which was received from Muintir an Chorráin for the improvement of this road. My Department was advised that only one registered contractor was available in the area to submit a tender. A decision on the application will be made in the near future.</P>

The age card scheme, which I initiated by way of regulations under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, is for persons who are legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol and who wish to do so. It would make no sense to make the scheme mandatory because it would then apply to all persons, even those who do not wish to enter a licensed premises.</P>

      <P>The Garda has informed me that in 2000 there were four seizures containing cocaine base, or crack, with a combined weight of 72.6 grams. All of these seizures occurred in the Dublin metropolitan area; three in the north central division and one in the south central division. I have also been informed that so far this year no seizures of cocaine base have been made. A special Garda operation is in place to investigate the availability of crack cocaine and a particular group is being targeted in this regard. The Garda <Col N="286" /> has assured me that gardaí continuously monitor and analyse the trends and patterns of illicit drug use and have informed me that there is no evidence to suggest a growing presence or the widespread availability of crack cocaine in Dublin or elsewhere in the country. The Garda is well aware from foreign experience of the addictive and behaviour changing nature of crack cocaine and, in this context, the incidence of cocaine base usage will be kept under review with the utmost importance being attached to investigations in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy has not provided details of the particular case to which he is referring, I have set out below the general position with regard to naturalisation for persons under 18 years of age. Section 15(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides <i>inter alia</i> that an applicant for naturalisation must be of full age. Section 16 of the Act sets out a number of circumstances in which the conditions specified in section 15 can be waived. These include the following: (i) where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations, or (ii) where the applicant is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of a minor child of the applicant.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not the practice of my Department to require minor children to apply separately for a certificate of naturalisation in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy where the parent's application on behalf of the child comes within the ambit of section 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to local drugs task forces in his question. Considerable progress has been made in ensuring that all institutions of State are working together to implement an integrated approach to the drugs problem through initiatives such as national drug strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the integrated services process. I am satisfied that these measures represent a balanced approach to the problems posed by drugs and drug addiction at local level. These measures to reduce the demand for drugs are vital to ensuring young people in particular are made aware of the danger of drugs and are given worthwhile and tangible alternatives to prevent them from falling into a cycle of drug misuse and crime.</P>
      <P>Fourteen local drugs task forces have been established in priority areas identified as having the most acute drugs problem, namely, Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Bray, the canal communities of Rialto, Bluebell and Inchicore, Clondalkin, Coolock, Darndale, Donnycarney and Kilbarrack, Cork, Dublin 12, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown, and Lower Crumlin, Dun Laoghaire, Rathdown, Finglas, Cabra, north inner city, south inner city, and Tallaght. A review of the national drugs strategy is almost complete. The aim of the review is to identify gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to develop them. This should ensure that current policies and strategies remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground. It is expected that the new strategy will be launched in the near future.</P>

I am further informed by the Garda that the number of house break-ins in the Cabra east area in the period 1 January <Col N="289" /> 2000, to 31 March 2001 was 23. I am also informed that in March of this year two additional gardaí were allocated to Cabra station and that, as a result, foot patrols in the area have been increased. I am assured by the Garda that community gardaí play an active role in the prevention of such crimes in the area.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, has two main purposes. The first is contained mainly in sections 2 to 4 which, in line with the constitutional referendum of 1996, set out that for cer<Col N="290" /> tain serious offences bail may be refused if the court is satisfied that it is &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo; to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the accused. The remaining sections were designed to tighten up the bail regime in general and apply to all offences, not just those scheduled as serious offences within the meaning of the Act. The introduction into law of these sections was of significance to all court offices. The table below shows the number of bails paid into the District Courts from 1 January 2000, until 15 May 2000, and between 16 May 2000, and 31 December 2000. The table also shows the amounts paid into court for the two periods.</P>
      <P>While the two time periods are not quite the same length, it is clear from the table that there has been a very large increase in the number of bails lodged in the District Courts as a result of the coming into force of section 5 of the Act. While the amount paid in has also increased, it has not increased to the same degree.</P>

      <P>Following a Government decision in May 2000, approval was given for the establishment of a National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, using the public-private partnership model. The National Maritime College will accommodate the Department of Nautical Studies of the Cork Institute of Technology and the Naval College of the Naval Service. Planning for the provision of the college is well under way in my Department. Following an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities </i>and in the national media, management consultants were recently appointed to support my Department's public-private partnership unit in the procurement of the project. In parallel with the process of appointing management consultants, an application for outline planning permission for the new college was submitted by the Cork Institute of Technology to Cork County Council in September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A project board has been established comprising representatives of my Department's public-private partnership, planning and building units, Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and the management consultants to oversee the implementation of the project. The project board has already commenced work and a prior information notice was published last month to ascertain the level of interest in the market from interested consortia. I understand that there has <Col N="291" /> been a good response from relevant groups in the project and it is proposed to advertise the project formally in the OJEC and in the national newspapers this month.</P>
    <P>Although at this stage of the process it is not possible to give the Deputy a detailed timetable for the project, it is my intention that the planning and provision of the new college is given top priority in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, parents or teachers are the first people to suspect that a child might have special educational needs such as dyslexia or ADHD. The usual procedure is that, following consultation with the parents of the child, the school refers the child for assessment to the appropriate service provider for that school. This may be a psychologist employed by the National Educational Psychological Service, or a psychologist or other professional employed directly by the health board or by a voluntary body working on its behalf. The service provider then arranges the assessment in consultation with the parents and school. Some parents arrange for private assessments. If special educational needs are diagnosed as a result of the assessment, the decision on referral for suitable placement is made by the psychologist or other professional who conducted the assessment, in consultation with the parents. I am not aware of the number of qualified people engaged in this work who are employed by health boards and voluntary bodies. There are 80 psychologists employed by the NEPS and all of them are fully qualified psychologists. The NEPS provides a service for all post-primary schools and approximately 1,300 primary schools. Under the terms of the Government's decision to establish the NEPS, it is expanding in a phased and orderly manner until every school will have access to its service. Pending this development, children from schools other than those served by the NEPS will be referred to professionals in the health sector. Even after the target of full coverage has been reached, it will be necessary for some children, particularly those with ADHD, to have multi-disciplinary assessments, involving professional personnel from both the education and health sectors.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Education Act, 1998, provides that each school board of management must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the expulsion and suspension of students. Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils. My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort. In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the National Educational Psychological Service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. While these measures provide protections for students, I have, in addition, brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, to address generally issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second-level schools. The Act requires schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. Schools will also be required to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to identify a mutually agreeable sol<Col N="294" /> ution to provide for the education of the student concerned. The automatic involvement of the officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department is finalising the arrangements relating to an appeals mechanism under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998. The establishment of appeals committees under this section will ensure that pupils and their parents will have an opportunity to appeal expulsions, suspensions or exclusions to an independent body. As part of this process, there will be provision for the appointment of facilitators whose task will be to attempt to resolve the difficulties that have arisen prior to a formal hearing of the case by an appeals committee.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. In relation to the income thresholds, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000 to 2001 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. <Col N="295" /> Under the third level student support schemes, operated under the aegis of my Department, means tested maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases, with the exception of all eligible mature students who, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, qualify for the <Col N="296" /> higher non-adjacent rate of grant regardless of distance from college. For 2000-2001 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710 respectively.</P>
      <P>Grantholders who do not meet the prescribed reckonable income limits for the full rate of maintenance may, by reference to specified higher income limits, qualify for a part maintenance grant of 50% of full rate. The reckonable income limits applicable to the 2000-01 academic year are outlined in tabular form below.</P>

    <P>I announced, last November, the establishment of a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>The individual third level colleges operate special admission arrangements for mature students, disadvantaged students and students with disabilities, outside of the general admissions procedure through the Central Applications Office.</P>
      <P>In the area of educational disadvantage, there is a range of initiatives spanning the first and second level systems and the transition from second to third level as well as at third level itself. As the Deputy will appreciate, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels. Most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding which I have provided for the universities through the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities and examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring. There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance for students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins my approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. Last September I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have now received the report of the action group. I am considering the recommendations and hope to be in a position to make an initial response in the near future.</P>

      <Col N="297" /> With regard to increased participation rates, The Social Background of Higher Education Entrants, and previous reports, compiled for the Higher Education Authority by Professor Patrick Clancy and Ms Joy Wall, tracks the changing social background of entrants to higher education in over almost two decades. The current work is based on new entrants to higher education in autumn 1998 and provides a comprehensive profile on the social background of entrants. The report shows that there has been a significant improvement in the proportion of students coming from the two lowest socio-economic groups entering higher education. In 1980, only 3% of students coming from the unskilled manual workers group entered higher education. This increased to 12% in 1992 and 22% in 1998. In 1980, only 9% of students coming from the semi-skilled manual workers group entered higher education. This has increased to 19% in 1992 and 23% in 1998. All groups show a participation rate of more than 20%, a major contrast with the position in 1980.</P>

      <P>In the case of secretarial and caretaking services, the Blackstock Group estimated that the cost of implementation of its proposals, using the salary converters identified, would be in the region of £10.3 million per annum. The group pointed out that this estimate related only to the second level sector, and that its proposals could have cost implications in the primary sector. Regarding support for school insurance, maintenance and minor repairs, while the group did not provide an estimate of the costs involved, because of the traditional anomalies in the funding mechanisms, it did identify a number of policy options in this regard. The group did not provide estimates of the costs involved in these options.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was introduced in 1996. The project seeks to target a programme of special supports on selected urban and rural schools, which were identified as being particularly disadvantaged through a survey of schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre. The criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself, were devised and carried out by the Educational Research Centre following detailed consideration of a range of indicators of educational disadvantage. In the case of the rural dimension, the Educational Research Centre concluded that the initiative should focus on groups of schools each of which had fewer than five teachers and whose proximity to each other was such to create a cluster which was capable of being served by one locally based co-ordinator. On the basis of these criteria and the survey outcome, schools were selected on the basis of priority of need. The operation of the pilot project is being closely monitored by my Department and it is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. A further comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. A number of accepted socio-economic variables, were used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey outcome forms the basis of the new programme, giving children an even break, which I announced in January last to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Over 2,300 primary schools will benefit under the programme, based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme and, or, Breaking the Cycle pilot project retain their entitlements under those schemes and may also be eligible to received additional supports under the new programme. Where schools have expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they have been advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. These representations will be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department will then further consider the position of these schools.</P>

      <P>My Department is not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The National Educational Psychological Service is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. The NEPS can advise on the <Col N="301" /> management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible. In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's guardian which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service on behalf of this child.</P>

      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme, the school referred to by the Deputy has the services of a full-time caretaker. While my Department provides funding for the school in question in respect of the caretaker's salary, the board of management of the school is his employer. Payment of salary to the board of management issues on an annual basis in two instalments one in January and the balance in October. However, because the caretaker in question exhausted his entitlement to paid sick leave during the period July to October 2000, an overpayment to the school authorities occurred. A refund of the moneys owed has been sought from the school. The caretaker is entitled to, and claimed disability benefit from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the duration of his sick leave. He is entitled to 91 days paid sick leave in any 12 month period as part of his conditions of service. However, any moneys claimed from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs during the period while he was on paid sick leave, are refundable to the Department of Education and Science. Officials of my Department issued a letter to the principal of the school in question on 15 March last clearly setting out the details of the refund owed to this Department from the school authorities. As the money was paid to the board of management as the caretaker's employer, it is a responsibility of the board to ensure that the overpayment is refunded.</P>
