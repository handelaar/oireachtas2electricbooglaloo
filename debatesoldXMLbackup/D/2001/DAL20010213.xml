      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judge Barron is the sole member of the Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin/Monaghan and Dundalk bombings which is independent and as such he is not required to report progress. <Col N="446" /> However, I understand that his inquiries are progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>A further advertisement &ndash; Mr. Hamilton had previously placed an advertisement in the newspapers &ndash; was placed in daily and Sunday newspapers, North and South, in mid-January, appealing for anyone with relevant information to contact the commission. The commission is anxious that everyone with information involved in the production of television programmes and press articles relating to the bombings should contact and co-operate with the commission as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the concern of many people about the slowness of this inquiry, notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances that led to the change of chairperson, and has he conveyed to Judge Barron the sense of urgency that is shared by all in the House? Can he give any indication as to when some degree of finality can be brought to the issue, whether it is to indicate that nothing further can be done or that there is a positive line of inquiry? The people who contacted me are very anxious that a sense of urgency be injected into these proceedings and that some degree of certainty, even if negative, is obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. It is urgent and it was hoped we would have had the report of the commission of inquiry by now and it would have been referred as promised to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights meeting in public session to consider what could be done. An effort is being made to go through everything possible.</P>
      <P>I thank Judge Barron who understands this and would like to complete his work. He is undertaking a very thorough examination involving a fact finding assessment on all aspects of the bombings and their sequel, including facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the bombings, the Garda investigations and looking at the papers, including the relevant papers that he can receive from Northern Ireland. He is dealing with the new Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, to see how he can assist. He is particularly anxious to talk to all of the journalists, particularly those involved with the &ldquo;Hidden Hand &ndash; The Forgotten Massacre&rdquo; television documentary. New advertisements were placed in January for this reason. I understand he is still seeking other papers in order to conduct a thorough investigation. As the late Judge Hamilton said, the whole effort is to use this period to see if enough evidence and substantive papers are available to see what the committee can usefully do. I hope we reach that stage as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I underline the urgency of the situation. As time goes on some people in positions of authority are getting older and some are deceased so there is a crucial urgency that this is brought to a speedy con<Col N="447" /> clusion. The Victims Commission and the former Tánaiste, Mr. Wilson, reported the belief among many of those they interviewed, the relatives or victims of the atrocities, that hidden hands were at work in organising the deaths of their loved ones or in protecting their identity. There was a suspicion that Governments here were less than enthusiastic in pressing the British Government for the real truth of possible involvement by their state forces. Have the Garda authorities given all information that they have to the inquiry on the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings? Has there been any investigation by the Taoiseach's office as to whether there was evidence that previous Administrations did not pursue the British Government very strongly in attempting to get at the truth of whether there was security force involvement? Does the Taoiseach know what co-operation the British Government has so far extended to this inquiry? Have all the relevant papers been given? Are some papers being withheld? What is the Government doing to ensure that all documentation and everything known to the British Government and security forces is handed over so that the truth can be discovered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of all Deputies that we must do everything we can within the extensive terms of reference agreed in consultation with the Justice for the Forgotten group. A solid basis for discovering the truth is the object of the exercise. I am very grateful to Judge Barron for accepting this task. It will involve an enormous amount of paper work to search back through the years. To the best of my knowledge, his requests for documents and assistance from the Garda Síochána have been answered. Judge Barron is not answerable to me on this matter and he will issue his report in due time.</P>
      <P>The former Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, promised that the papers from Northern Ireland would be sent to the inquiry. A certain amount but not all of them have been sent. These papers are not being withheld, rather they have not yet been passed on. There is co-operation from everyone involved in this inquiry. Public notices were published in January asking for anyone with information to come forward, particularly journalists and photographers who covered the events. There is an enormous amount of records and this House has decided that the commission of inquiry is the best way to deal with this. Even though time has moved on, all the records are available and they will be examined by Judge Barron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Taoiseach last raise this matter with Prime Minister Blair? There is a perception that the British Government has been less than co-operative because of the allegations of collusion between the RUC, British military intelligence and the UVF. Is this a matter the Taoiseach has vigorously pursued with the Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="448" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. I have raised this issue over many years and I was anxious that we pursue it in this House and try to get to the bottom of it. I understand the Deputy's concern. Over the years I have had contacts with various groups and organisations dealing with Bloody Sunday of January 1972. I am aware of the concerns that these groups still have. They are worried that the rifles used on that day have been destroyed. Thousands of photographs taken that day are missing and many other records do not seem to be available. While the Bloody Sunday tribunal set up by the British Government is doing good work, the Ministry of Defence, another arm of the state, is not providing material. This is a big issue in Northern Ireland. I requested the former Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, and I will ask the present Secretary of State, that any information should be provided to this commission of inquiry.  </P>
      <P>I have raised the matters of Bloody Sunday and the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings on numerous occasions. All available information will be communicated to the investigating authorities by the British Government. Experience has shown that usually not all information is available to Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the current relationship with the North, does the Taoiseach accept his role in urging those who are required to co-operate with the Barron and Saville inquiries to do so? A number of high-profile republicans are refusing to co-operate with the Bloody Sunday inquiry. If Judge Barron has not got all the information he needs at the end of the inquiry into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, will the Taoiseach consider a sworn inquiry? Before he became Attorney General, Michael McDowell urged the Government to do so. Has he advised the Taoiseach to keep an open mind on having a full sworn inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These issues were debated at length in this House two years ago. Deputy Quinn, myself and others worked on this issue. A full sworn inquiry cannot take place without having some basic documents or facts to work from. The commission of inquiry is thoroughly examining whether such a position can be reached, as we hope that it can. Judge Barron is continuing the excellent work of Judge Hamilton, who spent nine months working extremely hard on this. It is not an easy task. We shall wait for the report. If no facts can be obtained, a sworn tribunal in such circumstances will not be much use. I hope we will not be in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judge Barron and his team are examining all available evidence. This is the time to bring forward any shred of information, not in a television programme following the report of the inquiry. Long years of suffering have passed for the families of the victims. It is not a very long time ago, however, in terms of people's memories and the knowledge they may have retained. It is possible <Col N="449" /> that people who have retired, who could not speak before, can speak now. We urge such people to help Judge Barron and his team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What about people who will not co-operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both republicans and the British Army should co-operate. Successive Governments fought hard for this enormously costly inquiry so these issues do not go on forever. Issues regarding Bloody Sunday are deeply felt by the community. People should co-operate to enable the inquiry to do its job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the need for people to come forward to give information, the Taoiseach will be aware that the Saville inquiry has given anonymity to certain witnesses. As a result, more people have offered to give evidence. Has the Barron inquiry considered allowing persons to give evidence anonymously, or has it offered anonymity to any person in return for evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Judge Barron has not given me an up to date, day by day account, so I do not know the answer to that question. From inquiries in Northern Ireland, I am sure that if people were prepared to help, Justice Barron or any of the inquiry team would be glad to talk about those issues. It is important these people get to the truth, and every consideration will be given to them, but I would not expect Justice Barron to raise that issue with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the Taoiseach been drawn to a statement made in the Northern Ireland Assembly by a leading member of Sinn Féin that there is evidence of collusion between the British Government, loyalist paramilitaries and the Irish Government in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Would the Taoiseach like to comment on that allegation and will he bring those remarks to the attention of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume they are the remarks made during the Northern Ireland Assembly debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the full text of that debate. There were allegations of collusion involving the Garda, the Irish Government and many others in the course of that debate but no credence could be given to any of it. When members of the SDLP sought an amendment and asked people to substantiate any of the issues raised, not one iota of evidence was produced that could be construed as something to follow. The contents of that fairly lengthy debate have been made available and I am sure they will be looked at by Justice Barron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>From his reading of the report of <Col N="450" /> the debates, would the Taoiseach agree that this was a very specific allegation made by a leading Sinn Féin member who said there was evidence of it? Will the Taoiseach ensure that no stone is left unturned, no file or trail left unexamined, to ensure there is a full investigation into these extremely serious allegations? It is also important that the gentleman who made the allegations be asked to supply the necessary evidence to the Commission and that a demand is made that he put his money where his mouth is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of the allegations made during the debate should be looked at. People from any side of the debate with evidence that would be helpful to Justice Barron's commission of inquiry should bring that evidence forward. The text of that debate will be made available to Justice Barron. I would not agree with Deputy Currie that people have made very specific&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>He said there was evidence of collusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just about everybody in that debate said there was evidence of collusion on one side or another but nothing specific was said. When they were challenged by SDLP colleagues to produce facts in the debate, nobody did, unfortunately. I am not responsible for the investigation. It is for Justice Barron and his colleagues to try to find any shred of information they can to get to the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The author of the victims commission, Mr. Wilson, thought it worth pointing out that many believe Garda investigations into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings were stymied for political reasons. It is believed that the Administration here did not want to embarrass the British Government in case there was collusion, or perhaps they knew of collusion. Will former Taoisigh and former Ministers for Justice be called to give evidence to the commission? Does the Taoiseach think they should be called and will he call on them to come forward to give any information they have to the commission? Are there Cabinet documents or minutes that might throw light on a matter which causes unease among people here, and will they, or should they, be made available to the Commission as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All Government papers, all documents in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all the papers within the Garda will be looked at and examined. I know the point that Deputy Higgins has made. I raised it in this House many years ago as a question, just as he is asking a question now. The question is how so many people could be killed in horrendous and barbaric acts of terrorism on one day on 17 May 1974 and the inquiry be wrapped up, while the people went back to their various bases in 1976. That is what the Deputy is saying. That <Col N="451" /> is one of the reasons we have agreed that these matters be looked at. I do not know any of the answers and any papers that are there on this matter can be looked at.</P>
      <P>Looking back at it now, 25 years later, it appears strange. There were difficult times and difficult events and in 1975 there were more bombings. The Dundalk bombing occurred on 19 September 1975 and then there were other acts in 1976, a very difficult year. There was the killing of the British ambassador here and all the other events. It is not that there was nothing going on but the people who were involved with this were experiencing a huge threat to the State. I am not here to justify these matters. I know what people have said to me and what people continually say.</P>
      <P>Judge Barron is an eminent person and it is for him to seek whatever co-operation he requires in this regard. Don Mullan's book contains an enormous amount of the detail on this, as well as other books, articles and television programmes, all of which have been examined and are being followed through by Judge Barron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach awaiting the outcome of the Barron inquiry before implementing the recommendations of John Wilson's Victims Commission which were published in July 1999 in so far as they relate to the relatives and victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? The relatives are concerned that a number of the recommendations have not been implemented in relation to anyone, but particularly in relation to those victims and relatives of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for my part &ndash; they are not related. The implementation of that report is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As far as I am concerned, Judge Barron's work is not holding up any of that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will probably agree there is probably evidence that, if it were available, would be helpful to the inquiry but that evidence may be outside the jurisdiction. What is the situation in relation to such evidence? Have there been any discussions at a political level in particular with the UK in relation to making such evidence available to the inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no wiser than the Deputy, but I have never met a person who believes all the information on this is available within the <Col N="452" /> jurisdiction. Everybody I have ever met concerning this issue over the decades believes some information is outside the jurisdiction. All we can do is ask for assistance from the British Government, particularly the Northern Ireland Office and the Secretary of State. That has been done and to the best of my knowledge some of the data has been made available. All of the reports indicate that most of the data was in Northern Ireland. However, I do not know whether that data will be made available or whether it exists in the first place.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the Sports Campus Ireland project has been transferred to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. An allocation of £10 million was included in my Department's Estimate for 2000 to facilitate the start-up of the project. Now that the project is off the ground, responsibility for taking it forward has been given to the responsible line Department.</P>

Does he further accept that he is identified with it in the public mind and also in the mind of bodies such as the FAI whose deputation wishes to meet the Taoiseach and not the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid? In a project of such national importance, does the Taoiseach not accept that he should retain responsibility for something he initiated?</P>
      <P>Why, on 30 and 31 January, did the Taoiseach seek to have questions on this subject addressed to him on the Order Paper transferred to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Why is the Taoiseach abandoning this child? Why will he not take responsibility for his progeny?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If my memory is correct we debated this issue in the House a fortnight ago but I do not know if the debate was based on the questions to which the Deputy referred or other <Col N="453" /> questions. Over the years the Department of the Taoiseach has been involved in feasibility studies and the early examination of the setting up of numerous projects, following which the projects move on. Deputy Quinn will be familiar with the Department's work on the IFSC. The same was the case with Temple Bar and several other projects and programmes. This does not mean the Taoiseach of the day loses interest in this or many other projects.</P>
      <P>Under the national plan we are spending £41 billion and I deal with the NRA and other projects. However, it would be impossible for me to follow day-to-day progress. On this and other projects, I do my utmost to meet as many groups as possible. In the case of Sports Campus Ireland, I met all the major national bodies and many of the smaller bodies. I met the schoolboy leagues, the AUL, the United Churches league and several other bodies and I will continue to do so. I also met the National Community Games. However, it is unrealistic to expect the Taoiseach to be involved on a day-to-day basis with all the projects which require hands on management, boards, chief executives and many staff.</P>
      <P>I was involved at the initial stages of Sports Campus Ireland through the feasibility study, the master plan, the early work on the aquatic leisure centre and the design phase. The Minister will shortly announce the framework plan and I am sure the project will proceed with my support and assistance whenever necessary.</P>

If the Taoiseach accepts that and that it is not a <Col N="454" /> fit and well running child capable of being run as a line Department project, his abandonment of direct responsibility for answering questions in this House is extraordinary. His colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, does not know what is going on. Does the Taoiseach agree that the people involved in this project are the former Secretary-General of the Department, an eminent former civil servant and a senior civil servant who has been seconded from his Department and is still on the payroll of the Department of the Taoiseach? </P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is extremely competent and well briefed on this issue. I have heard him dealing with it at numerous meetings and presentations and in this House. He knows more about the details than I do. The PricewaterhouseCooper feasibility study, which was carried out some time ago, set out the price structure. It is a campus development. I hope Deputy Quinn does not fall into the same trap as those people who believe that the stadium is the only development. It is a 600 acre development.</P>
      <P>The architectural and environmental framework plan is finished and that will show a logical and coherent approach to the development of Sports Campus Ireland and all the facilities. There was an enormous response from international and national architectural firms to the competition which was conducted under the auspices of the RIAI. I was involved throughout that process. The winner of the competition will be announced shortly. It will show the campus and the entire layout of the facilities. The transport work has been completed. A small group of people is now working on how that will fit in with future plans. The proposal for the aquatic and leisure centre, which needed to be finalised, was cleared up before Christmas. It must be ready by December 2002 in preparation for the Special Olympics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have taken place with all the major national sporting bodies. The board is up and running and its staff is fully in place. There are ongoing consultations with local public representatives and local community representatives. It <Col N="455" /> does not need the Taoiseach of the day to hold its hand on an ongoing basis. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, who is as keen a sports person as I am, can now do it and he will have more time.</P>

      <P>Is it the case that as soon as the Taoiseach had milked this project for all it was worth, including photocalls, meetings and high profile work, he quickly passed the dirty ball across to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation so he could take the flack when clients decided they would not use the new stadium? Will the Taoiseach or the Minister be in the photocall when the winner of this competition is announced? I strongly suspect the Taoiseach will be there taking the glory for that. Will he tell the House who is responsible for dealing with the Costello report, published last week, in which there was severe criticism of the Government about the lack of sporting facilities throughout the country and the over-emphasis on one single capital project as opposed to supplying sporting and recreation facilities all around the country? I suppose the hapless Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will have to deal with the outcome of the Costello report. The Taoiseach will certainly not touch it.</P>
      <P>What exactly is the role of the principal officer in the Department of the Taoiseach who has been sent to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Is it just to keep the Taoiseach informed when there might be a good photo opportunity or when something nice is coming up on this project? What exactly is his role, seeing as he is still attached to, and being paid by, the Taoiseach's Department?</P>

Whether it is in Limerick, Cork, Dublin, Waterford or elsewhere, at last we are seeing real sports facilities. Unlike what we were doing a few years ago, 680 projects are now being funded all over the country, from scouts' dens to big football projects. Thankfully we have done that. Apart from the fact that the Deputy has to take a political line, I would think that, in her heart, she would be glad to see over 100 acres of parkland and 500 acres of development taking place in an area not too far from her own. That is something that will be truly worthwhile. My only hope is that I will live to see it all being completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on assuming his new position as Deputy Leader of Fine Gael. He is a constituency colleague and I wish him well. I assure Deputy Mitchell that I am 100% with this project. Planning permission for the first part of it has been in since 22 December and the architectural plan has been completed. Other aspects of it are moving forward and all the consultation has taken place. Wherever I can be useful, I will of course support it. The cost of the stadium, as outlined in the original PricewaterhouseCoopers' feasibility study, was and remains £230 million. The study also gave an initial guideline cost of £51 million for a campus of sporting excellence.</P>
      <P>On the basis of further work that was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the professional estimate for the commercial facilities planned, the stadium company estimates the cost of the campus, excluding the stadium, at £320 million. This gives a total cost of £550 million. Because the project is being put to the market on a public/private partnership basis &ndash; the commercial aspects of this were advertised in the paper a week or two ago &ndash; the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for commercial facilities. So when the private donation of £50 million from J.P. McManus is taken into account, the latest cost to the Exchequer of Sports Campus Ireland, including the stadium, will be £350 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the costs. Deputy Mitchell will be aware that practically every project, including roadway projects, in which we are now involved has not come in under tender because of the escalation in wages and the upturn in the economy over the last few years. All these factors are contributing to escalating costs. I have given the Deputy the figures on this project until it goes out to tender. All the elements will not go out to tender in one go but as they go out, we will see what the costs are. As I understand it, the tender costs in regard to the aquatic centre were quite attractive because there was big international competition. On the international dimension to this, I think 11 of the top 14 companies in the world have shown an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Taoiseach, which he did not answer, was, regardless of the cost, is he going ahead with this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the costs that are there, I am going ahead with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>So that means there is a question about the Taoiseach's commitment to this project if the costs continue to escalate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs will continue to escalate over time. This will be done on a phased basis. In regard to the PricewaterhouseCoopers work, which was done in 1999 and reported at the end of 1999 to early 2000, those are the costs I have given. Elements of this will not happen for some time. It is unlikely that the costs then will be less than what they were in 1999. Could the Deputy, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, give me an example of where that has happened? I do not think that has ever happened in a project involving costs and services. These are the costs unless they escalate out of control, and I do not think there is any reason they should. The feasibility work was done on a good basis and I hope good design will be used and good international companies. I hope we will get competitive tendering. I see no reason, therefore, that we should consider not completing every aspect of this within a five or six year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach put on record the other costs associated with this project, including the cost of moving the State Laboratory and the State farm?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have those costs but I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources have put those <Col N="458" /> costs on the record so they are in the public domain. In some of these instances, while they are added on or, at least, put down as extra costs, it is a good idea for these companies to move, particularly for the Agricultural Institute to use up very valuable land and good resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past year, Aer Lingus management has been negotiating with all sections of the workforce, either through direct talks or using the State industrial relations mechanisms in relation to claims on pay, pensions and working conditions.</P>
      <P>A number of these claims involving clericals, operatives, including baggage handlers, catering staff and cleaning staff, pilots and cabin crew have given rise to disputes which resulted in industrial action being taken. The industrial action has varied from two hour stoppages by certain sections to the 24 hour stoppages on 17 October 2000 and 7 February 2001 which led to the suspension of Aer Lingus services. Aer Lingus has estimated that a total of 3,810 man days &ndash; I suppose that should be person days &ndash; have been lost due to these various stoppages.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in relation to a number of these disputes as follows. Clerical staff accepted a Labour Court recommendation in November 2000 and the proposals are being implemented by Aer Lingus. A Labour Court recommendation on a general claim by the operatives group &ndash; catering staff, baggage handlers and cleaning staff &ndash; was accepted on 14 December 2000.</P>
      <P>On that date, baggage handlers also accepted a package put forward by the company in response to a local claim. Local talks on flexibility are continuing with catering and cleaning staff. In relation to the pilots, direct talks with the company are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the 24-hour stoppage on Wednesday last, 7 February, related to cabin crew represented by IMPACT who had rejected the Labour Court recommendation. Representatives of the National Implementation Body established under the renewed terms of the PPF met that evening with representatives of IMPACT. They conveyed their concern at the implications <Col N="459" /> of the industrial action in Aer Lingus and the reported plans for further action in the context of the commitment to industrial peace and stability in the PPF.</P>
    <P>Following a request from the implementation body, both Aer Lingus and the union agreed to return to the Labour Court. The Labour Court was requested to facilitate them in reaching agreement on as many items as possible in direct discussion, and to make a recommendation on those issues on which agreement is not reached. A meeting of the parties was convened on Thursday, 8 February 2000 and I understand talks are continuing and are taking place at present. Following rejection of the Labour Court recommendation by cabin crew staff of SIPTU, that union is also now involved in the latest Labour Court initiative.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree, despite the settlements in relation to certain elements within Aer Lingus that the current situation is totally untenable, that what we are witnessing here is the national air carrier self-destructing and that we cannot have a situation where flights will be delayed and cancelled and 18,000 to 20,000 passengers abandoned, at a loss of £2 million per day every time this happens? The company and the unions need to get their act together to try to resolve the matter once and for all.</P>

I thank them for that as well. I genuinely mean that. It meant a great deal to me. I read the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; and they gave me solace.</P>

    <P>With regard to what the Deputy said, I note from the background notes what was going on last week as I did not follow it that much. The <Col N="460" /> National Implementation Body has also requested IBEC and ICTU to assist the parties and has requested the parties to refrain from public comment pending resolution of the dispute. I want to obey that request if I can, but yet we are in Dáil Éireann and obviously questions must be answered. I am very much aware of and regret the effects of these disputes on Aer Lingus customers and on the tourism and business sectors in the economy. I urge all parties in dispute to continue the talks with a view to reaching a solution. It is a serious matter that the national airline carrier has reached the state it is now in. I hope the good will that appears to permeate the talks will continue to the benefit of all in the process.</P>

        <b>:</b> At this juncture and given the sequence of industrial actions which have disrupted the company and its operations, does the Minister see any prospect in the foreseeable future of the flotation of Aer Lingus? The Bill has gone through the Seanad but has been put on hold because of the current situation. While there is an implementation body in existence the Minister put in place the three wise men to examine the Iarnród Éireann operation. Thankfully there is peace and tranquillity <i>pro tem</i>, at least. Would the Minister consider the prospect of such an intervention being useful in the case of Aer Lingus to see whether they can pull the different factions together and introduce some kind of a formula or prescription to ensure the carrier can continue to provide the service to which the general public is entitled and which it has received in the past but, unfortunately, has been so badly derailed in recent months?</P>

      <P>Policy in relation to State enterprises is set out clearly in the Programme for Government. This provides that the Government, working within the framework of a social partnership approach, will ensure that State companies are equipped to meet the challenges of the developing competitive global market place. Decisions on ownership of State companies are <Col N="461" /> based on a case-by-case consideration of the circumstances of the companies and a determination which best meets the interests of all the stake holders involved. In that regard, the views of the boards are relevant.</P>
      <P>In the light of the emergence of competition I considered it important for the ESB to turn its attention to finding the best way to position the company to be successful in the future liberalised environment for electricity.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Chairman of ESB and invited the board to let me have its views on the future direction of the ESB including such issues as alliances, strategic partnerships, structure and ownership. I also encouraged the board and the ESB group of unions to discuss this matter together. There were several meetings and all aspects and options were fully explored and examined. The board of the ESB finalised its position last month.</P>
      <P>The board concluded, having taken full account of the submissions from the ESB management and unions that the essential conditions for a successful change of ownership do not prevail at this time. Therefore the board decided it would be inappropriate to proceed with a change of ownership recommendation. The board also decided to urgently pursue with the ESB group of unions, in a spirit of partnership, the development of a comprehensive strategy for the future development and growth of the ESB.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts taken to date by the board, the management and unions in relation to this important issue. I respect the conclusion arrived at by the board. I am confident that all parties will work together in a spirit of openness and partnership to develop this partnership strategy.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that in November 2000 she issued a statement saying the part privatisation of the ESB was desirable and on 17 January 2001 she made a statement saying the board of the ESB was the best judge of what should happen. Will the Minister agree it is vitally important that the shareholder, namely herself and the Government, being the owners of the company, make the decision. While the advice and opinion of the board and management of ESB might be sought, will she agree that the decision and the policy on the ownership of the ESB should be a primary matter for the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement arose out of a radio interview on the Sunday and naturally the newspapers picked up on it. The ESB would be best served by such a partial privatisation. I respect the decision of the board when it said that, as of now, it did not see privatisation as the way forward. The Deputy is correct in saying it is <Col N="462" /> the stake holder that is the Government of the day, who will have the final say on this.</P>

Will she look again at the policy of part privatisation, which in all other cases has led to full privatisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While it had a strategic partner, Telecom Éireann was fully privatised. I remain of the view that partial privatisation is the best route but I respect that the board has taken a decision, which it has conveyed to me. In explaining it the words &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; have been used. Therefore, I expect the issue will arise again and in that context I will be open to whatever the company has to say.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the announcement of the proposed acquisition of the Tosco Corporation by Phillips Petroleum was very recent, and the full implications are still being considered by my Department. Phillips Petroleum is aware that the Tosco Corporation is at an advanced stage in negotiating for the purchase of the business and assets of the INPC and, in public statements, has indicated that it envisages that the deal will proceed. Meanwhile, talks are continuing between the INPC and the Tosco Corporation with a view to bringing that deal to conclusion.

Thankfully, the INPC provided the Opposition spokespersons with briefings on this. I understand that three weeks ago the deal was finalised, the Tosco Corporation was the purchaser in a $100 million take over which included a 15 year guarantee and talk of the full employment of existing employees. All the elements of the deal were in place and it was only a matter of rubber stamping it and introducing the relevant legislation to the House.

I had three main issues when this development began last August. The first related to environmental concerns which had been in the main resolved between the INPC, the Department and Tosco. The second issue, which related to continuity of employment, was envisaged as one of the main points in the agreement. The third issue related to the meeting with the unions, listening to what they had to say and <i>vice versa</i>. The management of the INPC have very much engaged with the union members. As far as I am aware, the Department did not have discussions with Phillips, but I would enter the caveat that perhaps someone talked to someone on the phone in the past week or so when I was not available.

      <P>The cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships has prepared detailed proposals for changes in the institutional arrangements relating to land use and transport in the greater Dublin area. In particular, the team has considered how better co-ordination can be achieved in relation to strategic land use planning, transportation planning and the regulation of public transport. These proposals have been considered by the Cabinet committee and will be brought to Government shortly. Subject to Government approval, it is proposed to publish these proposals in a consultation paper and to seek comment from interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> It is envisaged that the Railway Procurement Agency will have a clearly focused role in ensuring the timely delivery of appropriate rail infrastructure and services. While most of the work of the Railway Procurement Agency is likely to be focused on the greater Dublin area, it will have a national mandate and will be a procurement rather than a regulatory body. It will be expected to operate within a regulatory framework set by the body exercising regulatory functions. This will be addressed in greater detail in the proposed consultation paper.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with my colleagues in expressing sympathy to the Minister. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so, although I am aware she was in her office and at her desk early last week. I want to say how much I admire her courage and commitment in returning so quickly to work. I welcome her back to the Chamber.</P>
      <P>On the institutional arrangement for transport, it is now universally recognised that the fact that more than two dozen bodies are responsible for transport in Dublin is probably the single biggest cause of the traffic problems in the city. It is recognised that the dispersal of responsibilities does not just result in a lack of co-ordination but causes failure in the delivery of services because it has been too easy for agencies to pass the buck to one another. As everyone knows, when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible and, against that background, it seems folly to proceed with the setting up of further agencies without attempting to pull all the existing agencies together. I can understand the need for a regulatory and procurement function but surely it is necessary to put a single body in place to deal with all these functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in relation to the regulatory body and the procurement function, which is a mechanical aspect. The point about the multiplicity of agencies is no longer relevant because people want an agency which will deliver proper land and transport planning. The Cabinet infrastructural committee considered the issue last Thursday and when the consultation paper emerges, there will be much greater clarity on the matter. The Deputy's points are well made and proper to the debate. I hope the input from people into the consultation document will lead to a proper body taking the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that while her statements, including those of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Taoiseach, point to a single transport authority with a land use dimension, decisions are being made that directly contradict that objective and we are actually adding to the number of agencies that already exist. These include the Rail Procurement Agency, which is to be set up soon, the regulator body for buses, the shadow regulat<Col N="467" /> ory body for buses, the unit being set up in the Minister's Department and the innumerable consultancies that have been commissioned. This problem does not just relate to the Minister's Department but to other Departments with a transport remit. The partnership forum and the Dáil committee are carrying out studies. Is there a danger that the Minister and the Government are losing sight of the wood for the trees? Will she accept that the overriding imperative is to have a single transport body which can get a handle on all the issues for which agencies already exist? The view in Government and among the public seems to be that the Dublin traffic problem cannot get any worse. I believe it can get much worse unless a single body takes a handle on the matter. Will the Minister accept that the fact that no one in Government and no agency is performing the single function of regulating traffic is at the root of our problems and that the problems will get worse if we keep ignoring this fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what we are doing. The land use and transport body would act both as transport authority and public transport regulatory body for the greater Dublin area. The Cabinet is due to take the decision on that shortly and the consultation paper will be released. The partnership forum in the Department, which involves management, unions and the Department, is a separate body. It was set up under the PPF and is performing a good function. I do not envisage it being in any way disruptive of traffic; the reverse is true.</P>

      <P>I have not received correspondence from the office of EU Competition Commissioner, Mr. Mario Monti, confirming that an ESB subsidiary had violated European law by securing a connection to the national grid. I received a letter, dated 22 December 2000, from Mr. Monti in relation to the liberalisation of the Irish electricity sector. That letter, together with my reply dated 17 January 2001, have been publicly available on my Department's website since 18 January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues discussed in Mr. Monti's letter was the impact of limited grid capacity for new connections. He referred to the fact that, under current arrangements, newcomers have to wait <Col N="468" /> until the system reinforcements are in place. In this context, Mr. Monti stated that the grant of a grid connection for the Synergen power plant, in which ESB is a partner, had the effect that certain competitors, other than Viridian, would be unable to obtain firm grid connections in the medium term. Mr. Monti also noted that the Commission for Electricity Regulation &ndash; CER &ndash; was engaged in public consultation with a view to introducing a new procedure for grid connection. He welcomed this as a step in the right direction and asked to be informed about the decision of the CER in due course.</P>
    <P>In my reply, I informed Mr. Monti of the measures I have taken to liberalise the market and assured him that my goal has been to facilitate and stimulate properly regulated and fair competition for the benefit of all consumers. I recalled that the CER has responsibility for regulating terms for connection to and use of the transmission and distribution systems. I indicated that, in the interests of security of supply and the promotion of competition, I had immediately requested the CER to examine and implement as a matter of urgency, in conjunction with national grid, the measures that need to be taken to resolve this matter quickly. I added that I considered the recent draft direction issued by the CER to be a positive step forward and that I would certainly be happy to inform Mr. Monti about the decision taken by the CER in due course.</P>

      <P>I will answer the second question first. I am satisfied.

One does not move from a monopoly to an opening up of the market in a measured, even way; that is not the way the world operates. However, I am satisfied that liberalisation is happening.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether the ESB's involvement with Synergen broke an EU regulation. The Attorney General advised me about 15 months ago that I would have to state publicly, through newspapers and at meetings, that if the EU came to the conclusion that the arrangement was uncompetitive or breached European competition rules, I should inform the ESB of that fact. I would have to inform the ESB that if that was the case, it would have to divest itself of that interest. I duly informed the ESB of that, both by letter and during a meeting with the chairman. He convened a meeting of the ESB board, read my letter to it and explained the situation. The ESB is aware of the situation.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that Iarnród Éireann is not providing full and timely information to the Railway Inspectorate of my Department in relation to safety aspects of the company's operations. A lack of adequate responses to correspondence from the Railway Inspectorate inhibits the ability of the inspectorate to effectively carry out its duties. I regard this as totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation, dating from the 19th century, is inadequate in relation to the legal obligations of the company to provide information. This was cited, apparently, as the reason it did not have to give it. However, the matter was raised with the managing director of Iarnród Éireann by letter in May 2000 and it was pointed out to him that there is no legal obstacle to prevent the company from co-operating with the Railway Inspectorate in an informal way, pending the enactment of the proposed railway safety legislation. The managing director was also advised that it was unacceptable for Iarnród Éireann to decide if and when inquiries from the Railway Inspectorate should be replied to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the situation has now improved, in particular in relation to information on new works and that regular meetings to facilitate the flow of information are now in place between the company and the Railway Inspectorate. However, the situation regarding operational <Col N="470" /> matters, including information in relation to accidents, remains unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>My Department recently instructed Iarnród Éireann to provide all the information requested by the Railway Inspectorate as a matter of priority and in accordance with a strict timetable. I expect the company to comply with this requirement. Under the proposed Railway Safety Bill, I will establish a new railway safety authority with wide-ranging powers of inspection and enforcement. I will provide the railway safety authority with powers to require such information or records from railway undertakings as may be needed by the railway safety authority for the purposes of carrying out its functions.</P>

Public safety is a matter of public concern and there should be no hiding behind confidential information.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister further remind the company that, at this juncture, it is particularly susceptible to public criticism by virtue of the fact that a sub-committee of the House is currently minutely examining the company's performance in relation to the mini CTC contract, in which 28 stations have still not been connected, whose projected cost of £15 million will now be a minimum of £42 million and where there are major questions to be answered in relation to the manner in which the company carried out its duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal by Premier Transmission to build a pipeline from Belfast to Dublin. The proposal was promoted by Premier on the basis that it would be able to get one or two new power stations in the Dublin area to sign contracts with it for gas supply. While Premier Transmission made very positive public statements during the early part of last year about its expectation of being able to attract customers for its proposal, the economics of the proposal have <Col N="472" /> not been advised to me, nor has a formal application for consent for the construction of the southern portion of such a pipeline been made.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Premier that its proposal with regard to a North-South pipeline would not be developed with the introduction of a public service levy and I am not aware of any change in its position on the question of a levy. I want to emphasise that the proposal for a levy is to support the concept of postalised transmission tariffs which is objectively justifiable and is neutral in regard to its impact on competing new gas import projects. At this stage, I am not aware of any further developments in relation to Premier's North to South pipeline nor can I say if it has accepted the argument for a public service levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Minister's policy of postalisation and concur that there is a public service obligation to fund it. Does the Minister of State agree that the former British gas company, Premier Transmission, together with Keyspan, a syndicate of an American and former British company which was privatised, is really seeking a free ride without meeting any public service obligations? Does he agree the company is seeking to dump its surplus gas supply from the pipeline built between Scotland and Belfast into the Republic? I strongly urge the Minister to reject any such attempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's support in regard to the principle of postalisation. Efficient implementation of postalised gas transmission tariffs may require a transparent intervention mechanism such as a levy. From a State aid point of view, any such proposal would require EU clearance. It would also necessitate primary legislation and independent operation. It is proposed to ask the Commission for Electricity Regulation, when it is empowered to deal with gas related matters, to advise on the least costly intervention mechanism. The legislation required to confer such powers will be introduced in the near future. The commission will also be charged with the implementation of the eventual regime.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that in May 1998 the German Government suspended all shipments of spent fuel from Germany to both Sellafield and La Hague in France following the discovery that the outsides of the Castor containers in which the fuel was transported were contaminated. As I understand it, shipments have not resumed since. However, I understand that BNFL has recently been granted a permit by the German authorities for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel from a German nuclear power plant to Sellafield for reprocessing.</P>

I will make a decision on the appropriate action to be undertaken when I receive the results of my inquiries.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 58, 86, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I have raised with Iarnród Éireann concerns expressed to me regarding travel difficulties for passengers at peak times on the DART. The company has informed me that there are capacity constraints in relation to the frequency of trains which can safely use the rail track network on the northern suburban line into the city centre. The maximum safety limit on the line is 12 trains per track per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann commissioned an additional ten DART carriages towards the end of last year as a result of which some DART trains have been increased from four to six carriages. This position <Col N="475" /> will improve at the end of April when a further 16 new DART carriages will come into operation. In the meantime, additional drivers will be recruited and trained and this will enhance reliability. In all, there will be an increase of almost 30% in DART capacity compared with November last.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to cater for general growth in demand for DART and other rail services on the northern line over the coming years, the national development plan provides for more new DART carriages, 80 new diesel rail cars, all DART station platforms are being lengthened; and plans are at an advanced stage in Iarnród Éireann for a major investment project to increase the frequency and capacity of trains on the northern suburban rail network by providing enhanced signalling.</P>
    <P>I have asked Iarnród Éireann to accelerate the submission to me of its proposals for the upgrade of services on the northern suburban line.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Three additional quality bus corridors on the north side of Dublin will be implemented during 2001 in addition to the Finglas and Malahide Road QBCs which are already in operation. The three additional QBCs are Blanchardstown and Swords, which are expected to be launched in April-May, and Ballymun at a later date.</P>
    <P>In addition to these projects, Bus Átha Cliath has also informed me that the company will continue to monitor and upgrade existing services as necessary and indeed has definitive plans in place to increase capacity and upgrade bus services on a number of routes serving the northside over the next couple of months. These changes will increase both the capacity and cross-city services for customers.</P>
    <P>A proposal for an underground rail interconnector linking Heuston Station to East Wall junction, which is in the vicinity of Clontarf Station <i>via</i> Pearse Station and the Docklands, has been incorporated in the Dublin Transportation Office's Strategy 2000-16 &ndash; A Platform for Change. The Dublin Transportation Office is currently preparing an implementation plan for the strategy. The DTO has set out a target of early March for the completion of this work, which will then be the basis for Government decisions on the projects, including the interconnector link, to be brought forward under the strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be here today to answer the Deputies' questions as well as respond to the comments of other Opposition Deputies regarding yesterday's events.</P>
      <P>I want to record the Government's achievements with regard to the economic and budgetary management of Ireland's economy over the past four years. In so doing, I want to respond to the criticisms which in my view have been unfairly levelled against the Irish economy and the Government's management of it.</P>
      <P>In particular, in responding to the Deputies' questions I want to address three issues central to this debate. First, I will contextualise the events of recent weeks by setting out briefly the process of European economic policy co-ordination, a process which is central to yesterday's events. Second, I will address the key issues raised by the European Commission in its assessment of last December's budget, and set out the Government's response to them. Finally, I will update the House on yesterday's events at the Economic and Finance Ministers Council meeting in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of introduction, it may be useful for Deputies if I briefly touch on the process of economic policy co-ordination which is now taking place in the European Union in light of the com<Col N="477" /> pletion of economic and monetary union. A central tenet of economic and monetary union is the closer co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of member states. There are a number of elements involved in this process. Key among them are the stability and growth pact and the annual broad economic policy guidelines.</P>
    <P>The stability and growth pact is at the heart of economic policy co-ordination in the European Union. The pact requires member states in EMU to commit themselves to aim for a medium-term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus. The rationale underlining the pact is that in favourable economic times, member states should manage their budgets so as to ensure that they can, over the course of a normal economic cycle, reliably keep under the 3% ceiling on budget deficits prescribed in the treaty.</P>
    <P>The broad economic policy guidelines is the other lesser known element of the economic policy development process. The guidelines are an annual procedure carried out by the European Commission in consultation with the member states under Article 99 of the European Treaty. They essentially monitor progress and make recommendations on the direction of EU-wide and country specific macro-economic policy and on economic reform of product, capital and labour markets.</P>
    <P>The country specific guidelines, which cover each member state in turn, seek to identify economic policy priorities for the individual member state taking account of its own particular circumstances. The stability and convergence programmes are examined by the European Commission which prepares an annual assessment of them based on their adherence to the stability and growth pact, the broad economic policy guidelines as well as measures of sound economic management generally. On foot of this, the Commission prepares a recommendation for a Council opinion on each programme which is debated, changed as necessary and agreed by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, known as ECOFIN, usually during the early months of each year.</P>
    <P>Under Article 99(4) of the treaty, where it is established that the economic policies of a member state are deemed not to be consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines, the Council, acting by a qualified majority, on a recommendation from the Commission, may make the necessary recommendation to the member state. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, make that recommendation public. However, the Council has no powers to enforce this recommendation. Until now, Article 99(4) has not been invoked. That is a brief synopsis of the process in which we as a European member state within the EMU are involved.</P>
    <P>Turning to recent events, my Department received the annual assessment by the European Commission of Ireland's updated stability programme early in January. Subsequently, a draft Council opinion was prepared which proposed <Col N="478" /> issuing a recommendation under Article 99(4) of the treaty. The Government does not see that there are reasonable grounds for a recommendation in relation to the broad economic guidelines and this remains our position. I do not believe that what was done was a proportionate or even-handed response. The concerns expressed in the recommendation are based on a misreading of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Commission's assessment and the broad economic policy guidelines advises Ireland to seek to achieve economic stability. This is exactly what the Government sought to do in the budget in a number of ways by: securing the continuation of social partnership and wage moderation and avoiding a wage price spiral &ndash; this was a major factor in the Government's strategy in view of social partnership's contribution to our economic success; promoting measures to encourage increased labour supply and productivity; taking action to reduce price inflation, including indirect tax reductions so as to counter the inflationary psychology &ndash; it was important to quash inflationary expectations before they took hold; delivering the largest fiscal surplus in the European Union; reducing the debt burden to the second lowest in the Union; and using the budget surplus wisely by providing large sums &ndash; 6% of GDP &ndash; for future ageing costs.</P>
    <P>We are accused of being pro-cyclical in our budgetary policies. According to the explanatory memorandum to the recommendation, we have ignored repeated warnings from the Council and continued on an expansionary course. However, the Commission's budgetary calculations on a cyclically adjusted basis do not support this. On the Commission's figures, our fiscal stance over the past three years has been contractionary and will be contractionary again over the 2001-03 period as a whole. Therefore, we are not repeat offenders in any sense and any allegation of ignoring repeated warnings simply does not hold water. The previous Council opinions were adopted by the Council without any indication that we did not adhere to the guidelines.</P>
    <P>As regards 2001, the Commission methodology overstates the extent of fiscal loosening substantially due to once-off factors. The Commission in its report has not paid enough attention to this aspect. In particular, we are moving to a calendar tax year in 2002. This gives rise to a nine month tax year in 2001 and to some unavoidable cash flow losses to our Exchequer. However, these have a limited impact on the real economy.</P>
    <P>As I advised my colleagues at ECOFIN, I have no problem with advice to Ireland setting out the Council's view of the appropriate policy mix for the future. This should have taken the form of an opinion, as is the normal course. I remain convinced, in light of the comparative performance of the economy relative to other EU member states, that a recommendation was not warranted. This is evident from our recent economic and budgetary performance. Our growth rate at 11% is more than three times the average of the other <Col N="479" /> EU member states. We have a budget surplus of nearly 5% of GDP. Eight of the 14 other EU member states are running deficits. Our debt-GDP ratio is 39%, while most others are at 60%, and three have ratios well over 100%. Our unemployment rate is half the EU average. Tax and expenditure levels at approximately 33% of GDP are one of the lowest in the European Union. We have a binding commitment to provide 1% of GNP each year to meet future pensions and the national pensions fund is already over 6% of GNP. The rest of the European Union has shown little progress on this front. I pointed out these facts to my colleagues in a detailed table backing up these statements. Benchmarking Ireland's economic performance against other member states in this way shows how narrow the criticisms of Irish economic and budgetary policy really are.</P>
    <P>In relation to price inflation, another issue highlighted by the Commission, we acted to address this in the budget, although the increase last year was largely generated by external factors such as oil price and the euro. The latest figures show that inflation, as measured on the harmonised European basis, has fallen from 6% in November to 4.6% in December to 3.0% now. On the basis of the latest available data, this rate is lower than several other larger member states. While month-on-month changes are difficult to predict, I expect the inflation rate to decline further during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline for the Deputies the events as they took place at yesterday's meeting of European Economic and Finance Ministers in Brussels. A Council opinion on Ireland's stability programme was adopted at the meeting. As Deputies will be aware, the Council also decided to adopt a recommendation under Article 99(4) of the European Treaty. In this context, I reiterate to Deputies that the Council recommendation, as adopted by the Council yesterday, remains a recommendation only. I would also point out that, contrary to much of the media reporting yesterday, the Council did not take a vote on this issue and, therefore, it is wrong to say that the other member states voted against Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the meeting I put forward Ireland's case vigorously and argued strongly that a recommendation was not justified and that any action taken should be seen to be equitable in terms of the treatment of all member states. As to what happens next, I assure Deputies that we will continue to do business in Europe on a variety of issues in the normal way. We will continue to participate in Europe and EMU in Ireland's best interests. As has always been the case, I will listen to the views of colleagues.</P>
    <P>Above all else, the House can be assured that the Government remains fully committed to implementing its budget as set out in December for the very reasons that our policies will enable Ireland continue on a successful growth path well <Col N="480" /> into the new millennium. In short, the Government's budgetary strategy remains on course.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House believe that the Minister is more than half right in his arguments. However, it takes some arrogance and recklessness to turn an economic miracle into a diplomatic rout, as the Minister has done. The jingoism of Norman Tebbitt or the diplomacy of Margaret Thatcher are no way to deal with the European Union.</P>

      <P>The question is in the process of being put, Sir. Will the Minister agree that to disregard German, Luxembourg and French criticism in a &ldquo;that's out&rdquo; manner is no way to treat our European partners? Will he accept that the European criticism has some validity and that the Government's policies are expansionary and inflationary? While the Minister is correct in wanting to share the wealth created with the people who helped to create it, there are ways of doing it in a non-inflationary and non-expansionary way. Is he prepared to accept suggestions from this side of the House as to how to meet those two criteria?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the budgetary policy announced in December or the policies announced in the previous three years have been anything but successful in giving us our economic success. I have made it clear over the past few months since this issue came into the public domain that I do not accept the criticism of the European Commission in this regard. It is a misreading of the economy and I am supported in this by a number of commentators at home and abroad, some of whom are of the highest eminence in the economic field. I do not accept for one moment that the criticism of the European Commission, leading to the recommendation yesterday, was justified in any respect. Of course, I will listen to the views of everybody, as is well known.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that what we are seeing and what we saw yesterday is part of a pattern to distance ourselves from the European Union. His performance in recent days must be seen in the context of the big picture. I include in that picture the statement by his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, in the United States last autumn, the ongoing performance of his colleague the Tánaiste, who is hell bent on the Americanisation of the Irish social and economic fabric, and now he is unnecessarily picking a row at the highest level in Europe. I ask him to state on behalf of the Government if there is anyone responsible for the overall co-ordination of Irish foreign policy, as far as Europe is concerned. I put it to him that he obviously fails to notice, at every opportunity, that every by-pass, bridge and sewage treatment works throughout the country has been funded from the European Union. I also put it to him that his acknowledgement and the comments of the Tánaiste, that in effect he is wearing the green jersey is misplaced and instead he is burning up goodwill we have enjoyed in Europe in recent years.</P>

      <P>The suggestion by the European Commission is meant to be a statistical exer<Col N="482" /> cise, and that is what it is. The European Commission under the commissionership of Mr. Solbes does exactly that. To start to link other matters to that assessment is a total misreading and a misunderstanding of what the broad economic policy guidelines are supposed to be about. Furthermore, it shows a fair lack of knowledge of what the EMU project is about.</P>
      <P>Ireland has conducted its relationships with Europe recently and over many years in a very constructive manner under all Governments and we will continue to do so, but when the euro project was discussed and the rules were drawn up, it was clearly laid down that national budgets are the responsibility of the individual governments. It is a right each Finance Minister of the EU 15 would jealously guard. I do not think the Deputy or his party would go along with anything that would subjugate the right of the Irish people, through their elected representatives in their national Parliament and thereby through the elected Government of the day, by taking away the right to decide what was in the best interests of the Irish people in terms of welfare policies, education policies, expenditure policies and taxation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that what has been reported as the views of the European Commission, ECOFIN and the European Central <Col N="483" /> Bank are consistent with what the Irish Central Bank and many economic commentators have said, of what his Department advised him before 6 December last and with pretty well everything he said for the most of the past 20 years until he had his Pauline conversion last December.

      <P>Even the Economic and Social Research Institute calculated last December that £500 million in additional expenditure by way of taxation cuts would have an effect of only increasing inflation by 0.13% over the next three years. I do not know of any commentator who would say that a tightening of fiscal policy would do anything to reduce inflation except if one were to take a few billion pounds out of our economy. I am not talking about a few hundred million pounds or £500 million. If one took £3 billion out of the economy, that might have some effect on inflation. Would anyone in his or her sane senses suggest that we take that amount of money out of the economy, the effects of which would be dubious, as the determining factors of Irish inflation, as agreed by nearly all commentators over the past 25 years, are primarily outside our control? They are primarily the exchange rate, and recently the weakness of the euro has reflected that, and prior to its introduction the value of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies, primarily the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would have set off a wage price spiral if social partnership had broken down. In the lead up to the last budget people will be aware that social partnership was under some threat. We renegotiated an agreement, which was predicated upon a successful outcome of the budget. Members will recall in the aftermath of the budget, the social partners and, in particular, the <Col N="484" /> Irish Congress of Trade Unions, supported the budget. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions met and agreed to renew the partnership. Social partnership has been a key factor in our success over the past 13 years and most people would agree it is important to keep it on board.</P>

Why was the Minister unable to rally even a single voice in support of the Irish position. How did he come to find himself in such unsplendid isolation unable to muster support? In the past &ndash; I attended European Council meetings four or five years ago &ndash; we could rely on our neighbours in the UK to speak up for us when we found ourselves in tight corners. Yesterday, the Minister found himself totally isolated.</P>
      <P>Will he not accept that because of the way in which he handled the recommendation for reprimand &ndash; supported, as far as he was concerned but not as far as Ireland was concerned, by the Tánaiste &ndash; we have squandered our political capital and that when we really need support from Europe, for farmers in a BSE crisis or when renegotiating the Structural Funds to deal with enlargement, in the months and years ahead we will be left out in the cold?

      <P>It is one thing to say that much of Ireland's inflation is externally generated &ndash; there is consensus in the country that, by and large, that is the case &ndash; but it is something else to suggest that fiscal policy has nothing to do with the overheating which is clearly taking place in the economy. The situation of those trying to purchase a house is a clear indication of the capacity constraints we have discussed so many times before. Is the Minister saying fiscal policy has no impact on inflation, that it has no impact on domestic demand and that it has no impact on the overheating and capacity constraints prevailing? If so, he is defying all the rules of economic common sense, many of which he has preached to us for the past 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that. All matters relating to economic policy are naturally inter-related. There is no single solution that will fix a particular problem. If that were the case, every country in the world could ring a place to get the formula in order to apply it to its own economy and then they would all have the same amount of wealth. That does not happen. One must adjust one's economic policies at various times to changing circumstances but there is no set of ground rules that says one must do so in a certain way.</P>
      <P>For example, if a Member said last September that Alan Greenspan, the respected chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, would drop interest rates by 100 base points in January, he or she would have been laughed at as Mr. Greenspan was then increasing interest rates. Whatever laughs that would have got, if the Member had also said in September that Mr. Greenspan would endorse President Bush's tax cutting plans in January, advocating that as the right way to go, the Member would definitely have been taken away. Yet that is what Mr. Greenspan did in the last few weeks, which goes to prove, as Deputy Dukes and I know, there is no exact formula in economics which applies always, forever and a day.</P>
      <P>Regarding inflation, we mostly agree about the causes of Irish inflation and have in the past had good debates about it. Figures for the last two months have been very favourable regarding Irish inflation. According to the harmonised bases we were at 3.9% by end January while there are definitely two countries above that figure and one other country was above it at least for last month.

    <P>Due to the activities of some publicans, particularly in the Dublin area, I expect Irish inflation to go somewhat upwards in next month's figures but the overall trend of Irish inflation, given the <Col N="488" /> normal caveats regarding the euro, oil prices and other outside factors, should level off this year, as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I have never said that Irish economic policy and what we do here would have no effect. All these matters are interrelated but we both agree that the underlying causes of Irish inflation are in the main outside our control.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall his arrogance and stubbornness regarding an appointment to the European Investment Bank and the loss of respect for and damage to the national interest? Is he about to repeat that stubbornness? Will he not learn from his previous mistakes and agree to some accommodation of the valid criticisms of the EU being taken on board? If so, does he plan to make any changes to the budget in the forthcoming Finance Bill or will he make any changes to budgetary policy in the next budget?</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday and on many other occasions, in the run-up to every budget I take advice on board from a number of quarters &ndash; the Central Bank, commentators here, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The expenditure and taxation changes I announced in my last budget will be our programme for this year and the Finance Bill will be published on Thursday. As with every Finance Bill, there will be some additional measures but there will be no change to the broad taxation changes as announced in last December's budget regarding either taxation or expenditure policies.</P>
      <P>I do not accept for a moment that there is a link between the event last year the Deputy mentioned and the events of the past few weeks. I would have thought the Deputy would not be so anxious to raise the matter of the European Investment Bank. He has some cause himself to remember it.

Members of the previous Administration will know that we have got nothing soft from the European Commission in the past three and a half years. Nothing soft is got and the most minute change has to be notified to Europe. Deputy Quinn will have experienced that. What he rightly took for granted regarding some changes in taxation policy were not notified around 1995 as he thought there was no reason to do so. However, there was a real hullabaloo in the last two years because we did not notify <Col N="490" /> Europe and we had to engage in much renegotiation about it.</P>

Will he commit himself to removing all low paid workers, particularly those on the minimum wage, from the tax net?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if the EU is worried about tax levels, there is adequate scope to tax large companies, speculators and multinationals at rates more comparable with PAYE workers to bring in extra Exchequer resources? Does he further agree that the straitjacket which the EU is attempting to put Ireland in has been fashioned by the Government, with help from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, when they rushed this State into the Single European Act, the Amsterdam Treaty and, in particular, the Maastricht Treaty, and gave hostages to the EU bureaucracy to remove effective levers of control over the economy?</P>

It awarded us high marks for the taxation changes which it stated would boost labour supply. The Deputy will be aware that I stated in my Budget Statement in December that over this and the following budget the Government intends to remove everyone on the minimum wage from the tax net.

Even before last year I had taken out three times that figure.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to engage in an interesting discourse on EU membership with Deputy Joe Higgins. However, his views and mine do not coincide. At several conferences on Europe I have been asked the question raised by Deputy Gormley as to how matters will progress over the next decade regarding tax harmonisation and the national competencies of Governments. I find it difficult to believe that in my lifetime members states will be willing to give up the right to make their own taxation and budgetary changes. Some new mechanism might emerge but I doubt the majority of the 15 member states will agree to such a proposal. I cannot see that happening in my lifetime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Taoiseach for your good wishes. Unfortunately, I must start off as Leader of Fine Gael by being disobliging on the Order of Business. I would like to give my reasons for opposing the Order of Business. My predecessor, in accordance with a decision of the Ceann Comhairle, was enabled to raise matters of topical interest every morning on the Order of Business. The Ceann Comhairle withdrew this last week in circumstances I do not fully understand, but I will not make any allegations against him. The Taoiseach now has within his remit the authority to amend Standing Orders in accordance with motion No. 129 on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Flanagan. This proposes an amendment to Standing Orders to allow what was previously a practice at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle to be enshrined in Standing Orders so that Deputy Quinn and I would of right be able to raise topical issues each day.</P>
      <P>I am a reasonable person and I cannot see any reason Deputy John Bruton, my predecessor, could raise issues of public concern each morning yet I will be disqualified from doing so. I want to raise issues, such as the appalling health service, the lack of opportunity in education and the Government's attempt to buy the next election through corporate donations. I will oppose the Order of Business unless I get a commitment from the Taoiseach that he will accept an amendment along the lines of motion No. 129 on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Flanagan which will change Standing Orders to allow what was a privilege granted by the Ceann Comhairle to become a right for both Deputy Quinn and me.</P>

      <P>Following objections last week from the Labour Party, which were similar to those this afternoon, the Ceann Comhairle changed the decision. He suggested that we should take it up with the Dáil reform committee on which the parties in Government do not have a majority. I readily accepted that and I understand it will meet this evening. Others in the House said it should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is the ruling of the House that we should deal with it in that way. I do not have a problem discussing these and other matters in the appropriate committee and I will do so this evening.</P>

He would be well advised to consider what he is saying because he needs the co-operation of my party to conduct business in this House. There is no question of me withdrawing from the position I am now taking. I will oppose the Order of Business unless I get a commitment from the Taoiseach that his party, which does not have a majority on the committee, will support the change in Standing Orders along the lines of motion No. 129 on today's Order Paper in the name of Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether the Government is prepared to take motion No. 131 on the Order Paper, without debate? The effect of this motion would be to require the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to deal with Committee Stage of the Labour Party Private Members' Bill banning corporate donations, and to require it to complete its work by the end of this session on 12 April, so that it can be back on the floor of the House. It would have the effect of countermanding the veto the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has given to the chairperson of that committee not to discuss the Bill. I wonder if since the Taoiseach has already agreed previously that the procedure has to be taken in Government time, motion No. 131 could be taken here and agreed without debate, and that the Select Committee could be instructed to proceed with processing the legislation which has already passed Second Stage. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he is prepared to take motion No. 131, without debate, in an amended Order of Business?</P>

        <b>:</b> The Government must understand that Deputy Noonan is not speaking for the Opposition as a whole. I regret that he seeks for himself and Deputy Quinn only, the right to raise briefly matters with the Taoiseach representing the Government on the Order of Business. Deputy Noonan is Leader of the biggest party in Opposition and Deputy Quinn is leader of the second biggest, but there are other small parties &ndash; the Socialist Party, the Green Party, Sinn Féin &ndash; and Independent Deputies who cannot be silenced, squeezed out or denied the right to raise matters with the Government. I accept that we will have less time than the bigger parties which are entitled to more time, but the House is not entitled to silence us. I wish to join, however, with Deputies Noonan and Quinn in saying that the Government must give way to a new standing order that will enable matters of urgent public importance to be raised briefly on the Order of Business. That is demanded by people outside the Dáil who want to see those issues being raised with the Government and want to hear the Government's response to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach has had to leave because he has urgent business elsewhere in the building and we, obviously, accorded him that facility. May I ask a question of the Tánaiste because in the exchanges that took place there was not an opportunity for the Taoiseach to reply adequately or properly to my question. Perhaps I can put it to the other party in Government. Motion 131 on the Order Paper will have the effect of overturning the veto which has been put on this committee by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. Will she request that committee to take the next eight weeks, up to the end of this session, 12 April&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy would raise that matter under the Order of Business proper because it is an item on the Order Paper and I do not think it arises as it deals with the Revised Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree to the next item of business if we make progress on this matter. As we did in the previous matter, I would ask the Tánaiste if, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats in this Government, she is prepared to request the committee of the House to proceed with dealing with Committee Stage of the Bill in question and to report back on 12 April. Is she prepared, therefore, to take motion 131, without debate, in this House either today or tomorrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this part of the Order of Business also for the same reason. The Taoiseach who has now left the House is a greater procrastinator than Hamlet. Commitments by the Taoiseach couched in ambiguous language are no use to me. I want the change in Standing Orders to be made. I want a commitment from the Fianna Fáil Party that it will support such a change. I will not be silenced in this House and procedurally I will oppose everything until I get a commitment that the amendment is made. The Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Flanagan, will attend the meeting this evening but I would have expected a commitment from the Taoiseach not to treat all items of law reform here as a package but to deal with this as a single issue because that is the issue which concerns me now. Other issues can be decided later.</P>

On the point made by Deputy Quinn, the Government is bringing forward its own proposals in this area and it is not a matter for me or anybody else to direct a committee in relation to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: </P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,251,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 December 2001 for the payment of certain exceptional grants and for the recoupment of certain expenditure in connection with flood relief.</P>
      <P>I am glad to introduce the 2001 Estimate for Vote 44, flood relief. The total requirement for Vote 44 for the year 2001 is £2.251 million. The main element of the Vote is the provision of £2 million in the form of humanitarian aid to the victims of the severe flooding which occurred throughout the country over the period from 5 to 7 November 2000.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Government acted quickly to deal with this situation and decided on 14 November to put in place a scheme of humanitarian assistance to be administered by the Irish Red Cross Society. Under the Government decision, the Irish Red Cross was to assess the number of applicants and notify the Office of Public Works of the likely total cost of claims. On this basis, the Minister for Finance would then decide on the overall package to be made available. Six criteria formed the basis for applications and assessment under the scheme. They were death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income and/or extreme hardship. The criteria used by the society in determining eligibility for assistance was similar to previous schemes. We are talking about humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and not compensation for losses.</P>
      <P>Like the Government's quick reaction to the plight of the flood affected victims the Irish Red Cross Society was not less diligent in its rapid response to the situation which faced it. It immediately initiated an extensive advertising campaign in the national daily newspapers towards the end of November inviting applications from those who suffered severe hardship as a result of the flooding. It acted quickly to set up a special freephone telephone line and a website to help people to get help and information about the humanitarian aid scheme. This multi-media approach proved to be very successful in that almost 800 inquiries were made to the freephone number and over 200 hits were logged on the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> A special task force, consisting of both assessment and administrative personnel, was set up by the Red Cross to operate the humanitarian aid scheme in order to get aid to those in need as speedily as possible. All applications received were dealt with on a strictly confidential basis in accordance with the Red Cross fundamental principle of impartiality and its experience in disaster relief both nationally and internationally and each claim was processed and assessed individually.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross has now completed its detailed assessment of the over 400 applications received from 17 counties, across all four provinces, although predominantly from the southern, south-eastern and eastern regions, and has advised the Office of Public Works that the total estimate required for the scheme is £2.75 million. A sum of £1 million was provided to the Irish Red Cross by way of Supplementary Estimate in December 2000, thus leaving a balance of £1.75 million to be met. As I also propose to provide a contingency amount of £0.25 million to meet late claims, the total requirement for humanitarian aid in 2001 is £2 million.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation to the Irish Red Cross Society and also to thank the society on the Government's behalf for taking on this onerous task. I also commend the society on its professionalism and speed in dealing with a very difficult situation. The organisation has successfully undertaken this major domestic humanitarian project in less than two months from receipt of applications from flood victims, while continuing to maintain its other services and run two major emergency appeals for India and El Salvador during this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The second element of Vote 44 is the home relocation scheme which was set up as a once-off measure in 1995 to provide humanitarian aid for the victims of flooding throughout the country during that year. The Government provided a total of £830,000 to enable people and families whose houses had been damaged beyond the reasonable costs of repair or whose houses suffered long-term flooding to be assisted in relocating their homes. The fund is being disbursed by the Office of Public Works. As a number of cases remain to be finalised, a provision of £250,000 is sought in 2001. A sum of £250,000 was also provided in Vote 44 for 2000 in respect of certain victims of flooding in Limerick at Christmas-New Year 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the circumstances in Limerick were exceptional and were directly related to the public works associated with the main drainage scheme. They do not, therefore, set a precedent for State intervention in other circumstances in which private property is flooded as a result of rivers bursting their <Col N="514" /> banks. This scheme is also administered by the Irish Red Cross Society. The society completed its assessment of 45 claims for financial assistance in late 2000 and recommended payment, totalling £239,500, in 44 cases. Administration costs accounted for the balance of the expenditure of £250,000 in 2000. A token sum of £1,000 is being provided in 2001 in order to keep the subhead open in the event of late claims arising.</P>
    <P>While Deputies will be aware that the Office of Public Works is carrying out an ongoing programme of flood relief schemes in various parts of the country which are subject to periodic temporary flooding, it also occasionally co-operates with and provides support to local authorities in the preparation of flood alleviation proposals by the councils within their jurisdictional areas. To date, schemes have been completed at Lacken-Ardrahan, County Galway; Sixmilebridge, County Clare; Duleek, County Meath; Gort, County Galway; Cappamore, County Limerick; Newport, County Tipperary; Belclare, Tuam, County Galway; Maam Valley, County Galway; and Bridgend, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Schemes due for completion in 2001 include Dunmanway, County Cork; Freemount, County Cork; Drumcollogher, County Limerick; Belhavel, County Limerick; and Scotch Quay, Waterford. Site works are due to commence during 2001 at Kilkenny city; Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary; and Hazelhatch, County Kildare. Schemes expected to reach public exhibition stage during 2001 include Carlow town; Clonmel, County Tipperary; John's River, Waterford city; and Cregclare in south Galway. A report into the study of flooding in Ennis, County Clare, co-funded by the Office of Public Works, which was recently submitted by Clare County Council is also being considered.</P>
    <P>In addition to this ongoing programme of flood relief schemes, I wish to advise the House of the other specific steps I have taken following the severe flooding last November. In my capacity as chairman of the interdepartmental committee to monitor the effects of bad weather, I reconvened the committee which held a meeting on 24 January 2001 at which representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies were in attendance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some very useful discussions took place and further liaison was arranged on the following topics: national and non-national roads; main drainage and sewerage schemes; building on flood plains; industrial and commercial development; gathering of information during and following flood events; and flood risk mapping. I can see great potential in the area of flood risk mapping.</P>
      <P>I am aware in my capacity as Minister of State that the Office of Public Works as a drainage authority is constantly receiving reports from various sources about a variety of locations around the country which suffer localised flooding problems, with requests for flood relief schemes to alleviate those problems. Little, if any, distinction is made between the sources-causes of this flooding, be it river, road, sewage surcharge or tidal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Office of Public Works has a regionalised network of engineering offices throughout the country and is quite familiar with many flood prone areas, it does not have the resources to have a detailed knowledge of every flooding problem in the entire country. Under the aegis of the interdepartmental committee, it is intended that the Office of Public Works will begin a process of flood event mapping, which will involve as a first step the gathering of information relating to recorded instances of flooding <Col N="516" />&ndash; historical flooding data. For this purpose, it is envisaged that the involvement of local authorities, which are most familiar with flooding within each of their own jurisdictional areas, will be required. It is intended to circulate all local authorities and to request historical data about the extent and frequency of flooding in their areas with a view to compiling this information in a uniform way and publishing it.</P>
    <P>The second and more complex element will involve the flood risk mapping of the country. This is a more technical and specialist exercise requiring a multi-disciplinary approach which, while intended to introduce initially on a limited selected pilot basis, will ultimately provide a database of areas at risk from flooding.</P>
    <P>These documents will prove invaluable to local authorities when they are making planning decisions. It is essential for all future planning decisions, be they for residential or commercial developments, that local authorities take into account areas known to be at risk from flooding.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of towns and areas which were particularly badly affected by the flooding last November, my officials and I have been actively engaged in discussions with the relevant local authorities and interested parties. In the cases of Fermoy and Mallow, County Cork, and Enniscorthy, County Wexford, technical liaison committees have been established to investigate the causes of flooding with a view to developing flood alleviation proposals for these towns.</P>
    <P>In the cases of Arklow, County Wicklow, Lucan, County Dublin, and Dunboyne, County Meath, the Office of Public Works has been in contact with the respective local authorities in question and is prepared to provide whatever support is requested by the local authority in carrying out its responsibilities to relieve flooding in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that at last provision is being made for payment to be made to the people who suffered loss as a result of the flooding late last year. Many people were beginning to have doubts as to when these funds were to be made available. Despite the fact that this funding was advertised extensively, many people who would have been entitled to it under the criteria set down did not apply. I have spoken to some of those people and the reasons given for not applying were that it would have been too complicated and too cumbersome and it would probably be years before it was paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Red Cross took the <Col N="517" /> initiative and processed the applications made to it. The Minister of State indicated that 400 applications were received. I have absolute confidence in the confidentiality the Red Cross has given those applications. The criteria laid down include death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to homes, loss of income and extreme hardship, but many people who suffered extreme hardship have not applied for this funding for the reasons I outlined. That is a pity because this scheme has been quickly processed thanks to the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about loss of income but that ignores the fact that many in the farming community, outside the built up areas, have suffered severe loss and because of the useless schemes initiated through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, such as the fodder scheme, which was farcical, many people did not apply for funding in this instance.</P>
    <P>The £2.75 million will be welcomed by those who have access to it and it might give them some relief. However, it is totally inadequate as an overall response not only in terms of the damage to property but also in terms of the loss of income, particularly in southern areas.</P>
    <P>The relocation scheme is totally inadequate. I have outlined the reasons for this to the Minister on numerous occasions. People in south Galway applied for relocation under the localised scheme but they still have not been relocated despite the obvious damage to their property. Under the Department's scheme people could apply for relocation and compensation. The Minister listed a number of scheme and the timescales. If these schemes have the same timescale as the one with which I am most familiar in south Galway, it will not matter to anyone in the House when the work is done.</P>

However, the benefits have never been assessed. I do not care whether the Minister accepts my point. The reality is that the local people regard it as a success. Despite all the reports in other areas of south Galway, not even one shovelful has been taken out of any riverbed to alleviate the flooding. The Peach report was ongoing for two years, yet it was totally inadequate. There are further reports, impact studies, cost benefit analysis etc.</P>

      <P>I welcome the allocation of funding. I will endeavour to be as constructive as possible in my remarks.</P>
      <P>There have been 400 applications following the advertising campaign. However, many of the applications from people in County Wicklow and the part of County Carlow I represent were only made because the public representatives gave people the application form and told them to apply. Many of the people who were hardest hit do not necessarily read the national newspapers. I do not know whether the Red Cross was the most suitable organisation to administer the funding, but in terms of being proactive maybe the health board or local authority should have been involved in identifying the people. I gave forms to many people who did not know about the advertising campaign. This is an aspect which should be looked at in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the flood relief schemes. There are many such schemes in operation. The flood event mapping is important from the point of view of planning. The Minister referred to Arklow, County Wicklow, and said that the Department had been in contact with representatives from local authorities and was prepared to provide whatever support they require. Arklow was severely hit during the flooding and I would like to know what the Minister means by this statement. Does it mean the Department will provide funding for the employment of consultants to draw up a report and address the problems when the report is finalised? Other areas have been excluded, for example, Baltinglass. Rathvilly and Tullow and other areas along the Slaney basin. These areas were severely affected by the flooding and I would appreciate if the Minister would look favourably on applications from Wicklow <Col N="519" /> County Council for these areas. It is important that the problem is addressed so that people do not have to look for relief every year after Christmas. It may mean that some people have to be relocated or rehoused as there are certain flashpoints that suffer severe difficulty every year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the concept of the allocation of funding for schemes and consultants' reports. Did any of the people who had insurance apply for funding and, if so, did they receive payment? Some people who claimed compensation under their insurance cover may not be eligible for insurance in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the important issue of flood relief. It is important to acknowledge that rainfall levels during October, November and December were much greater on the east coast than the average. Exceptional rainfall levels were recorded for 5-7 November and 7-8 December 2000. For example, on Thursday, 2 November rainfall was 23.6mm, while on 5 November it was 41.2mm and on 6 November, 32.6mm. During the 24 hour period 7-8 December 44mm of rain fell on the east coast. These figures were recorded at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Despite these exceptionally high levels of rainfall, it is totally unacceptable that major flooding occurred and that the national infrastructure, roads and, in certain instances, railways, business and commerce, came to a standstill. The national primary roads were put out of commission and trains were held up due to flooding on the tracks. During an era of modern technology this national shutdown is intolerable and totally unacceptable and must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There was major flooding in Fingal which has approximately 1,000 kilometres of primary, secondary and minor roads. For example, the N1, the main link between Dublin and the North, was flooded at Blakes Cross, Turvey and Lissenhall and was impassable. The N2 at Coolquay was also impassable for a period. In this instance a number of houses were flooded. I have been reliably informed by the residents who were literally sandbagged into their houses for three days that no one could remember similar flooding in living memory. We must look at whether there are factors which are causing this problem. The N3 was flooded opposite the Blanchardstown Centre, while the old airport road and various properties in the vicinity were flooded. In Kinsealy property was flooded downstream of Kinsealy Church.</P>
      <P>Apart from the national primary routes, more than ten regional and minor roads were flooded, which caused them to be impassable. People in some villages and towns, such as Portmarnock, Swords, Ballyboughal, St. Margaret's, Ballealy, Lusk and other parts of north Dublin, were stranded and could not get to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

      <P>The money is not coming yet. Major problems were also recorded at our various treatment plants. Swords sewage treatment plant, which was well in excess of its capacity, could not cope with the full flow. Extensive sewer surcharge, including flooding, affected 15 properties in the area. I witnessed the aftermath of the flooding where raw sewage was strewn across front and rear gardens. That happened across the constituency. It also happened in the case of Portrane waste treatment plant and Ballyboughal waste treatment plant. All that and more occurred during this period of our Celtic tiger economy.</P>
      <P>What has happened is nothing short of a scandal. We must ask what can we do about it. I welcome this Revised Estimate of £2.75 million and appreciate the role that will be played by the Irish Red Cross Society. I do not envisage that the money that will be provided will deal with this problem. We will have to reconsider the problem and then provide the necessary finances, as substantial financial resources will have to be made available to local authorities to deal with it. I thought the Minister of State's Department would wash its hands of this problem, but the Department of the Environment and Local Government will also have a role in identifying this problem.</P>
      <P>During the earlier severe weather conditions, I spoke in the House and issued a press release to the effect that the emergency plan for the greater Dublin area should have been initiated a little sooner, at least 24 to 36 hours earlier. That matter should be examined.</P>
      <P>Snow, frost and flooding have seriously undermined our road network, particularly our regional and minor roads. Before our road network in various parts of the country collapses again &ndash; it is not so long ago since we experienced a major problem throughout the length and breadth of the country &ndash; in the context of the flooding&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Revised Estimate as I want to raise a specific issue with the Minister of State on the provision of compensation for flood relief. The <Col N="521" /> compensation under this scheme relates to the period 5 to 7 November 2000 when flooding took place. The criteria for the payment of compensation set down by the Department and the Red Cross was death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to the home, loss of income and-or extreme hardship. The case I put to the Minister of State involves four of those six specific issues, homelessness, damage to the home, loss of income and extreme hardship. I am disappointed he failed to provide a sum of money for one particular family who suffered the effect of serious flooding during the flooding of the Shannon basin in the winter of 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>The provision in this Revised Estimate is for humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and not particularly to provide compensation for losses. That family was the only family whose home was flooded on Christmas morning, yet the Taoiseach, the Minister of State's office and the Ombudsman have ignored their pleas. It has cost that family £45,000 to repair the damage to their home, which they had to leave for three months. Their daughter had to postpone her wedding and other family members had to take out credit union loans to help pay the builder for the repair work to their home. The Department, in its response to the Ombudsman, did not consider their case to be one of humanitarian assistance. That is a gross underestimation of the situation in which the couple concerned find themselves.</P>
      <P>Prior to the floods of 1999-2000, that couple raised the level of their site and house to above the record level of the flooding in 1954, the highest level recorded in the Shannon basin in or around Athlone. Subsequent to the flooding of 1999-2000, that couple again raised the floor of their home by six inches, but they cannot afford to raise the level of the site, although they intend to raise it if they can get the necessary resources to do so.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed the Government ignored requests by a small number of families and one in particular in the Shannon basin for the provision of compensation for flood relief. In 1995 when less severe flooding occurred compensation was provided. In 1996, a similar situation arose and compensation was provided. It is a gross blight on the Government that compensation was not provided in 2000.</P>
      <P>When replying, I hope the Minister of State will deal with the issue of flooding on the M4 and N4, which occurred three times during the past 12 months, and address the need for the provision of moneys to raise roads in the Shannon basin so that people can get in and out of their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight we debate a damning report from the Ombudsman on the treatment by health boards of vulnerable old people in need of nursing home care. Throughout most of the 1990s <Col N="523" /> rich and powerful people in our society evaded tax through offshore accounts and the like. The State, rather than tackle this abuse, was, in the personage of the health boards, engaged in improperly extracting money from vulnerable old people and their families. The least that elderly people should be able to expect is that, having contributed to society all their lives, they will be looked after in their old age. Indeed, the Health Act, 1990, passed by this House, seemed to guarantee them this right, yet the law was systematically flouted. Elderly people had their meagre savings taken and even recently there seemed doubt as to whether these people or their families would be compensated. There should be no doubt, this report makes truly terrible reading.</P>
      <P>The report of the ombudsman on nursing home subventions to the Dáil and Seanad states that the administration of this scheme is a cause of real concern. Among the doubtful practices identified were the making of regulations containing provisions which are likely to have been invalid,<i> ultra vires</i> the Act, including at least one instance in which the likely invalidity probably had been known in advance; the inclusion in a regulation of a provision which was almost immediately negatived by advice issued by the Department; the unreasonable prolongation of discussions with the Ombudsman's office in relation to practices which, it appears, were known from the outset to be invalid or incorrect and; the failure of some of the health boards to alter the practice even where the legal advice was that the practice was incorrect and where the Ombudsman had expressed the same opinion.</P>
      <P>The report points out that between 1987 and 1988 further rationalisation of the hospital system resulted in the closure of eight district hospitals operated by health boards and voluntary hospitals. These included Dr. Steevens and Baggot Street in Dublin, Barringtons, Limerick, and the North Infirmary, Victoria and the eye, ear and throat hospitals in Cork. Between 1980 and 1990 the total number of hospital beds fell from almost 15,000 to 12,000. The closure of district and voluntary hospitals which had traditionally catered for older people had a serious impact on the availability of extended care places for older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we should pause for a moment to consider what the moneys not paid in taxes at that time could have done for people in need of nursing home care and reflect on the famous slogan of the time &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;. In essence, the Ombudsman's report deals with the payment by health boards of subsidies to elderly persons in private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. It reports on the practice whereby the State deliberately and unlawfully took money from vulnerable elderly people who could not look after themselves or be cared for by their families and on how members of the fam<Col N="524" /> ilies of the elderly persons, once they lived within the jurisdiction of the State, were unlawfully asked to have their incomes assessed and taken into account so that the services which were provided for by law, but for which the funding was not provided, would be funded by relatives by pressure and blackmail and without any lawful basis.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 3 February last:</P>
    <P>A key part of that story is subversion &ndash; the undermining of a law passed by the Oireachtas, not by organised crime or terrorism, but from inside, by health boards and the Department of Health and Children. It reveals a Dáil so careless of its own importance that it allowed its own decisions to be sabotaged.</P>
    <P>I will return to this theme towards the end of my contribution.</P>
    <P>Under the nursing homes Act elderly people are entitled to nursing home care. The public system does not have nearly enough beds, as I have pointed out, so the Act provided for health boards to subsidise the cost of care in a private nursing home environment. It also allowed nursing home residents to have one fifth of their old age pension disregarded and not treated as means &ndash; this would be their &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo;. These two provisions were deliberately and systematically undermined by the health boards and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The report states that the 1990 Act does not make adult children legally liable for parents' hospital or nursing home costs. Despite this, the health boards refused subventions to elderly people on the grounds that their adult relatives could afford to pay the costs. This sometimes meant that the elderly husband or wife of the person in the home had to pay the full cost out of their own pensions, leaving them with little or nothing to live on. At the same time, six health boards, with the support of the Department of Health and Children, also ignored the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; provision.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Willie O'Dea, writing in <i>The Sunday Press</i> in 1993, pointed out that under the 1990 Act &ldquo;The health board is given no legal right to force a son or daughter to contribute.&rdquo;  Therefore, the Department of Health knew these actions were unlawful.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report notes the flouting of legislation in the following terms: taking shortcuts, disregarding legal advice, assuming powers which technically it did not have, resisting a growing weight of evidence and complaints that its subvention scheme was seriously flawed, the exercise of non-existent authority, the surreptitious introduction of family assessment, the disregard for clear principles of law, the sustained proffering of incorrect advice, the reluctance to acknowledge mistakes, the tardiness in the Department's dealings with the Ombudsman's office. Was there ever such an indictment by an <Col N="525" /> independent investigation of any State body or agency? The report gives precise examples. The Southern Health Board refused subvention to an elderly Alzheimer's patient because of the income of her married daughter, who had not lived with her parents for 26 years. This elderly woman, suffering from Alzheimer's, was improperly and unlawfully deprived of her just subvention. For almost five years the daughter's theoretical contribution remained the basis for the Southern Health Board's decision to refuse a subvention. The claimant's husband, who was in his eighties, pointed out to the Southern Health Board that he was paying the full nursing home costs and that this left him with less than £23 per week to live on. Regrettably, the husband died suddenly before the complaint was resolved. Ultimately the Southern Health Board accepted that its decision was not sustainable and arrears of £14,027 were eventually paid.</P>
    <P>This is not an isolated case. The Midland Health Board had a similar approach, as illustrated in extracts in the report. The Midland Health Board wrote as follows to the daughter of a subvention applicant on 9 April, 1998:</P>
    <P>. . . the Health Board are therefore now requesting you to submit details of income by way of P60, tax assessment form, farming accounts, income from investments. The Health Board must be furnished with these details to enable us to determine your liability, if any. Failure to furnish this information will mean that the application for subvention cannot be proceeded with . . .</P>
    <P>This demand was absolutely unlawful, without authority and showed no regard to the rights of a citizen. The daughter, quite rightly, responded as follows:</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that I absolutely refuse to furnish such details and demand that you assess my mother's entitlement to subvention on her own means. I feel she has been very badly treated by the Midland Health Board over the last three years in being refused what is her entitlement as a non-contributory old age pensioner with no other means of any sort.</P>
    <P>There was a lady who understood what it meant to be a citizen and understood her rights under the law and Constitution. Was there no person in the Department or the health boards who could see through the arrogance of the administration in the way these people were treated? In this case, as the Ombudsman points out, the Midland Health Board eventually agreed not to have regard to the daughter's means following the intervention of the Ombudsman, and not until then. Arrears of subvention were paid.</P>
    <P>A Christian society is judged by how it cares for its old and vulnerable citizens. This report indicates how far we have departed from that ideal given the activity of many of our health boards and our Department of Health and Children over such a prolonged period. As is clear <Col N="526" /> from page 59 of the report, the health boards knew from their own legal advisers, as the Department knew from its legal advisers and from consultations the Department had with the Attorney General's office on 3 December 1997, that these actions were <i>ultra vires </i>the 1990 Act. The Department and the health boards knew they were acting unlawfully. What penalty will they now pay for flouting the law?</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down one of his usual smart amendments to my motion but I call him to account as the constitutional political head of his Department to tell the House what penalty will now be paid by those who flouted the law and who treated vulnerable old people in this way. The Ombudsman made clear his views that general retrospection should be paid to those who have been unlawfully and improperly charged by the State and its agents. This is the least that should be done. The report states:</P>
    <P>The detailed basis for this view will be clear from this report but, in essence, retrospection should be paid because the family assessment provisions were almost certainly legally invalid; health boards generally misled families into believing that they had an obligation to contribute; health boards generally withheld the information that elderly patients are legally entitled to long-stay care from the health board and that entering a private nursing home should arise only where the patient genuinely wishes to choose private care over public care; the Department knew from the outset that the family assessment arrangements were legally invalid.</P>
    <P>The report continues by pointing out that the Attorney General's office advised the Department that there was no strict legal liability to pay arrears but, the Ombudsman's report continues:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to the Ombudsman and which is detailed in chapter seven, there is a contrary view to the position adopted by the Attorney General's Office; this casts doubt on the conclusion that there is no legal liability to pay subvention arrears.</P>
    <P>As the report was being finalised in January 2001 the Department informed the Ombudsman that it had now received the approval of the Department of Finance for the payment, by the health boards, of arrears in those cases where family assessment operated. That was January 2001, when we were running a budget surplus of approximately £5 billion and when everyone had been found out, when even the Attorney General's advice that there was no strict legal liability for arrears had been shown to be shambolic. There was and is a liability and it is only because people have been found out that the Government has now decided to pay those arrears.</P>
    <P>The details of how this will be implemented are not yet available to the Ombudsman or the House. It should be implemented fully and with interest because if wealthy taxpayers who defraud <Col N="527" /> the Exchequer are obliged to pay arrears with interest and penalties, then surely the State, with all the money it has in its coffers, must be similarly obliged to refund with interest money to those who have been defrauded by the State despite any advice to the contrary from the Attorney General or anyone else. Furthermore, any pocket money denied to elderly persons, living or deceased, should be refunded to them or to their estate in like manner. There is a moral duty to do so. The payment of arrears has in many cases been operated with a sense of <i>laissez faire</i> although £4 million was allocated to six health boards in January 1998 for this purpose. The Ombudsman stated:</P>
    <P>It appears some of the health boards failed to apply this additional funding immediately for the purpose intended. Or, at least, it appears that some of the boards felt the money was more urgently needed in other areas and &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the allocation for other purposes. From information provided by the health boards themselves, it is clear that the payment of arrears has not been treated with any great urgency and inaction or half measures appear to have been the order of the day. As of 15th January, 2001, three years after the allocation was made, three boards had not yet even calculated the amount due to deceased or discharged patients and one board had paid out only £31,000 out of an estimate of £325,000.</P>
    <P>What sort of standards are these public authorities using? This is contempt for the citizens of the State. This has been a shabby and wholly improper development. It is also one which runs counter to the spirit of public service. The report of the Ombudsman should be circulated to every State Department, local authority and State agency with the instruction that this sort of practice runs counter to what is expected of any public service in a democracy.</P>
    <P>This report goes on to quote a Fine Gael policy document on reform of this House. It quite rightly says that the right of this House to hold the State and its agencies to account has been bypassed. People are acting as if they are not only the Government but also the Legislature and have the right themselves to raise taxes. People treat this House with contempt when they are answering its questions.</P>
    <P>This is what lies at the heart of this problem. The Members of this House and the people we serve have been treated with contempt by agents of the State and by a Department which knew what was going on all along. How dare the State thieve from its most vulnerable citizens.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to withdraw his smart-alec amendment and to apologise to the House for the fact that out of a surplus of nearly £5 billion this year in the case of one health board only £31,000 out of £325,000 has been repaid. In the case of a number of others we do not even know what is <Col N="528" /> outstanding. I ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, to pay what is outstanding with full interest as is his duty.</P>

      <P>This has been a shameful period. I could list the names of several people who, because they knew that incomes of family members would be taken into account, did not apply for the nursing home subvention. The case has been strongly made for retrospective payments but there were many people who were frightened away altogether. I must say I found it extremely difficult to understand why sons and daughters who had long since left home were tracked down to discover what they earned.</P>
      <P>It was like a detective agency job. It certainly did not appear very sound to me. It is one thing for the ones who are known to get the retrospective payments. The problem of people who were frightened away in the first place is an entirely different matter.</P>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity in the short time at my disposal to discuss the crisis in the private nursing home sector. The problem is well known to this House. The subvention is a maximum of £120 per week in the Western Health Board area. A very short case history shows how very difficult it is for families to cope with that subvention. The nursing homes are in a catch-22 situation. The bill for wages has gone though the roof. Then there are insurance and crippling overheads like heating and lighting. Obviously costs are going up.</P>
      <P>Take the case of an elderly person in my parish who was paying a very low £235 per week to a private nursing home. This person had a non-contributory old age pension of £82 per week and got a £120 subvention from the health board. His family were able to pay the outstanding £33 per week, even though the family breadwinner was working on a FÁS scheme. This is the reality on the ground.</P>
      <P>A couple of weeks ago the charge of £235 was raised to £280 owing to increases in costs. Suddenly the family had to find £78 rather than £33. They just could not do it. The family of the man in need of care could not pay for the nursing home and he could not get a public geriatric home to take him as they are all full. Very few places have been created in public geriatric homes over the last few years. The ones in County Galway are outstanding, but the problem is that there are so many applicants for so few places.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the people who have been wronged in the past will be done right by in the future. There is a huge job to be done with regard to nursing homes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for raising the topic. The investigation by the Ombudsman of complaints regarding the payments of nursing home subventions by health boards has occurred as a result of the inundation of complaints from families and persons who <Col N="529" /> have been required to pay for nursing home care since the commencement of the nursing home subvention scheme in 1993.</P>
      <P>Ironically the report of the Ombudsman points out that more complaints have been received since the introduction of the scheme through the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 than were received in a similar period of time beforehand. The Ombudsman's report expresses real concern at how the nursing home subvention scheme has been administered. In fact this report is a damning one.</P>
      <P>One does not have to be in the Ombudsman's office to hear complaints or fears in relation to the subvention scheme. Only last week in my clinic I was contacted by a young lady who was frightened to face the inevitability of having to put her mother into nursing home care. She was afraid she would have to sell the family home which she jointly shares with her mother. Whether that is true or not, the fear is very real and the situation has not been clarified for so many people.</P>
      <P>The people we deal with in relation to nursing home subvention are perhaps the most vulnerable in our society. Normally they are very frail elderly people unable to look after themselves. They often do not have families who can care for them. If ever there were a group of persons who should receive the generosity of the State, particularly in a time of plenty, these are surely the people.</P>
      <P>The cost of nursing home care has been draining the savings of elderly persons and those of their families in order to keep them looked after in their most vulnerable and tender years. This has been due to a mean and tight-fisted attitude with regard to the award of subventions.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most damning reflection in this report is the financial assessment of elderly persons and their families to determine the level of subvention that persons receive. It is clear from the report that health boards under the supervision of the Minister in the Department of Health and Children have made assessments in an inconsistent, unfair and unlawful way.</P>
      <P>This has caused huge financial stress and pain to individuals and their families with sometimes tragic consequences. Deputy Gay Mitchell has spoken of some outrageous examples of families paying very large portions of their incomes to keep their loved ones in care. Some may say there is a moral obligation on family members to help finance the care of their parents. However, neither health boards nor health Ministers have the legal right to refuse to pay subvention because of a means test of family members. The legal advice cited in the report states that there is no obligation in common law on children to support their parents and that the 1990 Act does not impose such an obligation. The report goes on to state that the regulations do not impose an obligation on children of claimants to provide details of their own means as regards subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Families have been paying hefty bills with little or no financial assistance from the State which had no legal foundation for doing so. It is time the State examined compensating and reimbursing families and elderly people for the money they have spent on care which they should not have had to spend and which the State had a legal obligation to fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate concerns the repayment of more than £6 million to elderly people and their families which was taken from them illegally by the State. Millions of pounds were taken from those who could least afford it. The State took pocket money from the elderly and operated a system in an illegal manner against people in private nursing homes. This system was highlighted when the Ombudsman published his report.</P>
      <P>Health boards have given the elderly a raw deal. The Department of Health and Children did not uphold legislation passed by this House to give elderly people their rights. Even when elderly people died, health boards came after their families looking for money for the cost of care in geriatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>I will give the House an example of the kind of cases in question. I am aware of a case which involved an Alzheimer's patient being cared for in a private nursing home. Six weeks before this elderly woman died she received one week's notice from the nursing home that the fees were being increased by £20. This woman's family was on social welfare and could not afford to pay the increase. As a result, six weeks before her death this woman had to be moved to a geriatric hospital.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the health board it provided a bed for this woman. However, it is unacceptable that a nursing home can give one week's notice to an elderly patient of a £20 or £30 increase in fees. When this woman was admitted to the geriatric hospital her family was still charged. The family had a medical card and should not have been charged for the nursing home or the geriatric hospital. However, the legislation was ignored. This kind of behaviour is continuing whereby elderly people with medical cards are being charged for services which the State should legally provide.</P>
      <P>In other cases, people are being forced to travel 30 or 40 miles to a geriatric hospital because health boards are denying them nursing home subventions, even though a nursing home may be situated nearby. In some cases people are not sent to the nearest geriatric hospital because it is full so health boards are forcing people to travel 20, 30 and 40 miles to a geriatric hospital when there is a nursing home beside them. This issue was also highlighted by the Ombudsman. When the investigation took place the health board gave in. However, many people were denied subventions in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are denying physiotherapy services to people in nursing homes. I am aware of <Col N="531" /> a case involving an elderly woman who received physiotherapy treatment in the community and after she was admitted to hospital. This woman had to go to a nursing home as she was not well enough to return home. However, when she entered the nursing home she was denied physiotherapy treatment. Had she gone home she would have received the treatment.</P>
    <P>Health boards are also denying incontinence wear to elderly people in nursing homes. Such people are being provided with incontinence wear for one week rather than one month. These situations are being ignored by health boards and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report is a damning indictment of the State, its institutions and its agents charged with carrying out the directions of the Oireachtas. The manner in which health boards failed to carry out decisions of this House is at the centre of this report. The report states that the main casualty of this situation is the integrity of the governmental process. It further points out that as currently operated the systems of checks and balances envisaged in the Constitution appear not to be functioning. If those checks were functioning it would be unlikely that difficulties with the nursing home subvention scheme would have arisen. This is a central element of this report which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell highlighted the fact that the report cited Fine Gael's proposal on revolutionising democracy. The report also cites the statement of the Committee of Public Accounts regarding democracy and parliament's central role in that democracy.</P>
      <P>The fall-out from this report will be the repayment of money to elderly people, their children, spouses and relatives who did not receive nursing home subventions. A charge against the cost of caring for their relatives in nursing homes was made against these people's income as they were judged by officials of the State to have an income. When this money has been repaid we should place strong emphasis on the fact that legislation enacted by this House was not implemented and its instructions were not carried out by health boards. Such boards took it upon themselves to decide that the income of relatives should be assessed. That was unconstitutional and incorrect and it should not have happened. This is an important point which the House must not fail to note.</P>
      <P>The cost of keeping people in nursing homes is very high but the subvention has not been increased since 1993. The Minister and I share a constituency and he will be aware that such costs are £300, £350 or £400 per week. However, the maximum subvention is £120. There is a significant shortfall and the subvention should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Society is changing. In some families both spouses are working and households are busier so people do not have time to mind elderly relatives. <Col N="532" /> Many elderly people prefer their independence or cannot be looked after in a domestic situation. Such people require a high level of support.</P>
    <P>This is the reality of modern society whether we like it or not. I wish we could go back to the days when we could support elderly people in family homes but that will not happen. The cost of caring for an elderly person in a nursing home is a huge burden for families.</P>
    <P>The report cites a case of a pensioner who had a charge made against his pension for the cost of caring for his spouse in a nursing home. Another common scenario involves a couple with two, three or four children in university and an elderly relative to support. Such costs were not taken into account by health boards when assessing family incomes.</P>
    <P>The main casualty of this process was the integrity of the governmental process. That is a message for all Members which must be addressed.</P>

      <P>While this report is critical of my Department, I welcome the close examination of the nursing home subvention scheme. I do not believe in shirking criticism but in welcoming it, taking it on board and learning from it.</P>
      <P>I apologise to all those who were adversely affected by the operation of this scheme since its inception in 1993. Deputy Gay Mitchell raised a number of issues but he concentrated his speech on officials to the exclusion of all others. We in this House also have lessons to learn, irrespective of the political party to which we belong. While the Ombudsman's report makes an important point about the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature, it also raises the issue of the relationship between the Department and the Minister of the day. Yet Ministers presided over this scheme since 1993. It is important that the issue of whether relatives should contribute to the care of the elderly was hotly debated during the period. One may get the impression from the Ombudsman's report that this is a surprise and that there was not an issue about whether relatives should be means tested or whether they should make a contribution. The Ministers of the day are on public record as saying that relatives should pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, made it clear to Deputy Harney in 1996 when he said he believed that sons and daughters who were in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so and that the State recognised this contribution in the tax reliefs that gave them such payment. There were questions from Deputies about this aspect of the nursing home subvention scheme in June and October of that year. The Irish Nursing Homes Organisation raised it with successive Ministers. I understand that Deputy Howlin reiterated that viewpoint when he was Minister in 1993. The issue to which the Ombudsman draws attention is that there was not any legal authority to means test relatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>He makes the point that Ministers were not made aware of that fact. There was a political view on all sides of the House. It is easy and convenient to level all the blame at officials &ndash; and fault lies with the administration &ndash; but it is equally important that we in the House accept responsibility and accept there was a culture and a political viewpoint, as articulated by Deputy <Col N="534" /> Noonan when he was Minister for Health, and others that people should pay. The Ombudsman in his conclusion states that it is a complex issue and that the apportioning of blame is a complex issue. We must assess it in the context of the complexity of how Government is operated and the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive. This should not be an exercise in hanging civil servants and leaving everyone else out of the equation. It is deeper and more complex than that.</P>
      <P>The policy of this Government in relation to health services for older people is as outlined in the report, The Years Ahead, first published in 1988 and reaffirmed in the Review of the Years Ahead, published in 1997. This policy is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home of those older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
      <P>It is an inescapable fact that the anticipated change in demographics in the period 1996 to 2011 has and will continue to have significant implications for all service planners, service providers and all of us in government, whether at local or national level. The changing health and social needs of older people present a major challenge to society. The longer that older people remain in good health and disability free the better will be their quality of life and the greater their contribution to society. Ageing is a normal dynamic process; it is not a disease. While ageing is inevitable and irreversible, the chronic disabling conditions which often accompany it can be prevented or delayed not only by medical interventions but also by social, economic and environmental policies. These policies need to be informed by a wider and more positive view of old age.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997 this Government has allocated significant resources to services for older people, particularly health services, in an attempt to deal with this change and the resulting issues which will emerge. Additional funding for the development of health services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, while in 2001 an additional £52 million will be provided. This has resulted in approximately 880 posts approved to services for older people between 1997 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000 over 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1,000 day places per week have been provided in ten new day care centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £2 billion has been made available under the national development plan for investment in our health services. This represents a tre<Col N="535" /> bling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure which will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient centred and accessible service. There is a commitment from this Government to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-hospital sector so that the £2 billion is divided equally between the hospital and community areas. In the case of services for older people, it is proposed to provide a greatly improved physical environment to ensure a high quality and client centred service. Approximately £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. A broad range of facilities will be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result, including assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, day care centres and services for the elderly and mentally infirm.</P>
    <P>Together with considerable investment in health board facilities and in the area of community care, substantial additional resources have also been made available for the nursing home subvention scheme. As Members will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, under which subvention regulations were made, has two principal objectives &ndash; first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. In January of this year 385 private nursing homes were registered under the Act with approximately 6,192 people in receipt of a subvention. It is my intention to increase the rates of subvention from their current levels of £70, £95 and £120 per week, depending on the level of dependency, to £90, £120 and £150 per week with effect from 1 April next. The funding available for the scheme this year is £52 million, which is a 25% increase.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Ombudsman's report into the nursing home subvention scheme was published recently. This report deals in great detail with the role of the Department of Health and Children in making regulations and in overseeing the introduction of the scheme and it examines the administration of the scheme by the health boards since its inception in 1993. However, more importantly for us as Members of the Oireachtas, it also considers the nature of the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Executive and within the Executive and also the relationship between the political and administrative levels. As the Ombudsman says in relation to his findings, &ldquo;any attempt simply to apportion blame, without regard to the complexities of the framework within which government in Ireland operates, runs the risk of the central message in this report being overlooked&rdquo;. I will address that issue shortly. In particular, two articles in the <Col N="536" /> nursing home subvention regulations were the subject of very critical comment, article 8.2, the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; provision and articles 9.1 and 9.2 which allow for the income of adult sons and/or daughters to be assessed when determining the level of subvention to be paid. My immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay, and in this regard I will outline the action taken to date.</P>
    <P>Article 8.2 of the nursing home subvention regulations, 1993, allows health boards to disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 &ndash; by this Government, by the way &ndash; to six of the eight health boards where the regulations were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of Article 8.2 arrears. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to conclude, I will finish the point. I have not finished the section yet. These regulations, signed in July 1996, increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and <Col N="537" /> daughters of an applicant for subvention. The funding was intended to address both problems and to meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally, that is, both in the 1996 regulations and the arrears in the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; provision.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting between officials of the Department and representatives of the Office of the Ombudsman in December 1999, my Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears. The Department took up the matter with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue the matter. I am advised that the current position is that where arrears were due to be paid, health boards have made retrospective payments in respect of persons currently resident in nursing homes. I understand that some boards have also paid arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes. My Department has instructed the relevant boards to take immediate steps to pay all outstanding arrears. The health boards have advised that, to date, approximately £900,000 has been paid out in respect of article 8.2 arrears.</P>

I have made it clear to the health boards that I do not want any holding back in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, this allocation was not intended to be used solely for the payment of article 8.2 arrears. The Department has been informed by the health boards concerned that the funding provided was used to cover arrears payments under article 8.2, additional expenditure arising as a result of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996, the payment of enhanced subventions, expenditure shortfalls arising from increasing demands under the scheme, and legal and other costs associated with the administration of the scheme. I understand that a proportion of the allocation was used by three health boards to fund other services for <Col N="538" /> older people, including the provision of aids and appliances, improved home help services and the opening of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm. While this money was not expended on the subvention scheme, I am assured that it was used by the relevant health boards for the benefit of older people. It is an important point to be made in view of some of the accusations that the money could have been or was misappropriated. The money was spent on services for the elderly&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was spent on the people whose money was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it could have been spent faster in relation to the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; arrears. As the Ombudsman has outlined, articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. A review of the operation of the subvention scheme was carried out in 1995. Following this review, an amendment was made to the schedule which provided that, in calculating the income of sons and daughters, health boards were to disregard income tax, rent, mortgage repayments etc. This schedule increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and daughters of an applicant for subvention. The subvention regulations were further amended from 1 January 1999 and the provision to assess the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent was deleted. The decision to delete that provision altogether was taken by my predecessor, Deputy Cowen. For the previous six years it had been invoked.</P>
      <P>This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not, as the Ombudsman has pointed out, consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and-or daughters of applicants. Nonetheless, I am concerned that the issue of making payments to those who were adversely affected by this regulation remains. I have already stated and am now restating that, irrespective of whether there is a legal liability, there is a moral responsibility to make sure we make retrospective payments in relation to the family circumstances issue to all those who were adversely affected by that decision. We estimate the cost to be about £6 million. We secured that in the Estimate, we are moving ahead on that basis and the moneys will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to advise the House that a group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been <Col N="539" /> established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. The group had its first meeting last week. I hope Deputies will appreciate that since the introduction of the nursing home scheme, approximately 35,000 applications for subvention have been received. This will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I offer assurances that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A further issue that has been raised in the House in the recent past is that of inspection procedures for extended care facilities. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in private nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may impose conditions in relation to registration. These regulations provide for periodic inspections by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the fact that while there is provision under the nursing home legislation for monitoring standards in private nursing homes involving inspections as outlined earlier, no similar arrangements are in place for health board facilities, an issue I intend to rectify. As Deputies will be aware, the social services inspectorate has the authority to monitor standards in children's residential centres and is operating very effectively. I intend to expand the role of the inspectorate to cover extended care facilities for older people. Given the heavy demands on the inspectorate in relation to the monitoring of standards in the child care area, additional resources will be required to enable the inspectorate to take on this additional function. I intend to bring proposals to this effect to Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I also want to advise the House of the progress being made by the working group established by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, which is currently preparing guidance and training materials in relation to elder abuse, including abuse in institutional settings. Following publication of the report Abuse<i>, </i>Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, established a broadly-based working group which is advising on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. The group is drawing up a comprehensive two-year work programme which will culminate in the preparation of an evaluation report to be submitted to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. The Minister of state has been <Col N="540" /> provided with significant resources to ensure that the work is completed within the timeframe envisaged.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring forward proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary, arising from both the Ombudsman's report &ndash; there are significant implications there &ndash; and the expenditure review, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>Chapter 8 of the report draws some far-reaching conclusions as to how Government operates under the Constitution. The report makes a number of suggestions as to how the position might be improved through better use of the Oireachtas committee system, a mechanism for monitoring secondary legislation by affirmative resolutions of the Oireachtas and a more effective system for dealing with annual Estimates, particularly for expenditure required to meet entitlements under State schemes introduced by the Oireachtas. These issues are not just matters for consideration by my Department, nor or they issues that can be addressed by this Government alone. They have implications for all future Governments and will affect the way Members of the Oireachtas deal with matters in the future.</P>
    <P>This report raises significant issues not just for me as Minister for Health and Children or any member of the Government. It raises issues not only about how we introduce legislation or how we deal with funding entitlements but it raises questions about human rights, an issue of concern for us all. It highlights examples of inequity of treatment between health boards for subvention applicants. Any inequity of treatment concerns me greatly and I intend to put in place fair and proper systems to ensure that this accusation cannot be levelled again. I intend to introduce performance management indicators across all health boards to accurately measure the performance of our health services. This procedure has been started in my Department and I am confident it will successfully transfer to health boards.</P>
    <P>I intend to refer this report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and that it will report back to us within six months.</P>

      <P>In the conclusion to his report on nursing homes subventions by the health boards, the Ombudsman drew attention to general problems he believes have arisen from a shift in the balance of relationships between the Legislature and the Executive. That balance is laid down in the Constitution. These issues are of great importance to all in this House and are of a special interest to those of us who participate in the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. I have the privilege of being the chairman of that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Our committee has reviewed certain constitutional provisions relating to the institutions of the State. We have already presented progress reports on the Office of the President and on the courts and the Judiciary. I compliment the Fine Gael interest for adopting our ideas in relation to the courts and the Judiciary in a policy programme they launched before Christmas last.</P>
    <P>We are studying the provisions relating to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government. In our study, we have available to us the monumental report of the Constitutional Review Group published in 1996. This review was not a political document prepared by public figures but a report commissioned by the Taoiseach and the Government from technical experts in constitutional jurisprudence. That report contains some valuable observations on the Oireachtas and the Government but it has been criticised for a failure to examine the key issues which the Ombudsman has highlighted in his report. The Ombudsman referred to this criticism.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest criticisms of the Constitutional Review Group report was that it did not analyse the single strongest criticised feature of modern liberal democratic practice, namely, the existence of an executive state and the fact the powers of the Executive in modern democratic entities have become utterly disproportionate to the powers exercised by legislative and judicial arms of government. The review group was criticised at the time and the Ombudsman has taken up that criticism in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>In a democratic society, the cardinal values are freedom, equality and justice and the institutions of state are the media through which these values are expressed. Careful checks and balances to ensure that no one institution can act in a tyrannical way are essential. We strive to maintain an independent Judiciary to secure justice. To secure freedom and equality, we give the task of making the laws to the representatives of the people in the Houses of the Oireachtas, primarily in Dáil Éireann. We give the Executive the power, the authority, to apply the laws to the people and we maintain a check on the activities of the Government by making it answerable to the Legislature.</P>
    <P>However, the Ombudsman makes the point that the notion that Oireachtas sets policy, makes the laws and then leaves it to the Executive to implement the laws does not fit in with how Government operates in practice. It is questionable whether it has ever fitted in since the foundation of the Irish Free State which preceded the Constitution. The Government, once elected, controls the Houses of the Oireachtas and this results in a natural diminution in the capacity of the Houses to supervise the Executive. For all practical purposes, the Government decides policy, proposes legislation, ensures the passage of legislation through the Oireachtas and, in its Executive capacity, ensures that the laws are implemented.</P>
    <P>Because it is clear that the processes do not conform to what is envisaged in theory in the <Col N="542" /> Constitution, one has the choice, the Ombudsman suggests, of legitimising the current process by way of an appropriate amendment to the Constitution, while providing some new system of checks and balances or else making the process conform to the Constitution. A number of very substantial checks on Executive power have been introduced in recent years. One obvious one, with which we deal daily as parliamentarians and Ministers, is the freedom of information legislation. That has become a very powerful check on the operations of the Executive.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this imbalance which the Ombudsman has pointed out &ndash; the imbalance between the Executive and the Legislature &ndash; it may be necessary to resort to a constitutional amendment but there are several measures which can be taken within the existing scheme. The powers of committees to scrutinise legislation and review the activities of Government could be strengthened. Greater resources could be placed at the disposal of Deputies and Senators to allow them to research issues more thoroughly. This is a fundamental issue in relation to parliamentary scrutiny of the operations of the Executive. As suggested in an early report of our committee chaired at the time by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, Seanad Éireann could be empowered to examine secondary legislation, including European Union legislation. Many commentators on our legislative arrangements have commented on the paucity of parliamentary checks on both European Union and secondary legislation. That is a serious issue raised in the report.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that when it came to implementation of this legislation through regulation, it was not subject to any real parliamentary scrutiny even though the Ombudsman points out, and many Deputies and Senators pointed out at the time of the enactment of the 1990 Act, it was extremely general in its aspects &ndash; extremely generous in the powers it gave to the Minister. Reading between the lines of the report of the Ombudsman, it is clear that the necessary financial resources were not committed at the time to ensure the effective implementation of the Act. This is a recurring problem with legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be aspirational and it is all too tempting for any Minister to introduce legislation which is full of high sounding principle, but the translation of these principles, either in the courts or through administrative action, can be a very expensive operation which the Exchequer is not yet ready to contemplate. That seems to have been at the heart of the problem we had to face up to in this report. Many changes could be introduced to the Standing Orders of the Houses which would modernise our procedures and make our analysis of legislation, of secondary legislation and of Executive action more real. This Government is committed to that kind of review of Parliament and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Govern<Col N="543" /> ment Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, has brought forward proposals.</P>
    <P>Although it is not particularly relevant to this debate, we are also willing to look at the question of political funding and how it should be done in a way that would command public confidence in the institutions of State. There is no point in the Opposition posturing on these issues all the time and making one issue the main issue while ignoring the fact that we need comprehensive controls on political-&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's leader received the largest number of corporate contributions of any Deputy in the House in the last general election. They were disclosed in accordance with the legislation. Let us get real about this. We need comprehensive control on expenditure as well as on donations. I do not take issue with that. Let us stop arguing about details all the time in this House and get down to the nub of the issue that we have to agree a set of ground rules about how we are elected and how we operate as a Parliament that are agreed as rational and fair and give us the confidence we need among the public.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's opinion is that in the longer term, the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Executive as well as the relationships within the Executive may need to the thought through afresh in the context of a wider programme of constitutional reform. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution shares this view and it is at present carrying out a study of these issues. Clearly the Ombudsman's report is a graphic example of the pressing need for effective oversight of Government and public administration. For a small country like Ireland, the committee is well aware of the need to ensure the Government has the capacity to respond speedily to challenges in the external environment. Too sensitive a balance could lead to an enfeebled Executive. Nevertheless such a study could be greatly deepened by the consultation with individuals and groups that we successfully carried out in our report on abortion. We will be discussing this issue at our next meeting. I know the Ombudsman's report will be a valuable contribution to this study.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party fully supports the motion before the House. I am pleased the Minister is present to hear this debate. This House and this democracy owes a huge debt of gratitude to the work of the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, in producing his report on nursing home subventions. The findings of this report are <Col N="544" /> shocking and demand an urgent and serious response from the State. This report demonstrates how one of the most vulnerable groups in society, elderly people in need of long-term nursing care, were neglected and ripped off by the State.</P>
      <P>There are many lessons to be learned from this scandal. I hope this debate will highlight the several areas where reform is needed. I expect the Minister to accept the failings that occurred within his Department over a long number of years and announce a compensation package for the elderly and their families who paid the price for the maladministration and institutional dishonesty which has characterised this sordid affair.</P>
      <P>Nursing home care for the elderly is one of the most important functions which a State can provide. In common with the development of many Irish social services since the foundation of the State, this area of care has been historically underfunded and neglected. Religious institutions often fill the gap left by the absence of State provision. No universal care service was available to older people or their families. Nursing home care was run on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, where a mixture of charity, State provision and private enterprise, provided a complicated and partial level of care.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was an attempt to provide some degree of State assistance to families and individuals attempting to find a nursing home bed in these circumstances. The Act came into force by regulation in 1993 and was further amended in 1996. That the regulations have not been amended since then is a scandal and an affront to older people. The existing rate of subvention is £70 for medium dependency, £95 for high dependency and £120 for maximum dependency. Under the 1996 regulations, provision was made for additional payments in exceptional circumstances which, in practical terms, amounted to £300 per week, including income pensions of the person.</P>
      <P>The financial provision for the subvention scheme is totally inadequate. There is a waiting list for those who are classified as having exceptional needs. The scheme operates as crudely as this, as one older person dies another person is taken off the waiting list. This scandal must be addressed. Progress in this area is unlikely unless there is a change in Government and the Labour Party participates in that Government. At the behest of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Government has continued to pander to the rich and neglect the elderly. When the Minister hears the comments on this report will he be able to say that justice has been done to these people? I am sure he can never say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the costs of private nursing homes in the greater Dublin area are in the region of £450 to £500 per week, how can older people without private means afford a nursing home bed? This is a basic right to which older people are entitled under legislation. Under the 1996 regulations, which were never debated here, an <Col N="545" /> older person with property, generally a family home, of a valuation in excess of £80,000 to £90,000, in all probability, will be ineligible for subvention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was in Government when that Bill was enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in 1996. Five years further down the line the value of that same house in Dublin today would be £180,000. Nothing has been done about this since 1996 and the Minister is negligent. The Government is negligent in respect of caring for the elderly. Is it any wonder we have such a report. The Ombudsman's report generally refers to the past. The Minister was responsible for the operation of this scheme. By not updating the scheme, the Minister is responsible for cheating and denying older people their statutory right to nursing home care as covered in legislation. Those people whose homes are valued at £80,000 or £90,000 are ineligible for subvention. Had the Minister upgraded the value of property they would have been eligible.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Ombudsman when he refers to the general lack of clarity regarding health board obligations in respect of long-stay patients. Older people are not being told they have a statutory right to long-stay care. Older sick persons and their families are being pressurised to get out of hospital under the guise that an acute bed is required. A constituent of mine who is 82 years of age was told two days before Christmas she had to leave Beaumont Hospital notwithstanding the fact that her family believed she was not fit or strong enough to go home. She was told the hospital would pay for a two-week stay in a convalescent home. She went to the convalescent home under pressure rather than fight the case. Only now is she strong enough to go home. The hospital will not pay for the additional period in the home and neither she nor her family can afford the cost. This is an example of the shambles in the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 legislation should have marked a watershed in nursing home care for the elderly. Fortunately, the Ombudsman's report reveals that it only served to open up a new chapter of deception for older persons and their relatives. The manner in which older people were denied their legal entitlements have been outlined by other speakers. The system of subvention as operated by health boards was radically different from that intended by the 1990 Act. Relatives of persons seeking subvention were subjected to a means test. This resulted in hardship and suffering for hundreds of families. However, the Ombudsman's report clearly demonstrates that this abuse of the system by the Department of Health and Children and the health board was known to be legally unsound for at least five years. In the Ombudsman's words: &ldquo;It is an inescapable conclusion that the Department presided over a set of practices for a period of more than <Col N="546" /> five years in the knowledge that these practices were legally indefensible.&rdquo;  This is a shocking conclusion. It reveals an official neglect and disregard for the rights of older people in a Department that is legally obliged to uphold and defend them.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about what happened. The Minister must announce to the House this evening that a mechanism will be put in place to ensure that the families who paid the price for this scandal are compensated. It is the least the State can do. The Government must also initiate a programme of investment and reform which will prevent a situation like this from recurring.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has proposed a radical new direction in health policy, including the establishment of a system of universal access, which would go a long way to destroy the two tier system that affects so many. The Minister is giving favourable consideration to our policy and I hope he will act accordingly. I also hope he will deal with the elderly, the most vulnerable group in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Other speakers have addressed the issues of pocket money and relatives' incomes. The Minister said he intends to ensure that the moneys involved will be repaid by the health boards. I am concerned that this should be done as quickly as possible. As a member of a health board, people have contacted me since the publication of this report. They are concerned that it may take some time before moneys are repaid. I understand my health board will first address the pocket money issue, because administratively it is easier to proceed on that basis, but that it will take a considerable time to deal with the question of relatives' incomes.</P>
      <P>This week I was contacted by a person whose mother has been in a nursing home since 1985. The person concerned is on a relatively modest income and nobody else in her family is in a position to help with the costs involved. She is owed money on the two counts referred to. When she inquired to the health board she was told it would take a considerable time before the issue of her income was addressed. The main problem appears to be the lack of resources to compile the necessary information. Will the Minister consider giving whatever assistance is needed to the health boards to ensure that the money can be repaid as quickly as possible? People in this situation need it. The woman in question is at her wits' end. The nursing home where her mother is resident is to increase its fees by 20% and her increased subvention will probably be allocated to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister do anything to regulate increases in costs by nursing homes? Like the private rented sector in the housing market, the homes should be allowed to apply increases by only certain amounts. At present they effectively operate in a free market where they can raise their prices as much as they wish. The nursing home subvention scheme could consume a lot of money and much of it could be directed to the <Col N="547" /> private nursing homes rather than to improving the service. The Minister must address that. In this regard I welcome the examinations he is conducting into the present system.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for the care of the elderly. According to official statistics those over the age of 65 number approximately 437,000. This is projected to increase by more than 50%, to 673,000, by 2021. In view of this, it is essential that extra resource are provided, although I do not expect it all to happen during the Minister's term of office.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board I can confirm that ther is a shortage of resources allocated to this area. The provision of new services require extra resources which are provided at the expense of other services. For example, St. Camillus's hospital, Limerick, is the main provider of long stay public beds for people in Limerick city and surrounding areas and it and only one other hospital in west Limerick cover the whole of Limerick city and county. We have lost 41 long stay beds in the past two years because of the money needed to provide respite beds, a stroke unit, an Alzheimer's assessment unit and other worthwhile and necessary services. It was put to us at health board level that the closure of the long stay beds was necessary to provide for the new services. We have debated this issue at a number of health board meetings. Members across parties and professional representatives agree it is wrong, yet there is a desire to provide new services. It is a dilemma that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report addresses the issue of top-up payments. The Health Act, 1970, provides that people have a right to in-patient long or short stay care, especially if they have a medical card where there should be no question of assessing means. The Ombudsman points out that where people are referred to nursing homes, through subvention or otherwise, the health boards should provide for top-up payments where necessary. On page 19 of his report the Ombudsman points out that some of the health boards refuse to implement these payments, even though they are provided for under sections 10(6) and 22(4) of the 1970 Act and notwithstanding advice by the Department that they should do so. The Ombudsman is pursuing this aspect with the health boards.</P>
    <P>Our health board does not provide top-up subventions. Last Friday we passed a resolution that the board should commence them. The South Eastern Health Board provides them and patients from the mid-west, in east Limerick, who are resident in nursing homes in Tipperary town are unable to avail of them while people from south Tipperary, which is in the South Eastern Health Board area, can do so.</P>
    <P>This is an issue of serious concern to a huge number of people and it is raised with me probably more often than most other issues, especially by families who cannot afford to look after their elderly members who need long-term care. There <Col N="548" /> are not enough public beds for them while the money allocated to the nursing home system is preventing the allocation of the necessary resources for the provision of public beds. The Minister should set aside specific funding for public long-term beds rather than for private nursing homes, who can increase their prices at will. We must ring fence money for the public long-term care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>While there is a need for a continuum of services in the community, there is also a need for long-term beds. As people live longer a greater need arises. It is scandalous that families are put in a position where they cannot afford the long-term care of their elderly and where the elderly are pressurised because they know that family members have to try to scrape the money together. The Minister must address this very serious issue, especially in view of demographic changes, where there will be a 50% increase in the number of people over the age of 65 by 2021.</P>
    <P>These issues are as important as the two issues that received the most media attention in relation to this report.</P>

      <P>This issue relates to the total inadequacy of the current accommodation levels at Gainstown national school, County Westmeath, which cannot cater for the numbers attending this popular and dynamic school. The area has an increased population base and the school cannot cater for either the current or future demands which Deputy McGrath and I will outline. It was built originally in 1930 as a two teacher school. An additional room was built in 1959, which constitutes the old part of the school buildings. Four additional classrooms were built in 1990, which was a well designed extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of management made a detailed and comprehensive submission to the Department seeking the immediate go ahead for the provision of an additional four classrooms to ensure the necessary space and other facilities are provided. At present the small staff room which caters for approximately seven teachers also serves as the school administrative office. This room serves a couple of days a week as a classroom for the remedial students in the school, which is not acceptable. Likewise, when the school nurse or medical team arrive to examine children, the room must serve as the focus for these examinations. Deputy McGrath and I recently tabled questions in this regard. Children are examined <Col N="549" /> in full view of the school yard as there are no curtains. Most of the administrative work is carried out in the hallway and corridors of the school. The cloakroom and library are also located there.</P>
    <P>There are currently 202 pupils in the school and this will increase to 216 in September. The Minister of State must agree that this constitutes gross overcrowding. He will also be aware that in the recent weeks the school was cited in the INTO's report on substandard schools. This referred to inadequate space, ventilation difficulties, inadequate toilet facilities and so on. Pressure of space led to the GP room being split in two by a curtain and used as two classrooms. This means pupils have no gym, no room for indoor sports, music or art. The Minister of State will be aware of the difficulties of teaching in such overcrowded conditions. This all amounts to extremely difficult conditions for teachers, pupils and managers. Due to overcrowding, there is virtually no furniture in the rooms except desks and chairs and there is very little space between the furniture.</P>
    <P>Full details of conditions in the school have been already conveyed to the planning and building unit of the Department. Deputy McGrath and I raised the question of additional accommodation and facilities in the school in the Dáil on a number of occasions. I urge the Minister of State to expedite the process and deal with the application as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Gainstown national school shot to notoriety in recent weeks when it was listed in the INTO report of below standard primary schools. The school is located approximately four miles from Mullingar town in a rural setting. It was originally built in 1930 for two teachers and a four room extension was added in 1990. The school currently has 202 pupils and seven teachers. It is grossly overcrowded with what was intended to be a GP room now being used, not as one classroom, which might be the case in normal overcrowding situations, but to facilitate two teachers, one teacher on either side of a curtain with their respective classes, and a class on each side of this flimsy partition. I am sure the Minister of State can imagine the difficulties teaching children in such conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A remedial teacher visits the school two days a week and the only space available for her classes is in the staff room. Routine medical examinations by the school nurses must take place in the staff room in full view of the school yard. Cloakroom and library facilities are also available but only in the corridor. How can teachers and children work in such inadequate facilities? How can the Minister of State condone such a lack of physical infrastructure? An application for additional facilities in the school was lodged in the Department last November. This application has been examined and endorsed by the area inspector but there has been a deafening silence <Col N="550" /> from the Department. The application has not even been formally acknowledged. In response to a parliamentary question today I was told that the matter is being examined and a response will issue as soon as possible. That is not good enough. The partners in education such as the board of management, parents, teachers and the Department's inspector agree that additional facilities are required. These include a GP room, computer room and multi-purpose room. I call on the Minister to approve an extension to the school and allow the school authorities to employ their own architect. In doing so, they can provide the necessary space needed to expand the school.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to set out the position in relation to accommodation at Gainstown national school.</P>
      <P>Gainstown national school is located approximately four miles outside Mullingar town. Pupil numbers in the school have increased from 174 in September 1999 to 202 in September 2000. The school currently has a staffing level of a principal and six class teachers. A remedial post is shared with a neighbouring school.</P>
      <P>An application from the school authorities for additional accommodation was received in my Department in late November 2000. This application is being examined by the planning and building unit of the Department, in conjunction with a report which has been prepared by the inspector for the area. As soon as this examination is completed, a response will issue to the board of management at the earliest possible date. Pending a decision on the school's requirement for additional permanent accommodation, it is open to the board of management to apply for temporary accommodation under my Department's rental scheme. Under that scheme, 95% of the cost of renting interim accommodation is refundable to schools.</P>
      <P>I reassure the school authorities that any decision by the board to rent accommodation as an interim measure will not have an adverse effect on my Department's decision regarding the provision of permanent facilities to the school.</P>

      <P>That the chief executive officer and the chairman of the North Eastern Health Board have convened a meeting of the board for Thursday morning to inform it that there is no extension from its insurance company for Monaghan General Hospital Maternity Unit by 28 February means the Minister must intervene to guarantee that cover. I understand the board, through the Minister, has requested one obste<Col N="551" /> trician and one paediatrician which would allow adequate and safe cover to mothers and children. Up to now many relatively big maternity units are run by two consultants. These include Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Tralee to name just four. Why does the review group and chief executives insist that no less than three will be acceptable in Monaghan General Hospital?</P>
      <P>The Condon report considered that it is safe for a midwife led unit in Dundalk but not in Monaghan because, in their words, &ldquo;it is isolated and far from the nearest maternity unit in Cavan or Drogheda&rdquo;. How cannot the same review group see the dangers for emergency maternity cases in Carrickroe or Moybridge who would have to travel up to 50 miles if the Monaghan General Hospital maternity unit was closed? Consultants have tried to prove there is no problem in distance regardless of poor quality roads or weather conditions. Many families have true stories to tell in relation to how their babies were saved due to the Monaghan hospital maternity unit.</P>
      <P>Cross-Border discussions are taking place regarding co-operation and possible increased numbers. The Minister should give these talks a chance by removing the deadline. Temporary closure will mean that a maternity unit will not ever again exist in Monaghan General Hospital. It sends out the wrong message. One review group closed a theatre and that is now being refurbished. What is to stop the executive officers using another review group to close the hospital altogether?</P>
      <P>Morale was never at such a low level among the excellent staff. They have the lowest ratio per patient in the country.</P>
      <P>The development committee is exhausted. This hospital was saved 17 years ago but has been starved of resources since then. When he was Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan provided £500,000 to upgrade the theatre but the work was not done until now. The female medical ward has been restructured but the £10 million the current Minister has guaranteed for the hospital must be spent. With the breakdown of trust between the health board members from Monaghan and the executive officers, it is vital that the Minister visit Monaghan and clarify to the people there that this £10 million, and more if necessary, will be spent to restructure and upgrade the hospital.</P>
      <P>The fact that some relatively inexpensive equipment has not been provided leaves the doctors and staff in a vulnerable position. They generally believe a decision has been taken behind closed doors to bleed the hospital of services in the hope that it will die. Why not use the personnel available in the area to do blood tests instead of sending the tubes of blood or the patients elsewhere? The Minister has the funds, far more than was ever available in the history of the State, and he should provide the insurance, personnel and the new start necessary for Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has been blamed by some of <Col N="552" /> my colleagues for not applying enough pressure in this matter. However, the health board members are working together to save and upgrade the hospital. I have worked with Deputy O'Hanlon on this matter in the House and I now hand over to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Crawford, for sharing his time with me. Sometimes I am blamed in this regard but, as Deputy Crawford knows, Monaghan was fortunate in 1987 to have the Minister for Health as its representative, otherwise the hospital might have gone the way of some other hospitals, such as the North Infirmary in the current Minister's constituency.</P>
      <P>In this instance, we are discussing the maternity unit in Monaghan General Hospital. Half the babies born to mothers in the county are born outside the hospital's catchment area because of the staffing levels. The executive of the health board gave the members no choices but just presented them with a <i>fait accompli</i> to close the units. Health board members, in their wisdom, decided to continue the maternity services in both units. They want extra consultants to ensure a safer service for the mothers and their children.</P>
      <P>I will not discuss the changes over the past 15 years when there were no obstetricians in many of the hospitals. They were staffed by a county physician and a county surgeon who were responsible for care. I appeal to the executive of the health board to employ locums in Monaghan and Dundalk, to the Irish Public Bodies Mutual to withdraw its notice to the health board that it will not continue its insurance cover and to an comhairle to approve the necessary appointments. I ask them to give Monaghan and Dundalk a chance. The health board promised to build a new maternity unit in Monaghan less than three years ago. It should get on with that and give the hospital a chance to develop a viable, safe service for the families, particularly the mothers and their infants, in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for raising this issue. I acknowledge the strong representations they have continued to make, with other public representatives in this House and members of the health board, since before Christmas in relation to both the maternity unit and the future development of Monaghan General Hospital. The Deputies have been vigorous in their pursuit of me and the Department on these issues.</P>
      <P>The provision of maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board, in the first instance, which has statutory responsibility for the provision of health services in its functional area. The North Eastern Health Board is committed to developing acute hospital services in line with the needs and requirements of its resident population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, the board adopted a policy framework for the development of its acute hospitals, North <Col N="553" /> East Hospitals, The Next Five Years &ndash; A Framework For Continuing Development. This emphasised the need for high quality, safe and accessible acute hospital services, utilising all five hospital sites within the board's area. It confirmed the commitment of the board to developing each hospital site within the two hospital groups, Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and Louth-Meath hospital group. The framework document recommended that the maternity services in the region be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The review group established for this purpose reported in late 2000. Briefly, the report indicated that: consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk should cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services be established in Dundalk; and consultant-led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan. I have been advised that the health board decided &ldquo;not to accept in full the recommendations&rdquo; in the review group's report and it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit that will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning as anticipated in the national development plan. It is proposed that the board will finalise plans for this review at its next monthly meeting which, I understand, will take place next Thursday.</P>
    <P>I am of the firm view that the way forward for maternity services is about putting in place services which comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice recommendations. I met the chairman and representatives of the board and emphasised the need to ensure patient and staff safety. I informed the board that it is imperative that it establishes and finalises a clear view on the services that will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services required to be developed and the enhancement of existing services in light of the £160 million national development plan funding which has been notified to the board. I look forward to receiving the board's proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have been vigorous in making that point to the health board on a number of occasions since this situation developed. We want to see developments at each hospital site, clearly defined roles for each hospital and the trust that has broken down to be re-established so that people will see there is a future for Monaghan hospital. We have made the funding available in the national development plan and that funding is still secure.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the board further considered the question of maternity services at special meetings in January and February of this year. To avoid the suspension of maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk, the health board mandated the chief executive officer to seek, as a matter of urgency, approval for the appointment of temporary consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath <Col N="554" /> hospitals and to seek, in addition, approval for the immediate appointment of on-site paediatric cover at both hospitals.</P>
    <P>The approval of any such posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, which is the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts. My Department will have appropriate discussions with the board regarding funding for the posts following the decision of an comhairle in the matter. We have written back to the health boards. That will facilitate the health boards making the application to an comhairle in relation to additional consultant staff. Following consideration by an comhairle we will discuss the funding issues with the board.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that insurance cover is an issue for the board and its insurers, who have a contractual relationship in this matter. With regard to the overall development and upgrading of Monaghan General Hospital, I understand from the board that this is secure within the indicative capital funding made available to it under the national development plan for capital development projects across its hospital groups. A project team is advancing a design brief for the development and upgrading of the hospital and I am assured that considerable progress has been made by the project team in this regard. I will keep a close eye on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter. The sale of paracetamol products must be restricted to pharmacies and the Minister should immediately introduce regulations to provide for this. In 1999, 439 people, 349 males and 90 females, died by suicide. Pharmacists have called on the Government to control the sale of paracetamol because of possible links to suicide. In the US, paracetamol products can only be bought from pharmacists. Ireland and the UK are the only EU countries where the drug can be bought in the corner shop, supermarket or petrol station. Paracetamol poisoning is not a problem in other EU countries where restrictions are in place. In 1999, 1,452 people were discharged from Irish hospitals with a diagnosis of paracetamol poisoning. Of that number, 43 were diagnosed with a liver condition. This is almost double the number of the previous year when 25 were diagnosed with a liver condition.</P>
      <P>Paracetamol is a potential killer which can be found in almost every home. It is freely available. I am extremely concerned that there is an epidemic of potentially lethal paracetamol overdoses among young people, especially young women. One study found that the female ratio was 2:1. This has been of concern to doctors and psychiatrists and costs the country a fortune. Yet the public seems blissfully unaware that a drug, which is contained in the bathroom cabinets of most homes, can have such lethal effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 129 medicinal products on <Col N="555" /> the market which contain paracetamol The sale of these products should be confined to pharmacy outlets. At point of sale, advice should be given on the dangers of the drug in terms of overdose. Due to concerns over the serious effects arising from overdoses in paracetamol, the Irish Medicines Board drew up a series of recommendations in 1997 in relation to the sale of paracetamol, including a recommendation that non-pharmacy retail outlets should only carry packs containing not more than 12 500 mg tablets or equivalent. It is a disgrace that three years after this recommendation was made, the Minister for Health and Children has failed to give statutory effect to the recommendations made by the board.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last October, the Minister stated that &ldquo;regulations to restrict the availability of paracetamol, which would give statutory effect to the recommendations by the Irish Medicines Board, are currently under consideration in my Department&rdquo;. These recommendations have been under consideration for more than three and a half years and it is time the Minister made up his mind to save lives and prevent huge levels of suffering.</P>
    <P>In 1999, 3,406 cases of self-inflicted poisonings were recorded, of which 1,003 were diagnosed as paracetamol poisoning. Of these, 315 were male and 688 were female. A reduction in the number of poisonings through the control of paracetamol products would have a significant effect on the number of poisonings.</P>
    <P>A total of 25 liver transplants was carried out in Ireland in 1999. It is estimated that half of all liver transplants result from paracetamol poisoning. People have a perception that this is a harmless drug but it can cause severe damage. Taken in small doses, paracetamol is an excellent drug which is broken down in the liver to harmless by-products to be eliminated by the kidneys. However, of the 1,758 cases of hospitalisation in 1999 due to kidney failure, it is estimated that 10% were due to misuse of painkillers. Opponents of restriction suggest that people of suicidal tendencies will obtain drugs elsewhere or use other methods. I do not accept this. Suicidal ideation may be transient. It may be a crisis moment. It is internationally accepted that if one restricts availability of means, one can limit suicide.</P>
    <P>A striking reduction in suicide rates occurred in Britain in the mid-1960s. This reduction is thought to have been largely due to the detoxification of the domestic gas supply. Following the discovery of North Sea gas, domestic supplies in Britain were gradually changed from highly toxic coal gas to relatively non-lethal natural gas. In the 1960s, domestic gas poisoning was the most commonly used means of suicide in Britain and its reduced lethality led to a marked reduction in overall suicide rates. Similar changes occurred in Australia with restrictions on barbiturate prescribing, in the USA with the introduction of <Col N="556" /> catalytic converters and in Canada with the introduction of gun control laws.</P>
    <P>In his address to the 1998 annual conference of the Irish Association of Suicidology in Castlebar, Dr. David J. Gunnell, senior lecturer in epidemiology and public health medicine at Bristol University, had at the top of his list of six proposals for suicide prevention by the reduction of access to means: &ldquo;Reduce the quantity of paracetamol and aspirin that may be purchased over the counter.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter and appreciate his concerns about the need to restrict paracetamol products to pharmacies. I am sadly aware that paracetamol overdose still represents one of the most common types of overdose in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The current position in regard to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol both in pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets is based on the recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board. As the Deputy is aware, the board is the competent authority for the granting and renewal of product authorisations under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. These authorisations set out the conditions subject to which medicinal products may be placed on the market. The primary aim is to promote public health by ensuring that medicinal products available to members of the Irish public meet the required standards of safety, quality and efficacy in accordance with the obligation arising from current EU and national legislative requirements.</P>
      <P>Due to concerns about the serious effects arising from overdoses of paracetamol, the Irish Medicines Board drew up a series of recommendations in 1997 on the sale of paracetamol, including a recommendation to restrict its sale in non-pharmacy retail outlets to packs containing not more that 12 500 mg tablets or equivalent. Following extensive consultation, almost all of the manufacturers concerned have supported the recommendations and have agreed to conform with them with a view to implementing them in order enhance public safety. However, I am aware of a recent report which indicates that not all non-pharmacy outlets are complying with the board's recommendations and this is a matter of concern to me.</P>
      <P>Regulations to restrict the availability of paracetamol, which would give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board, are currently under consideration in the Department. These recommendations relate to pack size and availability in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets and will, as outlined, subject packs of paracetamol above a particular size to pharmacy only or prescription only control, as appropriate. I understand the majority of manufacturers already operate within these guidelines in anticipation of the introduction of the new regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft regulations are at an advanced stage and I will take the steps necessary to ensure their <Col N="557" /> completion at an early date. I will also take on board the other points made by the Deputy in regard to the broader issue of suicide.</P>

      <P>The<i> Sunday Business Post</i> of 11 February contains a report in which it is alleged that five members of An Garda Síochána and a civilian fleet manager of the Garda transport division went on trips to Spain, Italy and Portugal organised and paid for by Advance Pit-Stop Tyre Company in the period 1997 to 1999 and that they also were taken for a two day trip to Manchester which included a visit to Coronation Street studios at Granada Television and attending a Manchester United European Champions League tie. All of the trips listed appear also to have included various rounds of golf on well known golf courses.</P>
      <P>It is alleged that all of the gardaí concerned are attached to the Garda transport section at Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park. While Oliver Hanlon, the Garda civilian fleet manager described the visits to the paper as &ldquo;fact-finding trips&rdquo; and explained invitations received stated the gardaí concerned would be inspecting tyre factories, it is reported that none of the trips involved visits to tyre factories. On the surface, it seems that these trips were simply holidays or junkets organised by the tyre company for the benefit of gardaí involved in the Garda transport section with which Advance Pit-Stop does substantial business.</P>
      <P>Oliver Hanlon is reported as informing the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> that Advance Pit-Stop sells An Garda Síochána more than £600,000 worth of tyres per annum. While this allegedly represents less than 5% of Advance Pit-Stops annual sales, it also represents the largest contract held by the company, providing about 7,000 tyres a year to An Garda Síochána. The Garda Press Office, an agency paid for by taxpayers of this State is quoted as giving the following explanation for the trips:</P>
      <P>If there is a benefit to an Garda Síochána and no cost to the taxpayer, then consideration is given to attending seminars and visiting manufacturing processes. These decisions are made on the basis of the benefit to be accrued by the organisation.</P>
      <P>It seems clear from the reports, if accurate, that these trips did not involve attendance at any seminars whatsoever nor did they involve visiting manufacturing processes. The Garda Press Office is also quoted as stating that the trips would have been authorised by the officer in charge of the transport section in conjunction with the fleet manager. The Garda spokesman confirmed that the gardaí who travelled to Spain, Italy, Portugal and Manchester as guests of Advance Pit-Stop were &ldquo;on duty&rdquo; although Oliver Hanlon, the civilian fleet manager, had taken leave of absence for some trips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Members of An Garda Síochána must at all times act in a manner which is consistent with their public duty and with the public interest and their behaviour must be beyond reproach. The gardaí engaged in procurement activities and civilian managers who engage in such activities on behalf of the gardaí must never be seen to have a conflict of interest, nor should there be any suspicion that they might succumb to the blandishments of companies from which An Garda Síochána obtains supplies and does business. It is essential that offers of hospitality and travel from companies are not accepted in circumstances which could give rise to a conflict of interest or be perceived as improper.</P>
    <P>To date, no suggestion has been made that the purchases made by An Garda Síochána from Advance Pit-Stop should not have been made or that sums paid for tyres purchased were not agreed as a result of a competitive tendering process or for a price in excess of what other companies could offer. Serious questions must be asked, however, as to the reason one of the country's leading tyre suppliers, which over a number of years has secured a major tyre supply contract with the Garda Síochána, felt the need to spend an estimated £45,000 taking senior technical staff from the Garda transport section on the trips detailed. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should tell the House what he knows of these trips and what inquiries he has made to date with the Garda Commissioner about what occurred. On the face of it, these trips are questionable and highly inappropriate and raise serious issues about the motives and business morality of Advance Pit-Stop and about the judgment of the Garda members who participated in them.</P>
    <P>It is in the public interest that an inquiry be held into what occurred and that terms of reference be conferred on that inquiry to compel both the gardaí involved, the Garda civilian fleet manager and directors and employees of Advance Pit-Stop involved in the trips to explain these events and the relationship to the Garda procurement activities.</P>
    <P>This is not merely an internal Garda matter but a matter of considerable public concern. It is cause for the Garda Commissioner, in the context of what he knows about these matters to date, to consider whether those members of the Garda Síochána involved who are still attached to the transport section should, for the time being, be transferred to other duties or should continue their involvement with the transport division of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>It is not acceptable for a public servant to accept gifts directly or in the form of free or subsidised trips in circumstances where it might be perceived as capable of influencing that person in the performance of his or her duty. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, sets out the <Col N="559" /> parameters that should be followed. Under the Ethics in Public Office (Prescribed Public Body, Designated Directorships and Designated Positions in Public Bodies) Regulations of 1997, the Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and chief superintendents, as well as those superintendents in the area of supplies and equipment, finance, transport and housing, are prescribed as persons who occupy designated positions in a public body under the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 18 imposes a requirement to make returns on interests which could materially influence the person in or in relation to the performance of the functions of the position. In this regard, yesterday my Department was in touch with the Public Offices Commission and today the commission secretary has written formally to the Secretary General of my Department and the Garda Commissioner with a view to ascertaining whether there may be aspects of this matter which the Commission should examine.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that the question of travel arrangements for the Garda Síochána is dealt with by the Garda authorities and would not as a matter of routine be referred to my Department. Similarly, the maintenance of the Garda fleet including the purchase of tyres is dealt with by the Garda authorities and the Government Supplies Agency. My Department is not directly involved in the tendering or purchasing process in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> At this stage I am not in a position to comment on the veracity of the allegations other than to say that the company in question, along with several other tyre companies, supplies material for the Garda authorities. The matter is now being fully investigated and when the facts have been established, this House will be fully informed.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has already asked the chief superintendent to examine the matter and I will advise the House of the outcome of that investigation.</P>
    <P>This matter also warrants an external examination. I have discussed the matter with the Secretary General of my Department. He, in his capacity as accounting officer for the Garda Vote, has asked the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter and it commenced this work yesterday. He is also in discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General about arranging an independent examination of the matter from a financial control point of view.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence at this time of any impropriety in the procurement process. I also emphasise &ndash; and I have no doubt the House will agree &ndash; the importance of following fair procedures. Inquiries involving all matters raised by the newspaper article are in train and when I have further information, I will bring that information to the House.</P>

      <P>The health and safety of passengers and commuters on public transport systems is the <Col N="562" /> statutory responsibility of the companies providing such services. Section 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, states that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety or health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to public transport services operated by CIE, section 7 of the Transport Act, 1958, places a duty on the company to have &ldquo;due regard to safety of operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In relation to buses providing public transport services, the Road Traffic Act, 1961 requires that all such vehicles with more than eight passenger seats must have a public service vehicle licence issued by the Garda Commissioner. Prior to issuing such a licence and every 12 months thereafter, the Garda authorities carry out an inspection of the vehicle to ensure it is suitable for the carriage of passengers. Such inspections are carried out with regard to national and EU regulations regarding safety. A similar inspection regime is carried out by Dublin Corporation with regard to public service vehicles with less than eight seats, that is, minibuses, taxis and hackneys. Before being issued with a road tax disc, buses undergo an annual road worthiness inspection in accordance with relevant EU requirements.</P>
      <P>The railway inspecting officers of my Department routinely inspect new railway infrastructural works and new rolling stock prior to commissioning. They carried out a number of inspections of the extended DART line to Malahide and Greystones before those services commenced and of the new rolling stock introduced on DART services in recent months.</P>
      <P>The railway inspecting officers regularly travel at peak times on the DART and Arrow services and any safety issues which they notice are followed up with Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-binding heads of agreement signed in July 2000 by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, and Tosco Corporation include a commitment by the latter to operate, and invest in the development of, the Whitegate refinery and the Bantry oil terminal on a commercial basis for at least 15 years after the date of purchase. I regard this commitment as an <Col N="563" /> essential element in the overall proposal, given the important contribution that these facilities make to ensuring security and diversity of oil supply in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall effort to bring the proposed deal to completion, work is proceeding on the translation of the 15-year commitment into an effective and enforceable legal undertaking. As these negotiations are still in progress, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I am not yet in a position to give details of the precise terms in which this or any other element in the deal will be reflected in the eventual agreement between the parties.</P>
      <P>Even if the proposed transfer of ownership proceeds, this will not diminish the extensive powers conferred on me by the Fuels Acts, 1971 and 1982, to deal with interruptions in Irish oil supplies. This legislation empowers me in such circumstances to regulate or control the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of oil and to take any measures necessary for the maintenance and provision of oil supplies. The facilities at Whitegate and Bantry will continue to come within the scope of this legislation, irrespective of their proposed transfer to the private sector.</P>
      <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, although a subsidiary of INPC, is not involved in the proposed deal with the Tosco Corporation and will continue to act as my agent in maintaining Ireland's strategic oil stocks. The NORA stocks may be utilised in the event of an internal or external oil crisis in accordance with agreed international procedures.</P>
      <P>In the context that the proposed deal between the INPC and Tosco is concluded, NORA will enter into commercial contractual arrangements in respect of the storage of strategic stocks at both Whitegate and Bantry. The refinery and the terminal will also continue to participate in the informal arrangements which, under the co-ordination of my Department, have provided an effective means up to now in dealing with localised disruptions, or threatened disruptions, of Ireland's oil supply arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Aer Rianta that it does not have car parks located in the red zones at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>The essential purpose of the so-called red zones at airports is to control the erection of buildings within those zones which by their height may interfere with the safe take-off or landing of aircraft. The red zones are delineated by the Irish Aviation Authority on the basis of standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO. The Irish Aviation Authority decides by reference to the red zones whether it wishes to object to any particular development proposal in the vicinity of an airport being considered by the relevant planning authority.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has recently commissioned consultants, Environmental Resources Management Ireland Limited, to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The consultants have been asked to outline the areas within which development may need to be restricted on public safety grounds and to make recommendations about the appropriate types of development within those areas. The consultants held an information day for the public on Tuesday, 6 February at the Skylon Hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that these public safety zones, which may differ in extent from the so-called red zones, will be incorporated by the Fingal planning authority into its land use plans. In due course, the intention also is that such public safety zones will be developed for use by the other local plan<Col N="565" /> ning authorities in whose areas airports are operating.</P>

      <P>In preparation for full competition, the ESB has been in detailed negotiation with its unions on a further major round of change in the company. In that context, the company last year presented me with proposals for a new voluntary severance scheme designed to achieve a further 2,000 voluntary staff exits over the next three years and I gave approval for that package on 3 November 2000.</P>
      <P>The new ESB voluntary redundancy scheme is similar to that which was available previously to ESB staff under the cost and competitiveness review, CCR. The package was and remains the most generous in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new round of change in the ESB and the associated voluntary severance package derive from the tripartite agreement between my Department and ESB management and unions, published on 17 February 2000, which sets out a new milestone framework for the future electricity industry in Ireland. That agreement provides for the progressive opening of the electricity market to full competition from 2005. The tripartite agreement correctly anticipates the further proposals which were recently signalled by the <Col N="566" /> European Commission for the full opening of the EU gas and electricity markets by 2005.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to Dáil Question No. 293 on 30 January 2001, my Department will continue to give careful consideration to the issue of Aer Rianta's corporate future. The issues involved are complex and the options for the future of the company should also have regard to developments generally in the airport sector in Europe and elsewhere. I remain of the view that a minority IPO may be the best option to address Aer Rianta's funding needs in the medium and long-term, but I am conscious that there are policy aspects to that option upon which other Ministers and I need to reflect carefully.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Regulation Bill passed all Stages in this House on Wednesday last, 7 February, and is scheduled for Report and Final Stages in the Seanad tomorrow, 14 February 2001. The framework for independent regulation of airport charges which will rapidly proceed following enactment of that Bill will help to clarify the policy debate, since airport charges have been an issue in that debate.</P>
      <P>As I said in response to the earlier question, my main concern in relation to whatever strategy is decided upon for Aer Rianta is that it is the correct strategy, not just for the company itself and its employees, but also for the users of the State airports.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 49 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has produced a report entitled Energy Demand to 2015. This was circulated to interested parties, though not formally published, on 22 December 2000 as ESRI Working Paper 136.</P>
      <P>In the period 2000 to 2005, the ESRI project that gas demand will grow between 6.9% and 9.8%. This reflects a high rate of economic growth, growth in the number of households, the competitiveness of gas in the domestic and industrial sectors and the likelihood that nearly all new power generation will be gas fired.</P>
      <P>BGÉ have produced their own projections for peak day gas demand, based on the ESRI's projections for annual gas demand, and compared these projected peak demands to the supply capacity likely to be available. They identified a number of uncertainties, including the level of demand and the amount of gas likely to be supplied from indigenous sources, which made it difficult to predict with any precision the likely balance between demand and supply in future years. However, they concluded that, in the absence of any additional measures to limit the growth in demand or to increase supply capacity, there was a substantial risk of shortfalls in supply capacity from the winter of 2002 onwards. The implications of this have been considered by Government which today gave approval in principle for a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to facilitate and encourage a wide range of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services to and from airports in Ireland in the interest of Irish trade, industry and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under European air transport liberalisation measures, any air carrier licensed by a European Economic Area &ndash; the 15 member states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland &ndash; may introduce air services on any route within the EEA without any government or EU con<Col N="569" /> trols, subject only to the availability of airport slots at either end of the route and, of course, normal safety requirements. As a result the provision of air services on any particular route is essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of the individual airline.</P>
    <P>Jersey European Airlines provided a direct Cork-Belfast city air service from May 1998 until June 2000. That particular service ceased because it did not prove commercially viable. Aer Rianta informs me that discussions are ongoing with a number of carriers and it is reasonably hopeful to have a direct service re-established in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Question No. 53 and Question No. 83 together.</P>
      <P>I should clarify at the outset that, in recent correspondence between myself or my Department with Ryanair, I did not reject the concept of an independently financed and operated terminal at Dublin Airport to compete with Aer Rianta's terminal facilities.</P>
      <P>There are a number of complex considerations involved and my Department has had consultancy advice on more than one occasion in recent years on the matter. In general, the thrust of that advice was against the concept of an independently owned terminal operating in competition with Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>I believe that if this concept were to be endorsed by this or any future Government, it would call for an open and transparent process in which proposals would be invited from any interested parties and assessed strictly on their merits.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides a detailed strategy for the enhancement of suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area. The quadrupling of the rail track, including upgrading of signalling, between Hazelhatch and Sallins, will enable the separation of long distance and suburban trains on the Kildare line and is identified as a priority project within this strategy.</P>
      <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that consultants have been commissioned by them to advance the design work on this project. An upgraded Kildare to Heuston rail corridor will be able to provide up to six express and six suburban train &ldquo;paths&rdquo; per hour. This will very significantly upgrade the level of service provided to commuters in the Kildare area.</P>
      <P>Sixty new diesel railcars have been ordered for delivery in 2002-03 to provide for enhanced suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area generally. A further 20 diesel railcars have been ordered for delivery in 2003, bringing the total on order to 80.</P>
      <P>The delivery of new diesel railcars and planned track development will enhance commuter rail services on the Kildare line, including services to Athy and Monasterevin. Plans are also well in hand to reopen Monasterevin station with work due to commence shortly.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) Strategy 2000 &ndash; 2016 entitled &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo; noted that, based on the last detailed survey carried out in 1997, a total of 249,000 person trips occurred in the a.m. peak hour in the greater Dublin area. Of this total, public transport accounted for 68,000 person trips or 27% of all trips.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 makes provision for a very significant investment in the capacity of the public transport network in the short-term. This investment is essentially focused on developing, extending and increasing the capacity of the bus network; implementing the light rail network approved by Government in 1998; and enhancing the capacity of the suburban rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTO forecast that by 2016, the demand in the peak hour will have increased to 488,000 person trips. With the improvements in the public transport system recommended in the strategy, together with the other elements of the strategy, including traffic management and demand management measures, the DTO estimate that the public transport system will cater for 63% of the demand or 308,000 person trips. The Dublin Transportation Office is currently preparing an implementation plan for the strategy and has set out a target of early March for the completion <Col N="573" /> of this work. This plan will then be the basis for Government decisions on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, sponsored by me, approximately 31% of the electricity market is now open to competition. This will rise to 40% in 2002 and to 100% in 2005. This means that any party can apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation &ndash; CER &ndash; for the necessary authorisations to build new plant and/or licences to generate and to supply eligible customers.</P>
      <P>The strong economic growth of recent years is reflected in high levels of growth in demand for electricity by all sectors of the economy. According to a report published by the CER, in conjunction with the ESB, entitled Generation Capacity Requirements to 2006, growth in demand for electricity is expected to average 4.4 % over the period 1998-2006. These levels of growth will require the provision of between 150 MW and 200 MW of additional capacity each year for the foreseeable future, by means of new plant or imports over the interconnector with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Extra tranches of power generation continue to be provided. In addition to the 160 MW unit which became operational at Poolbeg in April 2000, the new Fortum peat plant at Edenderry has in recent weeks added approximately 120 MW of capacity. On top of this, the ESB leased five 22 MW portable gas turbines in order to provide stand-by capacity at times of peak demand during winter 2000-01. The upgrading of the North-South electricity interconnector from 280 MW to 400 MW is proceeding according to plan and is on track for completion before the end of 2001. The 500 MW Moyle interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland is expected to come on stream around the second half of 2001, adding to overall system security.</P>
      <P>In respect of next winter, 2001-02, the CER is taking active steps to ensure that portable stand-by capacity will be available as required similar to this year. A number of power producers have well developed plans to build new gas fired generating plants. One such facility of 400 MW is currently under construction and a second plant of approximately 340 MW will shortly commence construction. Both of these will provide significant additional tranches of generating capacity in 2002-03, thus obviating the need for portable stand-by capacity in Winter 2002-03.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of applications to the CER to construct generating stations, and their status, can be found <Col N="574" /> on the commission's website at www.cer.ie. There continues to be a high level of interest on the part of potential entrants to the electricity generation industry.</P>

    <P>Twenty one redundancies were notified for the month of January 2001.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of the job losses for 1999 and 2000 were accounted for by redundancies in Fruit of the Loom International Limited as well as, to a lesser extent, in other companies such as Jaybee Limited. To offset the impact of job losses in Donegal and to establish it as a prime location for job creation, the Donegal County Develop<Col N="575" /> ment Board has been given responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Donegal employment initiative, which was presented to the Government on 14 July 1999. The board consists of representatives of all the industrial promotional agencies in the area as well as the elected representatives and the social partners.</P>
    <P>To date, it has been successful in providing a FÁS one-to-one quality registration interview with all redundant workers. Retraining to enhance employment prospects has been given to most of these workers as well as assistance in preparing CVs and in availing of job opportunities arising in the area and notified to FÁS. Arising from the report, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, the development agencies for which I have responsibility, have reorganised their Donegal based services.</P>

I have set up a task force on the prevention of workplace bullying which is operating under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit of the task force is to identify the size of the problem, to develop practical programmes and strategies to prevent workplace bullying and to produce a co-ordinated response from State agencies. The task force has com<Col N="576" /> missioned national research in order to fulfill its first remit. The task force is completing its work and I look forward to receiving its final report shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 to 71, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The preliminary figures released by IDA in the end of year statement in January 2001 stated that the total jobs created in the midlands region amounted to 6,098 jobs. This understated the actual position. The figure released omitted the employment figures of Continental AG who currently employ 110 people in Tullamore, consequently, the figures for the midland region should have shown the total employment in overseas companies in the five midlands counties as 6,208.</P>
      <P>The midlands region is therefore beginning to show recovery after a number of difficult years. In the year 2000, 569 new jobs were created by IDA assisted companies resulting in a net gain for the year of 105 jobs in IDA client companies in the region. The increase in employment reflects how IDA Ireland's strategy to secure 50% of all greenfield projects for the Border, Midlands and West regions is beginning to show results and this recovery will be more apparent as new projects, which have recently been announced, make their impact in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of industry in the regions. The development agencies are now <Col N="577" /> strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. Laoighis and Offaly form part of the BMW region which is a priority location for the IDA.</P>
    <P>On 5 February 2001 Enterprise Ireland launched a new regional development strategy, which sets out, <i>inter alia</i>, the basis of the agency's response to both the job losses experienced in the Laoighis-Offaly area and the under performance of the midlands region in recent years. This strategy highlights the strengths of the region, in particular the availability of skilled labour at a time of national skill shortages and the expertise available in, and from, the Athlone Institute of Technology. These are particularly attractive both to new start up companies and to expansion minded east coast companies which are experiencing staff shortages at their existing locations.</P>
    <P>In the case of start up companies, Enterprise Ireland recognises that there has been, in many parts of the midlands region, a low level of entrepreneurship and innovation particularly in those areas distant from third level institutions. In spite of this Enterprise Ireland has set itself the challenge of working in partnership with local communities to increase the number of high potential start ups in the midlands region within the overall regional strategy target of 50 new high potential start ups outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Initiatives which Enterprise Ireland will take include: targeting returning emigrants and Dublin based entrepreneurs and matching them with midlands locations; providing dedicated staff based in its midlands regional office in Athlone headed up by a regional director; facilitating the provision of suitable accommodation for start up companies.</P>
    <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has provided financial assistance towards the establishment of a number of community enterprise centres in the midlands region in recent years and these have made a big difference to the provision of high quality space for companies in locations outside the larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development's initiatives in the south west Offaly area include the Birr Technology Centre. This is a £2.4 million project which represents a major milestone for the incubation and growth of knowledge based industry in south Offaly. The centre will incorporate more than 23,000 square feet of high quality office space serviced with state of the art telecommunications and other facilities geared specifically towards business in the high growth services sector.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, closely monitors the measures taken by the Chinese Government against Falun Gong practitioners. We have expressed our concern about the situation and called on the Chinese authorities to respect the human rights of individuals. We have urged the Chinese authorities not to act against the principles contained in the UN covenants signed by China, in particular those relating to the freedoms of expression, assembly and associ<Col N="579" /> ation. We have also expressed concern about the number of arrests and the heavy sentences imposed on some members of the Falun Gong movement. At the general affairs council of 22-23 January, a number of decisions were taken concerning the EU-China human rights dialogue. Such dialogue is our preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in areas of concern and I see it remaining so in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to step up the dialogue, focus it better and assess it on a continuous basis. The specific areas in which the EU will be seeking progress through the dialogue process include respect for the exercise of the freedoms of expression, religion and belief, both public and private, and respect for the fundamental rights of all prisoners, including those arrested for membership of the political opposition, unofficial religious movements or other movements, such as the Falun Gong.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Falun Gong movement has nominated its founder for the Nobel peace prize. I am concerned, however, that this nomination will be perceived as having been put forward in a partisan spirit. It would be desirable for such nominations to be made on as objective and apposite grounds as possible.</P>

      <P>One of the principal responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs is the pursuance of Ireland's foreign policy objectives in the international arena. In that context a great number of international agreements covering a wide range of matters falls under the auspices of the Department and it must consider, on an ongoing basis, <Col N="580" /> the desirability of the State becoming a party to those agreements which it has not already ratified. It is also the case, however, that the subject matter of an international agreement may relate to the work of at least one other Department and the views of the latter must be considered fully before determining whether Ireland should ratify that agreement. In many cases it will be necessary to introduce domestic legislation or put in place new administrative arrangements to allow the State to meet its obligations under an international agreement. In some cases, an amendment to the Constitution may be required before we are in a position to meet these obligations.</P>
      <P>Given this large number and range of international agreements, the Deputy will understand that it would not be practical to furnish a full list of the details sought. However, if the Deputy has questions in relation to a particular agreement, or particular agreements, I will be happy to provide him with more detailed information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Torture is among the most abhorrent violations of human rights and, as such, is strictly condemned by international law. Freedom from torture is a right which is to be protected under all circumstances. Promotion and protection of this human right therefore deservedly is a priority of the EU's human rights policy.</P>
      <P>I have received and considered with interest a copy of Amnesty International's proposal for a comprehensive European Union policy on the eradication of torture, which includes a 12 point programme for the prevention of torture by agents of the state. I welcome the contribution which this paper has made and will continue to make to efforts to combat torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Common Foreign and Security Policy's human rights working group, COHOM, of which Ireland is an active member, is engaged in developing a position on guidelines on torture. The purpose of the guidelines would be to continue efforts to make the human rights dimension of the EU's foreign policy more operational. Any <Col N="581" /> guidelines on torture would be used to provide means and methods for achieving the human rights objectives of the EU's foreign policy. Addressing specific concerns about torture would be the primary purpose; however, the guidelines would also contribute to raising the EU's human rights profile in general.</P>
    <P>The Amnesty International paper is playing a very significant part in the efforts of the international community to put an end to incidences of torture by state and non-state agents alike.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to open a passport office in Galway. The reliability and efficiency of the passport service has improved significantly in recent years and there are now no delays in the issuing of passports. More than 94 per cent of all correctly completed applications received at the passport offices in Dublin and Cork are processed within ten working days. In addition, the localised nature of the passport express service available at more than 1,000 post offices throughout the State makes passports available more quickly and conveniently than previously. There is therefore no need now for applicants for passports, who apply in time, to call in person to a passport office.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe regarding the situation of gays and lesbians in Council of Europe member states are wideranging and comprehensive. The Assembly has recommended &ndash; Rec.1470/2000 &ndash; that legislation regarding criminal prosecution for homosexual acts between consenting adults be revoked, and that member states apply the same minimum age of consent for homosexual or heterosexual acts. Both of these recommendations have been complied with in Ireland by means of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences ) Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive statutory protection against discrimination has been put into place in Ireland in the form of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000. Discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is expressly prohibited in both Acts, which are now in full operation and are supported by both the <Col N="582" /> Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The Equality Authority has established an advisory committee on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people to advise the Equality Authority on equality strategies being pursued across Irish society.</P>
    <P>With regard to Recommendation 1474/2000 which deals with the position of gays and lesbians and their partners in respect of asylum and immigration in Council of Europe member states, it is possible for persons to claim refugee status in Ireland based on a well founded fear of persecution on the basis of their sexual orientation. Recommendations and decisions are made depending on the circumstances in each case.</P>
    <P>In relation to immigration policy, the current position is that Irish immigration law has no provision within it to deal with the admission of non-EU nationals who are in non-marital but <i>de facto</i> partnership with an Irish-EU national. This applies equally to heterosexual or same-sex partnerships. In practice, applications from persons in long-term <i>de facto</i> partnerships are examined on a case by case basis.</P>

    <P>With regard to the proposed development of a rail link to Dublin Airport, the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy 2000-2016, A Platform for Change, has recommended the development of a metro system for Dublin metropolitan area as part of an overall multi-modal public transport network. The strategy envisages that the recommended metro would provide the rail link to Dublin Airport. The Government approved, in principle, the development of the proposed metro.</P>
    <P>I have asked the light rail project office of CIE to carry out the necessary preparatory work on the development of the metro with a particular priority attaching to the rail link to the airport. I expect to report to Government shortly on the implementation plans.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, carries out a marine radioactivity monitoring and research programme throughout the year. The primary objective of the ongoing programme is to assess the exposure of the population resulting from radioactive contamination of the marine environment. The programme involves the routine sampling and testing of radioactivity in fish, shellfish, seaweed, sediments and seawater. The RPII publishes the results of its programme in a series of marine monitoring reports, which are also available on <Col N="584" /> the RPII's website &ndash; www.rpii.ie. The RPII also updates its website with data on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>Discharges of radioactive waste from the British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant at Sellafield continue to be the dominant source of radioactive contamination of the marine environment. Arising from its marine monitoring and research programme, it is the view of the RPII that the doses received by the Irish public through the consumption of seafood, walking on the beaches or engaging in any other marine-based activity are low and do not constitute a significant health risk.</P>
      <P>The continued contamination of the marine environment from the Sellafield plant is totally unacceptable and I am continuing to maintain the maximum pressure on the UK authorities for the cessation of radioactive discharges.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta funds its capital development programme at each of the three State airports, including Cork Airport, from its own resources without recourse to Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's current development plan for Cork Airport, costing in excess of £60 million, is proceeding. A number of engineering upgrades have already been carried out and the main runway has been overlaid and widened.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Aer Rianta that work will advance this year on the proposal to extend the terminal building at Cork. Within the next week or so, Aer Rianta will seek consultants to draw up design options for the terminal. This work is scheduled to be completed by July following which planning permission will be sought for the selected design. The works will then be put out to tender and assuming no delays in the planning process, Aer Rianta expect to have contractors on site in spring of next year.</P>
      <P>I would greatly prefer if construction work on the terminal in Cork could get under way before the end of the current year and I will be asking Aer Rianta to do everything possible to expedite their plans in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major extension to the apron at Cork is currently in progress. The provision of extra surface car parking and improvements to the internal road system will also proceed this year and commencement of a multi-storey car park with covered access to the terminal will follow upon <Col N="585" /> completion of major preliminary earthworks.

      <P>Eirgrid registered a new all time peak demand for electricity of 4000 on 16 January 2001. This represents an increase of 250 on the previous all time peak demand of 3750 recorded over a year ago in December 1999.</P>
      <P>I confirm again that the growth in demand for electricity and the power supply situation generally continues to be managed competently by ESB and Eirgrid and no power shortages have occurred. Incidents of limited localised power supply interruptions have occurred but these are not unusual and have been caused by storm damage or the accidental severing of cables by construction workers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The licensing of fixed and mobile telephony is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. According to a report published by the director in December 2000 there are now in excess of 70 operators licensed to provide services in the telecommunications sector, including three mobile network operators. Of these there are currently 46 active operators. The report estimates that new entrants' share of the fixed line market is in excess of 17%. The full automation of carrier pre-selection &ndash; CPS &ndash; since April 2000 has facilitated this competition, with over 120,000 business and residential subscriber lines using CPS in early autumn 2000. Eleven operators are now providing a mix of fixed line services including local, long distance and international calls to retail customers.</P>
      <P>With regard to mobile services there are currently two licensed operators Eircell and Esat Digifone providing services. The third licensed operator, Meteor, is due to commence the provision of services on 22 February. The total number of mobile subscribers was more than two million, reaching 54% of the total population before Christmas and with reports of an estimated 400,000 mobile phones purchased in Ireland in the run up to Christmas, penetration may exceed 60%.</P>
      <P>According to the ODTR prices for telecoms services have fallen dramatically over the past few years, but not by more than those of the leading OECD countries, with the exception of leased lines where competition and regulatory action is showing a distinct improvement in Ireland's relative position.</P>
      <P>A recent survey commissioned by the ODTR reveals that the SME sector believes the telecommunications market is more competitive and that as a result of that competition the overall cost of telecommunications has decreased. When asked if they believed the telecommunications market was more competitive than 12 months ago, 95% either agreed or agreed strongly. When asked if the overall cost of telecommunications has decreased in the last 12 months 85% either agreed or agreed strongly.</P>
      <P>As regards further mobile licences a competition for the award of the third generation mobile licences is expected to be launched by the ODTR in the near future.</P>

Two additional high capacity trains will be provided in the peak hour giving a 200% increase in passenger carrying capacity.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, of industrial relations difficulties regarding the extension of the suburban service on the Maynooth line. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that negotiations aimed at resolving these matters are currently in hand.</P>

      <P>Over the past two years, Bus Átha Cliath has taken delivery of a total of 440 new buses, comprising 165 replacement buses and 275 additional vehicles. Of these, 245 are wheelchair accessible, including all buses purchased in 2000.</P>
      <P>As regards Iarnród Éireann, significant additions to the rolling stock have been delivered over the past five years. These include the purchase of 14 train carriages for the enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line. Each of these carriages has a wheelchair accessible toilet and there are two designated wheelchair spaces per train set on the service.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company has purchased 64 diesel rail cars in the same period all of which are accessible to wheelchair users. Of these, 32 have a dedicated wheelchair accessible space and an accessible toilet and the 20 which have been purchased most recently also have on-board audio-visual facilities to assist hearing and visually impaired passengers.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has also brought into service an additional ten DART carriages with 16 more due to come into service at the end of April next. All of the DART carriages are wheelchair accessible while the recent additions to the fleet also have on-board audio-visual facilities.</P>
      <P>It is my policy as part of the national development plan that all transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them.</P>

    <P>In addition, 20 diesel rail cars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann recently. The company has ordered a further 80 diesel rail cars for delivery in 2002 and 2003. The additional DART cars and diesel rail cars will substantially increase capacity on the suburban rail network.</P>

To date approximately 19,000 cows have been slaughtered under the scheme. It is the intention to continue to take significant numbers of cows into the scheme. I have urged the beef processing industry to make the most effective possible use of the scheme so that its full benefits will be available to Irish farmers who wish to sell cows into the scheme over the coming months.

      <P>Since 1 September 2000, European Union regulations require operators or organisations involved in the production and marketing of beef to label it with the following information: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; the approval number of the deboning <Col N="590" /> hall and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements for the supervision of the production and marketing of beef have been extended to include the new compulsory beef labelling provisions. In other words, veterinary officers from my Department will ensure compliance with these labelling regulations in all export approved premises, local authority veterinary officials and environmental health officers will do the same with regard to domestic abattoirs and retail outlets respectively. The European Communities (Labelling of Beef and Beef Products) Regulations, 2000, were introduced by me last December to give legal effect to these controls.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement under the terms of both the 1994 early retirement scheme, as approved under Council Regulation (EEC) 2079/92, and the new scheme as approved under Council Regulation (EC) 1257/99, that the early retirement pension is paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension to which the participant in the scheme is, or becomes, entitled. Consequently the amount of any national retirement pension must be deducted from the early retirement pension. This requirement is included in the guidelines to the 1994 scheme and in the new scheme launched on 27 November 2000. As the matter is the subject of a specific provision in <Col N="591" /> the relevant EU Council regulations it is not one in which my Department has discretion.</P>

It is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way in the conduct or decision in any given court case.

      <P>There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new rural environment protection scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, under which the new scheme is implemented, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission has indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under the agri-environment title of Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, even as a State aid. Participants in the previous REP scheme who are currently in receipt of payment under supplementary measure five may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium on 27 animals under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme and for 24 beef cows and three heifers under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 31 May 2000. The person named had an outbreak of BSE in his herd in 2000 which obliged him to operate under a new herd number. His area aid application was lodged under his old herd No. G248-062 9 on 27 April 2000. However, his suckler cow and cattle headage claims were lodged under herd No. G248-129 9 and this gave rise to difficulties regarding the processing of the claims. An amount of £464.27 was paid to the person named under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme on 30 November 2000. Arrangements are now in place to issue the balance of his entitlement under this scheme as well as his full entitlement under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. Payment to the person named will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>The delay in payment was due to investigations in connection with the application under the REP scheme of the person named in Question No. 113. These investigations indicate that the person named is farming jointly with the other herdowner referred to in Question No. 114. In the circumstances my Department must treat their applications for sheep headage as a joint application. In so far as the new area based compensatory allowance scheme is concerned the herdowners may submit a joint application on their area aid application in 2001. Payment of outstanding sheep headage grants will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid under the previous scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension. While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three year scheme of compensation. During 2000, full com<Col N="595" /> pensation was paid to all participants in the scheme whose payments had been reduced during 1999.</P>
      <P>On 12 January 2001, the European Commission gave approval for payment of compensation in respect of reductions in payments during 2000. Compensation is set at 75% of the loss incurred and the total amount approved for Ireland is £2.63 million. One third of this will be funded by the EU and the remainder from the Exchequer. Arrangements for payment are being put in place following receipt of the Commission's approval. The compensation scheme provides for a third payment in respect of reductions in payments during 2001 and approval for this payment will be sought from the European Commission in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if a cross-Border co-operative can sell dry cow tubes or mastitis tubes to Northern Ireland based milk suppliers (details supplied); if not, the regulation under which this practice is prohibited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A retailer licensed under the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, may not lawfully sell any animal remedy, which definition includes dry cow tubes and mastitis tubes, to any destination outside of the State. No exception is made under this legislation for such sales made by a co-operative to its suppliers in another jurisdiction such as Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal basis for this prohibition is Regulation 31(6)(a)(iii) of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, which provides that the holder of a retail licence is prohibited from selling an animal remedy other than in accordance with the provisions of the marketing authorisation issued for the product. In the case of the products in question, the marketing authorisations are valid only in the State and in addition the mandatory route of supply on the packaging &ndash; licensed merchant &ndash; is valid only in the State. In Northern Ireland, such products are subject to supply only on veterinary prescription. Consequently, sales of such products to destinations outside the State would be in breach of the aforementioned legislation. While the question of any further offences which such sales might constitute in relation to <Col N="597" /> UK legislation is a matter for the authorities there, I would nonetheless add that I would expect that any responsible seller of animal remedies, be it a co-operative or otherwise, would not sell into another jurisdiction a product which is not authorised there and which may breach rules of that jurisdiction governing route of supply.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the products referred are also subject to further regulation under the Poisons Regulations, 1982, as amended, which legislation is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.   </P>

      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society &ndash; IRCS &ndash; who are administering the Government's humanitarian aid scheme for victims of severe flooding throughout the country in the period 5-7 November has completed its assessment of applications received from around the country. It must be emphasised the scheme is one of humanitarian aid to assist affected victims to get back on their feet and not compensation.</P>
      <P>The criteria used by the IRCS required claimants to prove hardship under one or more of the following headings to qualify for assistance: death; serious injury; homelessness; damage to home; loss of income; and extreme hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> Over 400 claims from 17 counties were assessed and the estimated cost of the scheme is £2.75 million, which includes payments as well as administrative and related costs incurred by the IRCS.</P>
    <P>The IRCS, which is now issuing payments under the humanitarian aid scheme, will compile and submit a detailed report to the Commissioners of Public Works accounting for all disbursement of the £2.75 million.</P>

      <P>I have no such plans. There are EU minimum rates of excise duty for diesel, kerosene and LPG used for industrial and commercial purposes. The EU Commission has proposed substantial increases in existing EU minima in its energy tax proposal.</P>

      <P>Where a disponer bequeaths an asset to a beneficiary for the beneficiary's lifetime only, such a transfer is considered an inheritance for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax &ndash; CAT. For example, the transfer of land to an individual for use during his or her lifetime. However, the legislation recognises the fact that such transfers are lifetime interests. Accordingly, in such cases, the value of the asset is reduced for CAT purposes depending on the beneficiary's age at the relevant date, that is, the death of the disponer or the valuation date if later. The value of the life interest is calculated by multiplying the value of the asset by the appropriate factor contained in column 3 or 4 of the following table &ndash; appendix 1 &ndash; which is appropriate to the age and sex of the person for the duration of whose life the interest is to be valued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Column 1 contains the age of the beneficiary, column 3 is the factor appropriate to a male of that age and column 4 is the factor appropriate to a female of that age. Column 2 is only relevant where there is a joint life interest. When the value of the life interest is calculated using the attached table, the normal CAT rules then apply to this amount. CAT is levied at a rate of 20% on the value of the inheritance in excess of the relevant exempt threshold. There are three exempt thresholds as follows: group I, £316,800, where the recipient is a child, or minor child of a deceased child, that is, certain grandchildren, this threshold <Col N="601" /> also applies to a parent where he or she takes an absolute inheritance on the death of a child; group II; £31,680, where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendent, other than those covered by class I; group III; £15,840, where the recipient does not fall within classes I or II, that is, non-lineal relations and strangers. Where a beneficiary has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988 under the same group threshold, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current liability to tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> There are various reliefs applying under the CAT legislation, including agricultural relief which may be relevant on the transfer of land. This relief operates by allowing the value of agricultural land, buildings, livestock and machinery to be reduced by 90% for the purposes of calculating the value for CAT. This 90% relief applies to agricultural assets received both by inheritance and gift. Agricultural relief applies only where the beneficiary's agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance are 80% or more of total assets.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> As the Deputy is aware, in budget 2001, I abolished probate tax in respect of deaths occurring on or after budget day, 6 December 2000. It is long-standing Government policy that any amendments introduced to tax legislation are not applied retrospectively. There must be some cut-off point. If retrospection was applied to any particular date to deal with hardship cases there would be further requests for it to be applied from an earlier date.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of estates where the death occurred before 6 December 2000 and where probate tax has not yet been paid, there is an existing provision in the legislation for deferral of the tax by the Revenue Commissioners in cases of hardship or where the estate is illiquid. This provision for hardship cases has applied since the introduction of probate tax.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the codes of practice in place to guide tax inspectors in applying rules under schedule E for allowable expenses which are deemed obligatory and expended wholly necessarily and exclusively in the performance of the duties of the job; and the rules which apply where performance of the job requires a worker to be away from base, such as for those involved in the air travel business, in respect of meals and sustenance.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3558/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the general rule in relation to expenses allowable under schedule E are contained in section 114, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the holder of an office or employment of profit is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments of the office or employment of profit expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of that office or employment, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of those duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments to be assessed the expenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The commentary from the Notes for Guidance of Inspectors reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The general rule as to the deductibility of expenses in computing the amount chargeable under Schedule E is that the expense must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the holder of an office or employment in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have issued leaflets on the tax treatment of payments by employers to employees covering reimbursement of motoring and subsistence expenses. These leaflets &ndash; IT51 for employees motoring expenses and IT54 for employees subsistence expenses &ndash; are available from the Revenue forms and leaflets service &ndash; telephone 01-8780100 &ndash; and are also available on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie. I have arranged for copies to be forwarded to the Deputy. These leaflets set out the circumstances in which an employer may make expenses payments to employees without the requirement to deduct tax. Where an employer does not make expenses payments in accordance with the schemes outlined in the leaflets, tax is deductible on the payments in the normal way and the individual may claim a deduction for expenses from his or her inspector of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that certain flat rate expenses have been agreed with a number of employee representative bodies. The agreed figures reflect the expenses that particular categories of employee are entitled to under the tax Acts on a year to year basis and lists are published periodically. The most up to date figures &ndash; 1999-2000 &ndash; were published in the Tax Briefing Supplement pub<Col N="606" /> lished in June 2000 and are also available for viewing on the Revenue website. Again, I have arranged for copies to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Flat rate expenses are also fixed from time to time for employees of particular companies in agreement with the local inspector of taxes. The availability of flat rate expenses removes the requirement for each individual employee to make a claim for expenses in each income tax year. However, it does not interfere with the rights of any employee to make a claim for expenses as provided in the income tax Acts with the consequential right of appeal to the appeal commissioners.</P>
    <P>In relation to the air travel business, the position regarding expenses is the same as for employees generally. I understand that a number of airlines have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners on the application of the expenses regime in their companies.</P>

      <P>A lone parent with a dependent child or children is entitled to a standard rate tax allowance of £4,700 in addition to the single person allowance of £4,700. The two allowances are equivalent to the married persons allowance of £9,400. If the annual income of a dependent child of a lone parent is more than £720, the lone parent allowance is reduced by £1 for every £1 by which the child's annual income exceeds £720.</P>
      <P>As of 6 April 2001, both the single persons allowance/tax credit and the lone parent allowance/tax credit will be increased by £800 to £5,500 at the standard rate.

    <P>It is not possible to ascertain precisely the extent to which employees who benefited in one year from the non-application of social insurance contributions to income exceeding the PRSI ceiling did so more than once, but the indicative information available suggests that most would have benefited over a number of years.</P>
    <P>As I have said in a recent reply on this topic, the &ldquo;PRSI holiday&rdquo; issue is of relevance only to the minority of employees, an estimated 13%, who will have annual earnings above the contribution ceiling of £28,250 which will apply from next April. When annual earnings are in excess of the relevant contribution ceiling, employees have a period in each contribution year in which no contribution is due; the duration of this period depends on the level of annual earnings and the point in the tax year at which the earnings ceiling is reached. Up to this, &lsquo;PRSI holidays' tended to be concentrated mainly in the first quarter of the calendar year in the lead up to the end of the tax year on 5 April.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Prior to the decision to align the tax and calendar years from January 2002, relevant employees could have expected a contribution holiday mainly in the first quarter of 2002. Arising from this alignment, their contribution holiday will be deferred until the final quarter of 2002. Leaving the contribution ceiling intact for the short calendar year does not impose any additional PRSI liability on the employees involved, as they will continue to have two &lsquo;PRSI holidays' over the two year period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002, as they would have had prior to the changeover, although the second holiday period will now mainly be in the final quarter of 2002. For those employees whose earnings exceed £28,250 in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001, no PRSI contributions will be payable from the point in the period the earnings ceiling is reached until 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>Most employees will benefit from a reduction of 0.5% to 4% in the contribution rate of PRSI, effective from 6 April 2001.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> The position is that those aged 65 and over are treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. Since coming into office, the exemption limits for the elderly have been increased by up to 85%. For those aged 65 and over, the exemption limits now stand at £8,500 single/£17,000 married. The tax exemption limit for married couples aged 65 or over at £17,000 (£327 per week) compares favourably with the general exemption limit of £8,200 for couples under 65.</P>
    <P>Where pensioners aged 65 and over are taxed under the normal personal allowance/tax credit system, they are eligible for the special age allowance in addition to the normal personal allowances. For couples aged over 65 the age allowance is currently £1,600 at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Pensioners will benefit from the general increases in the tax allowances-credits announced in budget 2001, i.e. the doubling of the PAYE allowance to £2,000 and the £1,600 increase in the married personal allowance to £11,000. The net effect of the improvements is that couples over 65 with one pension, who are within the normal tax allowance system, do not pay any tax on income up to £280 per week. It should be noted that the standard rate band for married one earners was increased in this budget to £29,000. Pensioners will also benefit from the substantial cuts in tax rates since this Government came into office. Prior to my 1998 budget the standard rate stood at 26% and the top rate at 48%. As of 6 April 2001, both these rates will have been cut by six percentage points, to 20% and 42% respectively.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the policy of widening of the standard rate band and putting it on a per person basis, which commenced in budget 2000, is designed primarily to meet the objective set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium that 80% of taxpayers should not pay tax at the higher rate. Given the move to the tax credit system this objective could only be realised by widening the standard rate band. The best way of achieving this objective was by restructuring the band so that persons are taxed on what they earn as individuals regardless of whether they are single or married. This policy will also make re-entering the work force more attractive for a non-earning spouse. As a result of the changes made in the band structure, the proportion of income earners on the higher rate will fall this year to 23% while the corresponding figure for taxpayers aged 65 and over is of the order of 16%. The widening of the standard rate band is one of the main elements of the substantial programme for tax reductions and reform which the Government has undertaken and does not lead to any taxpayer paying more tax.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness generally supports the Government's programme of tax reform. I would draw the Deputy's attention in particular to <Col N="613" /> section 1.1.4 relating to band widening which provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to proceed with the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers to secure the objectives which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also states that the Government will continue to review the income tax allowances and exemption limits for those over 65 years with a view to further assisting the position of the aged. The tax position of older people will be borne in mind in the context of budgetary planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate aim of drug misuse treatment policy is to return people to a drug free lifestyle. In the eastern region services have been greatly expanded in recent years and rehabilitation and after care is given a high priority. Rehabilitation co-ordinators are being appointed in the three area health boards of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in order to ensure that links are forged with relevant statutory, voluntary and community groups in developing rehabilitation initiatives.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives undertaken by local drugs task forces also involve rehabilitation. In conjunction with FÁS the national drugs strategy team has agreed the allocation of specific places in FÁS schemes for clients from local drugs task force areas.</P>
      <P>The Northern Area Health Board provides rehabilitation services directly at the Soilse project. It also supports the SAOL project for female drug misusers in the inner city. The Crinan Project in the inner city is also funded by the area health boards and by the drugs task forces. Funding is also provided for rehabilitation services at Merchant's Quay, Cuan Mhuire and Coolmine. Health board schemes closely link with the VEC, community employment schemes, FÁS and other back to work schemes in order to maximise the chances of drug misusers who are stabilised of getting employment and becoming socially reintegrated.</P>
      <P>Services outside Dublin have also expanded and developed in recent years. The regional health boards have drugs co-ordinators who link with the key players of all the relevant sectors such as health, education, voluntary and community groups and agencies such as FÁS. This assists in the delivery of a multi-disciplinary response to those with a drug problem. Counselling and support services are provided by the boards on a one to one basis and through group process by specially trained addiction counsellors. Residential rehabilitation facilities and after care are also provided through voluntary agencies, whose work complements that provided by statutory services and which are part funded by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pregnant drug using women are given high priority for treatment and special facilities are <Col N="616" /> provided at the drug treatment centre in Pearse Street. Health boards make every effort to encourage drug misusing mothers to attend for treatment and rehabilitation. A study carried out by the Health Research Board in 1999 showed that nine of the then 45 treatment facilities in the east provided crèche facilities. The report recommended that crèche facilities should be expanded and that further training on specific issues relevant to drug misusers should be provided to crèche workers. The three area health boards are working on the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board assists young mothers who wish to receive treatment by helping them access resources within the community and by facilitating their appointments on days and times to suit their family needs. While most other boards have no separate treatment programmes for women with young children each person accessing services is individually assessed and appropriate treatment is provided.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of more than £7 million has been provided to health boards in 2001 to enhance and develop their treatment and rehabilitation services and all boards have identified in their service plans a range of measures which will be implemented this year.</P>
    <P>A review of the national drug strategy was undertaken by my colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, Minister of State with responsibility for drugs at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, in 2000. I understand this will be published shortly and will make recommendations on future drug strategies. In addition, the work of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs will also help inform service providers of appropriate and effective treatment options for drug misusers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements introduced in June 1991 on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone regardless of income is eligible for in-patient services subject to statutory charges.</P>
      <P>These services may be provided directly by the health board in one of its own hospitals, or in another publicly funded hospital, or by way of a contracting out arrangement between the health board and a private institution. Alternatively, one can opt for private treatment &ndash; all persons, including medical card holders, who opt for private treatment are liable for any expenses they incur.</P>
      <P>Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay or extended care. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Persons with dependants are not liable for these charges. The legal basis for these charges is section 5 of the Health Act, 1947, which allows regulations to be made, and sections 51 and 53 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>Charges may also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, which allow for a charge towards the costs of in-patient services provided under section 52 of the Health Act, 1970, for a person with limited eligibility and without dependants who has been in receipt of in-patient services for 30 days.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the shortcomings in the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme highlighted in the Ombudsman's recently published report and a number of measures have already been taken to deal with some of these problems. However, I am advised that the legal position with regard to an individual's entitlement to in-patient services is not at all as straightforward as the report contends. In particular, the Health Act, 1970, as amended, distinguishes between eligibility and entitlement, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. To be eligible means that a person qualifies to avail of services either without charge &ndash; full eligibility &ndash; or subject to prescribed charges &ndash; limited eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Section 52 of the 1970 Act requires health boards to make available in-patient services for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility. However, the manner and extent to which in-patient services are to be made available and the nature and extent of the in-patient services to be provided are not specified. I am advised the nature of the obligation imposed on health boards to make available in-patient services is not such as to confer an entitlement on an individual in so far as this may be taken to mean a legally enforceable right capable of being enforced by mandatory order.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever further measures may be necessary arising from the findings of this review and the report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

I have had further inquiries made of the ERHA in this matter and have been advised that Beaumont Hospital called the patient concerned for admission for surgery in October 1999, but this date did not apparently suit her.</P>
      <P>The hospital has indicated that the patient's records will be reviewed by the consultant concerned with a view to rescheduling the surgery as soon as possible. I have asked the regional chief executive of the authority to revert to the Deputy when a date for surgery has been confirmed.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines, ex manufacture, in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &ndash; IPHA &ndash; formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &ndash; FICI &ndash; which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
      <P>Some considerable discrepancies can exist between the prices of individual products between Ireland and the UK, particularly if the comparison is made on the basis of generic equivalents. There is a vibrant generic market in the UK where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition that affects prices charged for generic medicines.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers of the product referred to by the Deputy notified my Department of their intention to introduce a 28 pack size. Bulk packs of the product, 100 pack and 1,000 pack sizes, are no longer available on the Irish market. The product concerned is imported from the UK and the change in pack size is in line with the UK patient pack initiative and the pricing is in line with the currency converted UK price.</P>
      <P>In view of the demand for and importance of this product, my Department deemed it appropriate to accept the revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has experienced difficulties in recent weeks in ensuring that there are adequate blood supplies available to meet all hospital requirements. To counter the current seasonal shortage in blood, the IBTS is conducting a major campaign through the media at national and local levels to advise of blood supply difficulties and to encourage more donors to come forward. Additional blood donor clinics have also been provided to facilitate donors. I am happy to report that donors have responded generously to this campaign and currently there are adequate supplies available to hospitals to meet both emergency and elective procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific information requested by the Deputy, my Department has asked the regional chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the chief executive officers of the health boards and the chief executive officers of voluntary hospitals outside the eastern region to investigate the position in their hospitals in respect of the period 25 January to 8 February 2001. The position is that only two health boards have advised my Department that operations were postponed due to shortage of blood. Two elective operations were cancelled in the North Western Health Board. In the Western Health Board region 38 elective operations were cancelled in Galway Regional Hospital, and five in Mayo General Hospital. No operations have been cancelled in the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, South Eastern and Southern Health Board regions. Full details are not yet available in respect of the ERHA, and I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it comes to hand.</P>
      <P>The IBTS maintain regular contact with health boards and voluntary hospitals in relation to blood supplies and during the period in question, 25 January to 8 February, informed them of difficulties in meeting their requirements for blood for elective surgery. Adequate supplies were maintained at all times for emergency procedures. Blood supplies for elective surgery were distributed in such a way that the shortage of available blood was spread evenly throughout the country. The IBTS is available to hospitals to discuss strategies on managing the impact of blood shortages, and have arranged to meet with staff in the Western Health Board on 26 February next for this purpose.</P>

      <Quest>if he has now received a full report on the situation whereby some batches of polio vaccine distributed here two years ago contained serum from a British donor who had recently been diagnosed as having variant CJD; and the communications which took place with the Irish Medical Organisation and general practitioners to inform the public of the situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3727/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The oral polio vaccine, opv, to which the Deputy refers was manufactured by Evans-Medeva in the UK and distributed for use in Ireland during the period 15 January 1998 to 30 January 1999. Seven batches of the vaccine consisting of 95,890 units were available for use over this period. On 13 December 2000 the Irish Medicines Board informed my Department that a constituent of the vaccine, namely, human serum albumin, HSA, utilised a blood donation in its manufacture from a UK resident who has recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, vCJD.</P>
      <P>HSA is a product which is made from human blood donations. It is a protein, albumin, obtained from blood serum, hence its name. It is used as a stabiliser in some medicinal products and vaccines. On receipt of the information relating to this vaccine from the IMB, I arranged to obtain expert advice from national and international experts in the field who advised on a wide range of aspects relating to this issue. Their advice indicated that the potential risk, if any, to recipients is essentially non-existent.</P>
      <P>This expert advice is based on a number of factors: the dilution factor involved in this case &ndash; the persons donation was one of 22,353 used to make a pool. This is turn was combined with another pool to give a final dilution of 1-63,866; the manufacturing process by which albumin &ndash; the agent used to stabilise the vaccine &ndash; is made from plasma involves a number of stages in the course of which any potential infectivity would be removed &ndash; in other words, no infectivity has been associated with albumin; the fact that polio vaccine is administered orally rather than by injection further reduces the theoretical possibility of transmission.</P>
      <P>The plasma donation involved in this incident was donated in 1996-97 and the individual concerned has only recently been diagnosed as having contracted the disease. It would not therefore have been possible at the time of this person's donation to &ldquo;screen it out&rdquo; on the basis that he or she might later develop CJD. While blood donations are screened for communicable diseases there are no tests which would enable donations to be screened for CJD or vCJD or which would allow doctors to establish whether an individual is at risk of contracting these diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department supplied background information, expert risk assessment and other data to health boards and to the Irish College of General Practitioners so that this could be circulated by <Col N="624" /> them to health professionals and others. The Irish Medical Organisation was contacted on 15 December 2000 and informed on a confidential basis about the issues and that a public announcement would be made the following week.</P>
    <P>Each health board was asked to establish a telephone line which parents could call if they wished to discuss any concerns about their child-children arising from their having received the vaccine in question. It also enabled reassurance about the level of risk involved to be given to parents.</P>
    <P>There was a high volume of calls to these lines in the days immediately following the announcement and therefore not all callers were able to get through immediately. Where details of the vaccine batch administered were not immediately available to the health board the parents were advised to contact their GP. Additional information was available on my Department's website and on the websites of the individual health boards and on that of the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>I and my Department greatly appreciate the efforts made by GPs in informing and reassuring parents following my public announcement. There was little opportunity for doctors to be briefed in advance of my announcement but this was inevitable given the urgency of making the information available in an organised and objective manner at the earliest possible opportunity. The proximity to Christmas was an added complication.</P>
    <P>Following the examination of vaccination records by general practitioners and health boards, information has come to light which indicates that vaccine from the batches referred to above was administered after its expiry date. At my Department's request, the health boards are currently conducting an examination of records to establish the extent to which the vaccine in question was used beyond its expiry date. I requested expert advice on this issue from the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland who have advised that the efficacy of the vaccine reduces if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Medicines Board on 17 January 2001 to discuss a range of issues relating to the circumstances surrounding its announcement of 13 December 2000. In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards are currently establishing a national immunisation steering committee which will address a range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>

      <P>Under article 12 of the Medical Preparations (Advertising) Regulations, 1993, a health professional, which includes doctors, shall not solicit or accept any inducement in the form of gifts, pecuniary advantages, or benefits in kind, unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine and pharmacy. In addition, a person providing hospitality to a health professional in the course of sales promotion shall ensure that such hospitality is reasonable in level and secondary to the main purpose of the meeting and that it is not extended to other than health professionals.</P>
      <P>In support of these regulations the pharmaceutical industry was required to introduce the code of marketing practice in consultation with my Department and other interested parties with a view to securing the universal acceptance and adoption of high standards of conduct in the marketing of medicinal products designed for use under medical supervision.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1993 the advertising of medicinal products for human use in the European Community member states, has been governed by Council Directive 92/28/EEC of 31 March 1992. The code of practice fits into the general framework established by article 12 paragraph 4 of the directive, which recognises the role of voluntary control of advertising of medicinal products by self regulatory bodies and recourse to such bodies.</P>
      <P>This code was approved by my Department under article 16.2 of the Medical Preparations (Advertising) Regulations 1993, (S.I. No. 76 of 1993) for the purposes of providing practical guidance in implementing the regulations. Compliance with the advertising regulations is now one of the general conditions applicable to the holding of product authorisations.</P>
      <P>The code emphasises the importance of providing health professionals with accurate, fair and objective information about medicinal products so that rational decisions can be made as to their use. In addition, the code accepts the principle that such information should be presented in a form and by ways and means which conform not only to legal requirements but also to professional standards of ethics and good taste.</P>
      <P>Acceptance and observance of the provisions of the code are a condition of membership of the pharmaceutical division of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. Companies observing the code also acknowledge that its provisions are to be applied in the spirit, as well as in the letter.</P>

      <P>The Second Schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 of the regulations states that &ldquo;a health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person if it was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, <Col N="627" /> disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the regulations set out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000 or more and is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenace allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension, or old age non-contributory pension and the person's income is greater than £5,000 per annum. My Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the nursing home regulations, including a review of the value of the principal residence for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990 impose strict regulatory controls on the conducting of clinical trials in Ireland. Under these Acts a person who proposes to arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial must make application to the Irish Medicines Board for permission. Every such application must be accompanied by the name, address and description of the applicant; sufficient information to enable a scientific evaluation to be made of the <Col N="629" /> proposed clinical trial and of the substance or preparation which it is proposed to administer in the course of that trial; the identity, which includes the qualifications of each member, of the ethics committee; the name, address and qualifications of each person who would conduct the clinical trial; the criteria to be used for the recruitment and the selection of participants; details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or being a participant; such further information, evidence, documents, samples and other materials as may be necessary to indicate the nature of the trial; and the appropriate fee, if any, specified by the Minister by virtue of section 16 of the Act.</P>
      <P>In addition, the approval of the appropriate ethics committee for the trial must also be obtained. Under the Acts it is incumbent on the applicant in making application to identify the proposed ethics committees and to provide the names, addresses and qualifications of each member. Guidelines prepared by my Department on the implementation of the Acts require that in determining the membership of ethics committees the following principles should apply: committees must command the technical competence and judgment to attempt to reconcile the physical and psychological consequences of participation with both the welfare of the participants and the objectives of the investigation and they should also, with advantage, accommodate respected lay opinion in a manner that provides effective representation of community as well as medical interests.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also recommend that the membership should, as far as possible, include both sexes and comprise both lay and medical members. The following was proposed as the minimum membership for an ethics committee:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)Medical</P>
      <P>Three medical practitioners, at least one of whom should be independent of the institution in which the study is to be considered and one, at least, who should be personally familiar with the conduct of clinical trials generally. In the event of a practitioner being personally involved in the study to be conducted, that fact should be disclosed to the other members of the Committee and there should be a sufficient number of other practitioners who are not so involved in order to maintain a balance.</P>
      <P>(ii)Paramedical</P>
      <P>A person actively involved in patient care.</P>
      <P>(iii)One professional non-medical person who is involved in administration or business.</P>
      <P>(iv)One person with legal experience.</P>
      <P>(v)One member of the lay public whose competence and integrity the public could be expected to respect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> It was also indicated that the committee should be of a manageable size, less than 12, and that it should elect its own chairman.</P>
    <P>The above guidelines and recommendations were continued by the Irish Medicines Board when in 1996 the board took over responsibility for the granting of permissions for the conduct of clinical trials. The Irish Medicines Board has also published guidelines titled Guidelines for Applications for Clinical Trial Investigations of Medicinal Products for Human Use.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board in its examination of applications for permissions also takes into account the appropriateness of the proposed ethics committee and of its proposed composition. Where the board is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee is competent to &ldquo;consider the justification for conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances under which it is to be conducted&rdquo;, it gives its approval for the proposed committee.</P>
    <P>The number of ethics committees equate with the number of clinical trials carried out. In practice the membership of the ethics committees may often be identical with the membership of the ethics committees of the various institutions where the trials are being carried out.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that having regard to the procedure for the appointment of ethics committees as outlined above neither the numbers of such committees nor the names of the members of the committees would be readily available.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent report concerning food safety compliance in domestic abattoirs; and the action the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is taking to protect consumer health.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3859/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent publication of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's, Update on Ongoing Audit of Compliance with the SRM (Specified Risk Material) Regulations at Irish Meat Premises (January 2001). As part of this audit, which included domestic and export approved abattoirs as well as butcher outlets, the FSAI found 29 of these abattoirs to be non-compliant.</P>
      <P>The FSAI noted that 96% of the animals slaughtered at the domestic abattoirs were under 36 months of age. Legislative controls on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle in Ireland were stringent by 1996 and early 1997, therefore, these animals would not have had access to contaminated meat and bone meal. While these animals pose a reduced level of risk, the removal of SRM from all animals over 12 months is an EU requirement and 100% compliance is required in all abattoirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> On foot of the findings arising from this audit, the FSAI is involved in a variety of actions aimed at protecting consumer health. These actions include the following: when non-compliant abattoirs were found during the conduct of the audit these were dealt with immediately by means of a closure order or an improvement notice, depending on the circumstances. Under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, under an improvement notice, a proprietor must identify the activity giving rise to the risk and is required to take remedial action within a specified time limit. All abattoirs found to be non-compliant during the audit are now compliant or alternatively remain closed.</P>
    <P>The findings of the audit have been brought to the attention of all abattoir owners by means of a series of mailings and a general meeting held with abattoir owners. The findings have also been widely publicised in the media. The FSAI has held a number of training meetings with local authority veterinary inspectors, charged with the inspection of these abattoirs. A specific advice sheet has been sent to all abattoirs &ndash; domestic and export &ndash; outlining precisely the requirements for dealing with SRM. The retail and wholesale meat trade has also been contacted in this regard. The FSAI is involved with University College Cork in facilitating a specific training programme for local authority abattoir operatives. The authority is currently involved with the veterinary inspectors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the local authorities veterinary service as well as the meat trade, in developing a quality manual for the operation of red meat abattoirs. This manual will deal with SRM issues and broader hygiene issues. This audit is ongoing and the FSAI intends to issue updates on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <P>As the provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the ERHA, I have asked the chief executive officer of the ERHA to investigate the position in relation to this case and to reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. As part of the initiative recently announced, the Department approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be <Col N="632" /> given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the authority's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the authority's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The group has set a target date of 1 April this year for the implementation of the pilot scheme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy and I can understand the extreme distress which the person concerned is experiencing as a consequence of the outcome of her surgery. The surgery was performed at a clinic which is not part of the public health services. In cases where a person is dissatisfied with the services provided by such a clinic, it is open to that person to seek redress through civil law or, if a medical practitioner is involved, to make a complaint to the Medical Council. The council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Doctors are required to be registered with the council to practice medicine in Ireland. The Act is currently under review. Among the proposals being considered are greater public representation on the council and a more open and responsive approach to dealing with complaints against doctors and arrangements for periodic competence assurance.</P>

    </P>
    <P>A national study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population which was completed last year indicated that Ireland has a very low endemicity for hepatitis B, approximately one in 200 of the population, which is much lower than that found in other low endemicity northern European countries. The authors of the study concluded that the current national hepatitis B immunisation policy, that is, selective immunisation of high risk individuals, is appropriate at present and recommend that it continue.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy on immunisations is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. In its latest guidelines the committee states that, despite evidence of undernotification examination of the recent epidemiological data in Ireland indicates a low prevalence of hepatitis B, in line with other northern European countries. Immunisation is, therefore, recommended only for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors, for example, close contact with a case or carrier. The committee states that it will continue to review the policy on hepatitis B immunisation in the light of changing epidemiological data and evidence of the effectiveness of delivery of immunisation against this disease.</P>

      <P>I have asked the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board to supply the information requested, on the number of vacant posts for speech therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and clinical psychologists in each community care area within the board, directly to the Deputy. On the wider issue of vacancies in the therapy grades, my Department engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, progress has been made in increasing the number of training places from October 2000 for the following therapies: speech and language therapy, eight places; physiotherapy, 52 places; occupational therapy, five places. An additional 30 training places have been created in clinical psychology within recent months, and talks are ongoing with university heads of psychology with the aim of increasing this number further from October 2001. I am committed to taking all appropriate steps to promote the recruitment and retention of health service staff.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. It is the intention to increase these rates to £90, £120 and £150 with effect from 1 April next.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy is referring to top up payments it is assumed he is referring to the provision in the regulations whereby a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of maternity services at Dundalk County Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board. The report of the review group on maternity services in the North Eastern Health Board which was completed in November last recommended that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk should cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services should be established in Dundalk; and consultant-led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan. I have been advised that the health board decided not to &ldquo;accept in full the recommendations&rdquo; in the review group's report and that it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit. This further review will reflect on the potential for cross-Border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning as anticipated in the national development plan. It is proposed that the board will finalise plans for this review at its next monthly meeting which, I understand, will take place on Thursday, 15 February 2001.</P>
      <P>At the request of the board, I met the chairman and members of the board on 30 January 2001 and I wrote to the chairman of the board on 5 February. In my letter I expressed my firm view that the way forward for maternity services is about putting in place services which comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice and emphasised the need to ensure patient and staff safety. I also stated that it was imperative that the board establish and finalise a clear view on what services will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services requiring to be developed and the enhancement of existing services in the light of the £160 million NDP funding which has been notified to the board. I look forward to receiving the board's proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also been advised that at a special meeting on 5 February the board further considered the question of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk. In order to avoid the suspension of maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk, the board mandated the chief executive officer to seek, as a matter of urgency, approval for the appointment of temporary consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath Hospital Groups to facilitate the continuation of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk and to seek, in addition, approval for the immediate appointment of onsite paediatric cover at both hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of additional temporary consultant medical posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, as the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts. My Department will have appropriate discussions with the board regarding funding for any <Col N="639" /> such temporary posts which Comhairle may approve.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance cover is an issue for the board and its insurers, who have a contractual relationship in this matter. I have not consulted the board's insurers regarding insurance cover.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in September 1999, addressed the particular issue raised by the Deputy. It outlined proposals in relation to the introduction of lifetime community rating and open enrolment, which will address, <i>inter alia</i>, the situation of individuals who seek access to community-rated private health insurance cover when they are of or over the age of 65. The White Paper provided that the existing open enrolment provisions, which set out the basis for regulating access to cover, would be extended to such persons who could previously be refused cover if they were entering private health insurance for the first time or their previous cover had lapsed for a material period.</P>
      <P>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which was published on 30 June, includes provision for the extension of open enrolment to persons of or over the age of 65, together with other provisions contained in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>While there continues to be some controversy and discussion regarding a possible link between emissions from mobile phones and adverse health the balance of scientific evidence to date does not indicate a definite link. I am advised that the specific absorption rate &ndash; SAR &ndash; measures the amount of radio frequency emissions absorbed by human tissue while using a mobile phone. Mobile phones available for sale in EU member states comply with EU recommendations on exposures. Following an EU recommendation in 1999, the EU electrical standards body prepared a standard procedure for measuring SARs from mobile phones. Details of SAR emissions from all phones currently on sale in the EU should begin to become available by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may at the time of registration, or subsequently, impose conditions in relation to registration. The regulations provide for periodic inspections at least once every six months by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, in the North Eastern Health Board is a matter for the board itself. The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of homes and number of inspections is not, as a matter of course, retained in my Department.</P>

      <P>A maximum permitted Commission recommendation on the blood alcohol content &ndash; BAC &ndash; for drivers of motorised vehicles was addressed to member states in January 2001. This sets out the Commission's position on a range of matters relevant to alcohol impaired driving, including the recommendation that all member states should adopt a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 mg per ml of blood or lower. It is envisaged that the Transport Council will respond to this Commission recommendation and this process is now being addressed by COREPER.</P>
      <P>The Irish position on this matter will be based on the principles set out in the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. These recognise the relatively recent introduction of the 80 milligram blood alcohol limit in Ireland and the consequent priority to improve compliance with this requirement rather than to move to new limits. The strategy also stated that the Government would follow the progress of developments internationally, as well as progress towards relevant national road safety targets, in considering the adequacy of the present 80mg limit in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It has not been practicable to provide for a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, in recognition of the need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi licence has been fixed at £100, with a £5,000 fee for ordinary taxi licences. I have put on record my intention that by end 2003 the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible. This period of notice has been carefully considered and I do not propose to amend it.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to progressing a number of mitigating measures for certain taxi licence holders, including a proposed tax relief by way of capital allowances for the actual capital cost of the licence, and an administrative scheme to address high licensing fees paid to certain local authorities. My Department will issue instructions to licensing authorities on the latter measure very shortly.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's policy in introducing the new regime for taxi licences, it was announced that existing taxi owners as of 21 November 2000, would be able to write off the actual cost to them of these licences as a capital allowance. In this regard, the Finance Bill, 2001, preliminary list of measures announced on 26 January 2001 provides: a write off period of five years in line with the new write off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery; the commencement of the write-off period for taxi licences to be backdated for three years to 21 November 1997; that the write-off will be allowed against the trading income of the licence owner who drives a taxi and against both the trading and rental income only where one licensed vehicle driven by the licence owner is also rented out on a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>The 1982 report of the Stardust tribunal made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters. All these recommendations have received full and careful consideration and have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services over the intervening period. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, training, the legislative framework and emergency planning. I am satisfied that these improvements have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>
      <P>Section 26 plans deal with the organisation, equipment, training and other operational matters required for fire and other emergency situations. Twenty three fire authorities have submitted plans. A further seven fire authorities have prepared, but not yet adopted, plans. The remaining three fire authorities have yet to prepare plans.</P>
      <P>Section 26 plans should not be confused with the major emergency plans which all authorities have prepared and keep updated. These set out the arrangements for mobilising and co-ordinating the emergency response to any event which causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property on a scale beyond the normal capabilities of the Garda, local authorities and health services.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02, announced last July.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recently published the findings of an independent evaluation of the back to work allowance scheme which was carried out by Indecon International Economic Consultants. The back to work allowance scheme supports long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities in going back to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment. Since it commenced in late 1993, almost 80,000 people have availed of the scheme. At present there are approximately 39,000 participants with almost half of these engaged in a wide variety of self employment projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report follows extensive research, including a survey of people who have participated in <Col N="652" /> the scheme. A postal survey of employers was also carried out and consultations took place with interested organisations such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed.</P>
    <P>The evaluation was focused primarily on persons who had ceased to receive payments under the scheme because their three or four year cycle of support had ended or because they had left the scheme prematurely. In summary, it found that the scheme was largely achieving its objectives of providing an incentive by way of financial support to the long-term unemployed to encourage them to return to work.</P>
    <P>The consultants found that the scheme was affected by problems of dead-weight in that many of those benefiting under the scheme would have re-entered the labour market even in the absence of the scheme. The report accordingly recommends, in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been highly successful since its implementation and has provided a route out of unemployment for significant numbers of long-term unemployed persons. I am happy that the scheme still has a significant role to play in assisting people who are still on the live register and other groups of welfare recipients such as people with disabilities, lone parents and carers to re-enter the world of work.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the recommendations in the report concerning an increased level of training, advice, support and mentoring for those participating in the scheme. In this context I will shortly be introducing a code of practice aimed at employers, participants and the Department as recommended in the report. I have also set aside £250,000 to help persons entering self employment under the scheme with the cost of public liability insurance and last year I provided an extra £250,000 to the First Step organisation to help that organisation expand its programme of interest free loans to self employed participants in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The report will form the basis for future developments of the scheme and will help my Department ensure that it reflects the needs of the labour market and also the needs of the client groups at whom it is targeted. It is my intention to consult the social partners about the report and its findings and recommendations with a view to agreeing a consensus approach to the future development of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a carer's allowance on 26 May 2000. At the time of her application she was a qualified adult on her spouse's back to work allowance. She was awarded a personal rate carer's allowance of £14.50 per week with an increase of £33 per week child dependant allowance, with effect from 1 June 2000. She has decided, however, to remain as a qualified adult on her spouse's back to work allowance as this is financially more beneficial to her.

      <P>Arising from the improvements I have introduced to the carer's allowance means test in the context of budget 2001, the person concerned will qualify for a personal rate of carer's allowance amounting to £64.50 per week and £33 dependant child allowance with effect from 5 April 2001. From this date, carer's allowance will be payable to her from that date as it will be financially more beneficial to her.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor the Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has a total weekly income of £101.10 &ndash; Department of Social Security pension of £59.60 plus a reduced disability allowance payment of £41.50. The SWA rate for a single person is currently £76 per week. The person, therefore, has weekly means of £25.10 in excess of the SWA rate which they are required to contribute towards their rent in addition to the £6 minimum contribution. The total contribution <Col N="654" /> which must be made towards rent is £31.10 per week &ndash; £25.10 plus £6. While the person has a weekly rent of £50, the maximum rent payable for a single person in shared accommodation in the Western Health Board area is £40 per week. The person is, therefore, in receipt of the appropriate weekly rent supplement of £8.90 &ndash; £40 less personal contribution of £31.10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's benefit scheme is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment which is operated and paid by my Department. This is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period, which is a key feature of the scheme. Legislation to guarantee these rights has been brought forward by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and is currently being debated in this House.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for carer's benefit, all of the qualifying conditions must be satisfied on or after 26 October 2000. This also applies to the condition that the applicant must have been in remunerative employment for the previous three month period on a full-time basis. As is the case in all new schemes, certain people may have qualified if the scheme had been introduced at an earlier date. It is difficult to decide on past entitlements in these type of cases.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has introduced some flexibility to facilitate those employees who had already left the workplace before the commencement date. In this regard, employees who were on annual leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave or term-time leave immediately prior to their application will be eligible for carer's benefit and the three month remunerative employment period to be assessed will be the period prior to that leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, carers who took special or compassionate leave or a career break prior to the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme for the purpose of caring and with the agreement of their employer, may apply for carer's benefit. Certification of the caring situation will be required from the carer's employer and the care recipient's <Col N="655" /> doctor. In such cases, a maximum period of six months prior to the introduction of carer's benefit application will be disregarded and the three months prior to that six-month period will be assessed for the purposes of carer's benefit. I have received two letters regarding this issue since the scheme commenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met a group representing both the retired personnel and staff associations of this company in October last. At that meeting a number of issues, including that referred to in the question, were discussed. I should also point out that the association has written to me on a number of occasions regarding this issue. The issue here relates to integration, a common feature of occupational pension schemes whereby the occupational pension takes account of the social welfare pension being received by the pensioner, so that the occupational pension effectively tops up the social welfare pension to provide the total pension specified in the rules of the pension scheme. The members of the association are dissatisfied at the way in which their employer's pension scheme operates integration in the case of early retirees from the company.</P>
      <P>However, the arrangement being used by the trustees would have been agreed when the pensions scheme was originally set up and there is no breach of the Pensions Act. Therefore, as I indicated to the association at our meeting, I cannot become involved in what is essentially a private matter between a company and its employees as to how the company's pension scheme should operate.</P>
      <P>Occupational pension schemes are voluntary arrangements and, as Minister, I have to ensure that a reasonable balance is maintained between protecting the rights of scheme members and interfering in the internal workings of a scheme which could impose additional costs on employers to the extent that they would be dissuaded from setting up new schemes or consider altering existing ones to the ultimate detriment of the members. Given the Government's stated goal of increased supplementary pension coverage and the commitment from employers in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to extend coverage, such an outcome would be most unwelcome from the Government's perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> One of my main concerns in the operation of integration is to ensure that people in receipt of an occupational and a social welfare pension receive the full value of increases in the social welfare pension and I have introduced legislation in the Social Welfare Acts to ensure that this is the case.</P>

      <P>The proactive targeting exercise identified Youghal as an area in need of assistance under my Department's programmes and the support agency in the southern region, funded under the community development programme, was asked to begin the process of establishing a community development project &ndash; CDP &ndash; in Youghal.

      <P>Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the Good Friday Agreement was assigned the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. The body was also charged with carrying out further studies on the Ulster Canal with a view to its possible restoration.</P>
      <P>The Ulster Canal project was raised at the recent North-South Ministerial Council Meeting which I hosted in Scarriff on 29 January 2001. The council was informed that a draft final report from consultants engaged in the matter had been received by Waterways Ireland which hopes to be in a position to present a preliminary assessment of the project to the two sponsoring Departments by the end of February 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>RTE's application for an increase in the television licence fee is being considered at present in my Department. As I have indicated before, I will bring any proposal for a change in the level of licence fee to Government as is the custom in these matters. If a decision to vary the level of the television licence fee is taken, it will be necessary for me to make statutory regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance under section 6(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926. Under section 6(4) of the same Act, I am obliged to lay any such regulation made before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as it is made. The section provides that if either House, within 21 sitting days from the date the regulation was laid before each House, passes a resolution annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly.</P>
      <P>The intention behind any increase that might be contemplated would be to maintain a high standard of public service broadcasting in this country. This is the impact that I would be hoping for if it is decided to increase the level of the fee.</P>

      <P>I have received a request from an NGO to allow access for NGOs to the draft national biodiversity action plan. Work on the drafting of the plan is now at an advanced stage and it is my intention to seek Government approval for its publication in the very near future. I should point out in that regard that the issues to be dealt with in the plan have been the subject of an extended formal public consultation process, to which many organisations and individuals responded. The Deputy may be assured that these submissions have informed the formulation of the plan. Furthermore, in response to the NGO request, officials of my Department met with key NGOs last month and explained in considerable detail the format and general approach of the draft plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most anxious to have the national biodiversity action plan published and adopted as policy at the earliest possible date. At this stage time is of the essence if we are to ensure that due regard will be given to protection of biodiversity in the <Col N="660" /> context of the extensive programme of works being undertaken under the national development plan and of the accelerated pace of development generally as a consequence of current unprecedented levels of economic growth. In addition, the NGOs will be invited to participate in the ongoing monitoring and review which is an integral part of the plan.</P>
    <P>On balance, therefore, given that there has already been a formal public consultation process, and that my officials have very recently met with NGOs to brief them on the draft plan, the public interest would best be served by having the plan published and its contents taken into account as soon as possible, rather than by engaging in another consultation process with its attendant delays.</P>

      <P>The report referred to was one of two conducted on the prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. The latest report from the research team, based on a very large sample of committal prisoners in 1999, found that infection with hepatitis C among the prisoners who took part in the survey was 22%. However, the prevalence of hepatitis C among declared drug users was found to be <Col N="661" /> 72%. These figures are similar to the prevalence of infection among drug users in the community. Almost one in four of all the 607 prisoners tested had evidence of hepatitis B or C or HIV infection. I have been acutely aware of the problem of hepatitis infection and the associated drug problem in our prisons for some time. Information on HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C is routinely available to all prisoners through prison medical and other staff. Prisoners diagnosed with any of these conditions are automatically referred to specialist clinics in external hospitals for assessment and advice in relation to current or envisaged treatment needs. Any recommended treatment is provided to prisoners while in prison.</P>
      <P>A steering committee on communicable diseases has been at work in my Department for some time dealing specifically with this important issue. In addition, the director of the prison medical service, in his annual report for 1998 recommended an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. I had no hesitation in accepting his recommendation and a multi-disciplinary group has been established to conduct this review. This group is expected to report in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I approved in 1999, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system. At my request the director general of the prisons service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from my Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior prisons service management and the probation and welfare service. The director general has agreed to chair the steering group himself to signal the importance that is attached by the prison authorities and Government to this issue. The group submitted its first report to myself in July of last year and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the prisons service and health boards. The first and most complex phase of these negotiations, achieving an agreed position between the prisons service and the health agencies about all the necessary staffing arrangements has just been completed. Dialogue between these agencies and the Department of Finance about sanctioning posts, etc., is due to commence in the coming days.</P>

      <P>Public service pension arrangements are set and approved by the Department of Finance which has confirmed that the pension payment award in this case is correct. For the information of the Deputy, I would like to add some supplementary information.</P>
      <P>Technical and professional civil servants may be entitled to an award of notional service &ndash; otherwise referred to as <i>ad hoc</i> or professional added years &ndash; for pension purposes if the minimum qualifications and-or experience required for appointment to the post are such that it would not have been possible for a person who met the minimum requirements, if appointed, to earn entitlement to a full pension by maximum retiring age. The number of professional added years awarded, up to a maximum of ten years where such an entitlement exists, depends on the minimum requirements for the job specified in the competition from which the particular officer was appointed. An award is not based on the qualifications and experience of an individual appointee.</P>
      <P>In this case the officer, who was 35 years of age when he was appointed to a position in the prisons service, does not have an entitlement to an award of professional added years because the regulations for the competition from which he was appointed specified that candidates had to be between the ages of 21 and 40. This condition meant that the youngest a candidate could have been was 21 and such a person, if appointed, would have been able to secure full pension by maximum retirement age. As a result, no award of added years can be made to any person appointed from that competition.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following traffic restrictions currently apply to the locations referred to by the Deputy: Clonliffe Avenue/Ballybough Road junction &ndash; a clearway is in operation from 16.00 hrs to 19.00 hrs. Double yellow lines extend from Ballybough Road along Clonliffe Avenue; O'Sullivan Avenue/Ballybough Road junction &ndash; a clearway is in operation from 16.00 hrs to 19.00 hrs. Double yellow lines extend from Ballybough Road to the mouth of this junction; and Kings Avenue/Ballybough Road junction &ndash; a clearway is in operation from 16.00 hrs to 19.00 hrs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> With regard to enforcement, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Ballybough Road is one of the north central arterial routes under Operation Artery. The route is patrolled regularly by members of the divisional traffic unit and any parking infringements are dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Garda authorities consider that, with the exception of King's Avenue/Ballybough Road, the locations referred to are adequately marked with double yellow lines. Perhaps the Deputy would raise the matter with Dublin Corporation in order to have similar restrictions placed at the entrance to King's Avenue. In the meantime, I understand that any vehicle found parked within five metres of the junction will be dealt with appropriately.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the possible future use of a particular site by the prisons authorities. The Government gave its approval in May 2000 for the provision of a further 700 closed prison places. Included in this is the provision of new facilities in the Dublin area for a male juvenile unit, a female juvenile unit and an adult prison. I should point out that I am obliged to provide the facilities for juveniles as a matter of urgency in order to comply with the provisions of the forthcoming Children Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular site referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that no decision has yet been made in respect of the location of any of these facilities. Any such proposals will be subject to planning and consultation procedures. It is not possible, at this juncture, to estimate completion times for any of these projects.</P>

      <P>There were 88 sex offenders released on completion of their sentences during 1999 and a further 117 released in 2000. Five of those released in 1999 and six released in 2000 had completed the specialised sex offender group treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> As I have explained to the House on previous occasions, there are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present &ndash; individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service, the multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork, Arbour Hill and the Curragh, the intensive offence focused group work programme &ndash; this has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh earlier this year &ndash; and the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation, many of those released would have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above. I am also advised that the prisoners who were released in the period in question included prisoners who decided not to participate in the sex offenders treatment programme and prisoners who, after professional assessment, were deemed not to be suitable to participate in it or where it was determined that it was beyond their ability to participate in it. I have asked the director general of the Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A steering group to put in place multi-disciplinary prisoner programmes has been established by the director general of the prisons service. This group, chaired by a senior prison governor, comprises representatives from my Department, senior prisons service management, the probation and welfare service, the psychology service, prisons education and the Prison Officers' Association. Its first task will be to oversee the establishment of a new intensive rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. This programme will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team consisting of prison officers, psychologists, probation and welfare staff and teachers. To this end the Prisons Service has recruited the services of a research psychologist to assist in the development of this programme. This work is expected to be completed in May this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that a major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of my Department and the department of psychology, University College Dublin.</P>

      <P>The first incident occurred on 25 January 2001 when an offender was being escorted by prison staff from Cloverhill Prison to Cork Prison. The offender was accompanied on the escort by three prison staff and he was handcuffed to one prison officer. He placed a syringe to the neck of one of the escorting officers, forc<Col N="669" /> ing the other officers to unlock his handcuffs. He escaped by running into a housing estate.</P>
      <P>The second incident occurred on 2 February 2001 when an offender was being escorted by prison staff from Waterford District Court to Cork Prison. Once again the offender was accompanied on the escort by three prison staff and he was handcuffed to one prison officer. The van transporting the offender was hijacked by a group of men who were in the possession of a firearm. The staff were forced to unlock the offender's handcuffs and the offender made his escape in a car accompanied by the hijackers. Thankfully, there were no injuries suffered by staff or members of the public in either incident. The Deputy will be aware that the Garda swiftly recaptured both escapees and I compliment it on its success in this respect.</P>
      <P>Incidents such as those mentioned above are rare. The vast majority of escorts effected by prison officers are completed without incident. The level of security on prison escorts varies from those involving the Army, Garda and prison officers, for maximum security or subversive prisoners, to those with a low security rating. Security considerations play a major role in the arrangements for all escorts. The security level in each case is determined following consultations with the Garda. Other factors taken into account include the length of sentence left to serve, whether the prisoner is regarded as a serious escape risk and the potential risk to the community. These prisoners were not, at any stage prior to their escape, regarded as serious enough to warrant a Garda presence on their escorts.</P>
      <P>Despite the most stringent precautions there will always be an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison. I am concerned at any escape from custody. Following these recent incidents I have conferred with the director general of prisons in the matter. At my request he has established a formal review of current practices in this area with a view to reducing to the absolute practical minimum the risk of such escapes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for allocation of personnel to individual areas, that the present strength of Blanchardstown Garda station is as follows: one chief superintendent, two superintendents, four inspectors, 17 sergeants and 77 gardaí. Of the above personnel, two sergeants and ten gardaí, one of whom is on temporary transfer to Ronanstown station, are assigned to the community policing unit. I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that the policing needs of the area are being <Col N="672" /> met. However, the situation will be kept under review and the question of assigning additional manpower will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of all Garda districts.</P>
      <P>In relation to crime in the area, I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures for 2000 show an increase of 3% on the previous year, that is, 37 crimes. However, due to initiatives taken by the Garda, crime for the first five weeks of 2001 is down by 124 crimes as compared to the same period last year. Efforts to maintain this decrease are continuing. In particular, additional patrols have been introduced to deal with anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <P>A psychiatric service is provided for prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists. Offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the prison medical officer, are in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment may be transferred by ministerial order to either the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, or a district mental hospital. In practice, all such transfers occur to the CMH.</P>
      <P>My officials in the Department and in the prisons service are working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve the organisation and level of psychiatric input in prisons in the Dublin area. It is envisaged that the improvements in psychiatric care being developed through this dialogue will be extended, where feasible, to prisons within other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established a group to review the structure and organisation of prisons health care services, including psychiatric services. The terms of reference of this group are: to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services for prisoners, taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramifications of possible new mental health legislation; to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly; to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system; to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations; to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection. The review body is under the chairmanship of Mr. John Olden, a senior member of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody. Mr Olden is a former <Col N="673" /> Secretary General of Roinn na Gaeltachta and has a prior record in prisons administration.</P>
    <P>The membership of the review group consists of representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Health and Children, Department of Finance, director of prison medical services, a senior prison governor, a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners, a nominee of the Royal College of Psychiatry, a nominee of An Bord Altranais, a nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society and a nominee of the Irish Dental Council. As the review is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the group's work at this time. I expect to have a report from the group by mid-2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible. Any recommendations made by this group in relation to improving prison health care services, including prison psychiatric services, will be treated as a matter of priority by me.</P>

      <P>My Department has provided a psychological service to post primary schools in County Kerry for many years now. A service to primary schools in the greater Tralee area was initiated in 1998, but unfortunately had to be discontinued due to the resignation of the psychologist concerned. It has proved difficult to find a replacement.</P>
      <P>However, as an interim measure, one of the newly appointed psychologists who is based in Cork has started to work part-time in Tralee and will deal with urgent cases from primary schools in the area. Posts are still being filled from the most recent competition for the recruitment of 50 extra psychologists to the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, and one of the new appointees will be assigned to County Kerry.</P>
      <P>Under the Government's plan to increase the service a further competition for recruitment to NEPS will be organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners later this year. It is intended that there will be up to seven NEPS psychologists working in County Kerry by the end of the year 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 280 and 281 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 people participate annually in the vocational training opportunities scheme at an annual cost to the State of £32 million, which is partially funded by the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The £15,000 referred to in the questions represents the amount of grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees in respect of each group on 20 students. It covers expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The rate of this grant has remained unchanged since 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is, 12 months, as an incen<Col N="677" /> tive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.27 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to expanding the national educational psychological service, NEPS, until it is available to all schools. It is envisaged that this will be achieved by the end of the year 2003. Until recently the NEPS service was available to all post-primary schools and approximately 725 primary schools. The Government's expansion programme is now beginning, with the assignment of 29 psychologists who have been recruited since September 2000.</P>
      <P>In those schools served by NEPS, the psychologists do not keep waiting lists in the sense of lists of named children who are seen in order. The psychologists work with principals and teachers to identify those children who are most in need of help and such children are seen within a short space of time. However, in those areas not yet served by NEPS, students currently only have access to the psychological services provided by the health boards and by voluntary bodies under their aegis. This may have led to waiting lists for those services in some areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making its decision to establish NEPS, the Government acknowledged that children need access to both clinical and educational psychological services. Once NEPS is universally in place, children will be referred to the agency appropriate to the kind of psychological support <Col N="678" /> that is needed. As soon as sufficient psychologists are in place, NEPS will be organised into ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions, in order to ensure effective collaboration. A joint NEPS-health board working group has begun to develop recommendations on common approaches to referrals.</P>
    <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy are not available in the form specified, although NEPS is piloting a detailed client database that should enable such information to be available in future years. The following table gives a summary of casework statistics before and after the establishment of NEPS in September 1999.</P>

      <P>There were and are significant differences in the regulatory and operational regime applying to industrial and reformatory schools on the one hand and to ordinary schools on the other which have implications for the responsibility of <Col N="680" /> the Minister of the day towards residents or pupils in the schools.</P>
      <P>The responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science in respect of reformatory and industrial schools is set down in the Children Act, 1908. Section 45 of the Act provides that the Minister may certify a school as fit for the reception of children following an inspection of the condition and regulation of the school and its overall fitness. That section also provides that every certified school is to be inspected at least once in every year. Section 47 of the Act provides that the Minister may withdraw the certificate of a school. Section 54 provides that rules relating to the management and discipline of a school are subject to the approval of the Minister. It is also the case that the detention of children in the schools was carried out in accordance with statutory requirements. Combined with these statutory provisions is the fact that the institutions concerned controlled all aspects of children's lives 24 hours a day, seven days a week with no reasonable capacity for access to or involvement by parents. There were no such statutory provisions regarding the regulation of ordinary day schools and the schools did not exercise the kind of total control over children's lives as the reformatory and industrial schools.</P>

The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £3,867 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. In relation to staffing, it was considered that the school in question has sufficient teaching staff already to implement the maximum class size guidelines of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes set under the new pro<Col N="682" /> gramme. This may necessitate the formation of classes from mixed standards.

      <P>Primary schools' running costs are met from my Department's scheme of capitation grants, supplemented by the local contribution. These funds are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance and other miscellaneous charges. Since this Government took office in 1997, the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45 per pupil to £75.50 in the current school year, and a rate of £80 will apply in the 2001-02 school year. This represents an increase of 77% over four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. <Col N="684" /> Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school. Circular 28/00, which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000, outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. The circular specifically states that &ldquo;schools may also wish to use the grant to alleviate the costs incurred with the provision of swimming classes or other similar activities&rdquo;. My Department will shortly be making arrangements for the issue of this year's grants to schools.</P>
    <P>It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes to provide grant assistance towards individual costs such as those associated with swimming. However, I am satisfied that the substantial increases in the capitation grant, combined with the annual physical education grant, constitute a meaningful response to the need for increased funding for schools.</P>

      <P>Schools in the voluntary secondary sector in County Waterford are funded on the same basis as other voluntary secondary schools nationwide.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion. In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. It is my intention that this report will continue to inform policy on school funding.</P>
      <P>While I intend to address the issues of equity and transparency of funding, I want to emphasise that my priority is the adequacy of funding levels for schools in the second level sector. I have already shown my commitment in this regard by the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
      <P>My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <P>The number of visits per annum to each school served by the National Educational Psychological Service depends upon identified needs. An important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. This includes students who under-achieve due to specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. In consultation with each school, the psychologist is able to estimate the numbers of students who may need psychological intervention and consequently the amount of time that needs to be spent in the school. It would be inadvisable to specify a limited number of visits per annum.</P>
      <P>All undergraduate courses in colleges of education have elements on the teaching of reading and on the identification of mild reading difficulties. More severe and specific reading difficulties &ndash; dyslexia &ndash; are dealt with by remedial teachers and they receive training in postgraduate courses in remedial education in a number of colleges of education. They receive training in the use of a range of diagnostic and other tests.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the identification, diagnosis and remediation of specific reading disability &ndash; dyslexia &ndash; is an interdisciplinary process involving teachers and psychologists.</P>
      <P>An expert group was set up in 1999 to examine pre-service teacher education programmes for primary teachers. This group is required to have regard to developments in relation to catering for children with special needs, including dyslexia. The report of the group is due to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>I also established a task force in October of last year to examine educational provision for children with dyslexia. I expect to have the report and recommendations of the task force shortly.</P>

      <P>Remedial teaching posts are allocated to each second level school to meet the needs of pupils who require learning support. Additional teaching hours are also allocated in respect of pupils with assessed special educational needs. Each such case is considered on its merits and additional teaching hours are allocated on the recommendation of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second-level schools towards the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment and software, for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide these pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. It is open to all second-level schools with such a pupil or pupils enrolled to make application under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently initiated a pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. Thirty-one schools around the country are participating in this pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia or other reading difficulties will be provided with a laptop computer for school and home use. A grant of £2,700 per student will be paid for the purchase of laptops and specially designed software for second year students identified as eligible for the project. Dedicated teacher training will also be provided and the National Centre for Technology in Education, the NCTE, will co-ordinate the project.</P>
      <P>I have established a special task force to review current approaches to the educational needs of children with dyslexia and to make recommendations on how support services for such children should be developed for the future. The task force, which is comprised of experts in the field of dyslexia, commenced its work in October 2000 and I expect to receive its report shortly. I am confident that the report of the task force will provide a valuable basis for the further development of education services for children with dyslexia.</P>

      <P>The school in question caters for pupils with a mild general learning disability and is entitled to a general staffing allocation based on a pupil teacher ratio of 11:1. I understand the school currently has an enrolment of 106 pupils and a staffing level of principal and 12 teaching assistants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school in question has for some years been allocated annual funding to employ a domestic science teacher for nine hours per week. It is a matter for the school's board of management to employ a suitably qualified teacher to deliver this service. My Department recently received correspondence from the school indicating that there are 12 pupils due to sit home economics in the junior certificate examination in June, 2001. Arising from this correspondence, my Department's inspectorate recently reviewed the school's allocation of home economics support. I understand that as a result of this review it was decided to increase the school's home economics teaching allocation from nine to ten hours per week. The school authorities, who were notified of this allocation in January of this year, should now proceed to employ a suitably qualified teacher to deliver the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295, 296 and 297 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Universities Act, 1997, decisions regarding the provision of particular courses is a matter for the university itself. I have no function in the matter, nor have I received any request for a meeting on the issue. My officials have raised this matter with the Higher Education Authority and the position is that the National University of Ireland, Galway, has made notable advances over recent years in expanding its long-standing provision of university programmes for adult learners in the northwest, especially in the Sligo area. For example, two cycles of a part-time, evening B.A. degree programme have been provided, as well as diploma courses in community development and in the psychology of counselling and a range of certificate programmes in other subjects. I also understand that the university was prepared to offer a third cycle of the evening B.A. programme in Sligo, commencing in September 2000 but that the number of applicants proved insufficient. These courses have been located in St. Angela's College Sligo, which likewise has endeavoured to be fully responsive to <Col N="693" /> community interests in the Sligo area. These courses could not have been provided by the university without the co-operation of the college in making available its facilities, augmented recently by a video-conferencing link supplied by the university. The most recent such diploma course offered in Sligo is the diploma in archaeology, a newly developed, two-year, part-time programme for adults, which has attracted adult students in both Sligo and Galway and has proved very successful. The university has confirmed that, in association with St. Angela's College, it will continue to monitor and investigate the demand which exists for the provision of degree programmes in a range of areas, including archaeology, and will endeavour to respond to demand in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour&rdquo; to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour. Under health and safety legislation, school management authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school including pupils. In a circular relating to guidelines on violence in schools, issued by my Department in 1999, schools were advised of their duties in this area and of the need to take positive measures to prevent and minimise the risk of violence within the school environment. In particular, the attention of schools was drawn to the need for effective school policies on school discipline and bullying. The circular advises schools that these policies should be reviewed on a regular basis and suggests that the early identification and resolution of weaknesses in school policies generally lessens the threat of violence in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on discipline commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made <Col N="694" /> available to all schools. While management authorities are not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in schools, my Department regularly receives telephone calls reporting alleged instances of bullying. These calls generally are informal enquiries and advice and assistance is offered by Departmental staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>Considerable funding for equipping PE halls or general purpose rooms in the case of primary schools, is provided as part of an overall project that involves building or substantially refurbishing such facilities. I also introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school. Circular 28/00 which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. It is open to schools to utilise this grant for the purchase of gym or physical education equipment should they wish to do so. My Department will soon make arrangements for the issue of this year's grants to schools.</P>
