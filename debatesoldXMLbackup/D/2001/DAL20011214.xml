      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 20 to 23.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to remove section 7 which provides that &ldquo;In the financial year 2002, an amount of 635 million shall be paid out of the Fund into the Exchequer&rdquo;. The Labour Party fundamentally disagrees with the approach of the Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in seizing this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy take the money from the pension fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>This money belongs to workers and employers. It has been paid in over many years for dedicated benefits, but it is being extirpated by the Government. It is clear that the social insurance fund and the pension fund are fundamentally different in nature. The 1% pension fund is taken from general revenue and used for purposes specified by legislation.</P>
      <P>The social insurance fund is also an hypothecated fund. It is a tax on wages and salaries and is designed to provide specific benefits through the social insurance system. It is a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system and, if the Minister had not acted in such an illegal manner, the surpluses which have accrued in the social insurance fund over recent years would have provided us next year with almost 2 billion for other purposes for which the Minister has not made provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn did so in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1977 and 1997 Fianna Fáil manifestos may echo each other. The 1997 manifesto entitled An Inclusive Society &ndash; mar dhea &ndash; gave a commitment to create a board to supervise the financing and operation of the social insurance fund. The most important phrase in this regard in the manifesto is that the fund is a workers' guarantee that their benefits will be there for them when needed. However, the Government has robbed the fund and taken away workers' money and benefits. It has done so in the most brazen manner to enable the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to save face. This is an outrage which sets a bad precedent. Deputy Michael Ahern rightly talks about people taking money from funds, but this Government is the first to do so. The Government has taken 635 million out of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1998, specify that the Minister is responsible for the current account. It would not be possible for the Minister <Col N="1383" /><Col N="1384" /> for Finance to take this money if the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had discharged his responsibilities to workers. He has not done so. The Department of Finance would not have been able to do what it is now doing if the Minister had done his job.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, and I may return to this issue under freedom of information, I asked the Minister to make public communications between the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which allowed this robbery of the social insurance fund to take place.</P>

      <P>The Minister could have provided for such a benefit this year. He could have begun by providing for a few days of paid parental leave which is our right under the European directive. However, he refused to do so, which is a black mark against his term of office over the past five years.</P>
      <P>The general secretary of ICTU, Mr. David Begg, rightly stated on television on the evening of the budget that the most annoying aspect of the social welfare provisions was the Minister's decision regarding the social insurance fund as he could have increased many benefits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern is chairman of the social affairs committee and I am its vice-chairman. The committee has discussed this issue many times. There was an opportunity to provide an adequate pension for older women who did not have enough stamps because, in the past, it was not possible to hold down a regular job and also perform homemaking duties. Under the partnership Government in 1994 there was an attempt to regularise this position. However, the situation has not improved for these women under this Minister. He had an opportunity to introduce a homemaker's benefit which would have brought those on non-contributory pensions up to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an opportunity to significantly expand and enhance social insurance benefits through the social insurance fund. However, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, spurned the opportunity to do so. Instead, during the best of times, they have taken away a third of the fund for purposes for which it was not <Col N="1386" /> intended. This is an outrage against the House, workers and employers and we should not allow it to pass. I propose that section 7 be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's policy is to increase taxes and reduce benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 is also in my name and this side of the House fully supports the deletion of section 7. It is ridiculous that, in the space of 40 or 50 minutes, we have to discuss one of the most radical departures from social welfare policy in a generation. It is nonsensical that the Parliament is expected to debate this matter in 30 minutes. We had a good debate about this on Committee Stage. However, there are many questions to which the Minister has failed to respond to which he must respond at some stage. I hope he gets a chance to do so today. At the heart of this issue is the right of workers, who have paid into a fund over a considerable period of time, to demand that benefits which have accrued to them will be honoured. The Government, in section 7, is proposing to withdraw that right for future generations of workers.</P>
      <P>The Minister was unclear on Second and Committee Stages in respect of the commitments he has given on the establishment of a board. There is a board for the national pension reserve fund, clearly established and with certain obligations. Why have we not obtained through legislation a board for the social insurance fund? The Minister said on Committee Stage that there is a working group under the PPF but that is not the commitment he made to the people. This was not a press statement but a solid guarantee given to the people in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which stated that a board would be established. Why has the Minister not brought forward amendments to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, or the consolidated Acts, to put that board in place? He has promised it, and if he is in favour of it why has he not proposed an amendment on Report Stage? His party wants a board established to &ldquo;ensure that there is proper supervision of the financing and the operation of the fund&rdquo;. The only way a board can be established is by changing the law. Why has he not done this? Why has he not tabled amendments to the second last Social Welfare Bill before the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason is that he wants to raid the money first and then put the board in place. That is the clear intention. Deputy Broughan is correct about this. The Government is taking £500 million out of the fund in a flash prior to establishing a board. It will promise to honour its manifesto commitment because &ndash; I highlighted this earlier this week &ndash; it was shown to have mislead the public in 1997 on that commitment. It will table amendments to the next Social Welfare Bill to establish the board. The union and employer trustees will be there but the fund will at that stage be short <Col N="1387" /> £500 million. That is a preposterous situation and I am fundamentally opposed to the manner in which the Government is making amendments and changing the fundamental proposal of 1952. As I said on Committee Stage, this is not the Minister's money, it belong to the workers. It comes from PRSI contributions of employers and employees. It is an insurance fund, not a general current account from which one can take money one day and replace it the next. It is a liabilities account for which there is a specific purpose.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the legislation does the Minister tell us where the money will be spent. If he told me the various benefits that will accrue to workers as a result of this raid we might look at the proposal differently, but it is a two line section proposing to take £500 million overnight. When the board is in place next year it will have no say in this. Why does the national pension reserve fund have a different form of supervision from the social insurance fund? The national pension reserve fund was established by this Government, and I commend it, but why should the social insurance fund be administered differently? I suspect the reason is that the Government knew they were stuck for cash this year and would raid the contributions of workers in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a sleight of hand. I have repeatedly said that what the Minister is doing is bad. He is setting a bad precedent. While workers will not be exercised by this over the Christmas holidays or the next few months, it will be looked back on as his worst episode. He has done many good things in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but this is the worst. Future generations will look on this raid as the worst example of financial management by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance. This is not the Minister's money. At no stage has he told us what he is using it for. It will be lost in a black hole. It is being used as an Elastoplast to patch up the financing of Ireland plc for the next six or seven months. The economy, currently in serious crisis, will then be handed to a new administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues were given the best set of figures of an incoming Government since the foundation of the State. The rainbow Government managed the economy to such a degree that there were historic surpluses at the disposal of the Government for the last four and a half years. The Minister for Finance said the economy could grow by up to 3.9% but the Department of Finance has said there is a risk attaching to that figure. What happens if that level of growth is not achieved next year? The black hole will grow even further. As the Minister and his colleagues came into Government they were given an astonishing set of figures by the rainbow Government. They even criticised that <Col N="1388" /> Government for over expenditure of £600 million and yet this Government is projecting a deficit of nearly 3 billion at the end of next year. Where is the commitment to financial prudence?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that workers or those who commit money through employers' PRSI will believe any more commitments. This raid is wrong. It is against the spirit of the legislation introduced by a notable predecessor, Dr. Ryan, in 1952. It is also against the spirit of our social security system and would not happen in any other system in Europe. The Minister has still not ensured that the commitment given in 1997 will be put in place in the dying days of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is preposterous that we have just 30 minutes to discuss this because there are colleagues on all sides who want to contribute but we must not let this day pass without highlighting the illegality of the Government's move. This Social Welfare Bill is a fraud because of the actions of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, has not given confidence to the House in any of his comments on Second or Report Stages. Fine Gael supports amendment No. 35 and we demand that the legislation be changed, even at this late stage, so that the workers' money is protected for future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment, however I agree with Deputy Hayes that this Government was given the most astonishing opportunity to move forward and do some good things in social welfare. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has done just that. The previous regime gave particularly miserable benefits. We all remember the increases of £1.80 and £2.20 per week. Against that background there is no doubt that, even if the Minister was Scrooge himself, he would look good because what went before him was so dreadful. Much good has been done in terms of social welfare and the budget is so good that this is the only issue the Opposition has to fight on. It is a contrived issue and the only thing they have been able to jump on in trying to generate an argument.</P>

      <P>I empathise with some of the comments about workers, but they do not want handouts. They are decent people and if a board is to be set up then so be it. Maybe the Minister will clarify the point in his response, but my understanding is that over the years the Exchequer has frequently bailed out the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the reverse. The fund is paying back some of the subsidy it received. The workers are not looking for something for nothing. This is a fund they pay into to improve their benefits from time to time and that is fair enough. However, the Exchequer had to assist that fund over the years to the tune of some £10 billion, and now that it is in surplus approximately one twentieth of what was given to bail out the fund is being paid back. I do not know if the long-term intention is to pay back all subsidies given to the fund over time, but there would be a certain logic if that were to happen. Then the workers would have a right to spend and allocate what was left in the fund for their benefit.</P>
      <P>I worry about the trend in social welfare because for years people paid into a fund what they regarded as pay related social insurance. That principle is being watered down and even if I look at pressure from the Opposition in recent times, it is all about benchmarking and the person on the lowest rate of supplementary benefit. We have totally taken our eye off the ball in regard to the person who is paying into the fund. On Committee Stage some Opposition Members again fought the battle on behalf of the non-contributory recipient in each category. If it was the case that workers and those paying into the fund were being raided and were not getting their slice of the action, I would have some sympathy with what Opposition Members are saying, but that is not what we are doing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan and others in all parties and all sides have fallen into this trap. We have been taken over by lobby groups fighting the battle for the non-contributory recipient when we should be fighting for the person who has been paying into the fund and who is entitled to get their payments back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that I have made contradictory statements in the past, but all the arguments from the Opposition parties, and probably from our own benches, have been on behalf of the other people. We have watered down the meaning of this fund over the years. If we realise now that this is the workers' fund and are going to commit ourselves to a change of policy, then so be it. That would be great but that is not the position. The statements and policies of recent times have made it easy &ndash; even taking the Opposition line <Col N="1390" />&ndash; for Government to take funds, if that is what it is doing. However, now that the fund is in surplus it is paying back a small portion of the loan it got over the years.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments made by the Opposition are crazy. I presume there is a trade-off in negotiations in every budget. The bottom line from a social welfare point of view is the size of the package and the Minister has done very well to secure a package of £850 million, which is extraordinary. The Opposition comments about homemakers are off the wall. Let us be fair, Opposition members can slag the Minister if they wish, but they should pick real issues.</P>

Over many years the payments to spouses were decreasing, but the Minister totally reversed that trend last year, particularly for couples over 66 where the applicant got £10 and the spouse got £15. That has never been done before and was a huge step forward in reversing the trend and working towards what will ultimately be a homemaker's payment.</P>

        <b>: </b>If a holiday fund for workers was raided by the management and spent on painting premises and buying diesel for engines there would be uproar. It is unbelievable that the management of this fund, in the person of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, can look on idly while it is being raided when he should be arguing that it be spent on the people for whom he is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He increased widows pensions for those aged <Col N="1392" /> over 66 by £12 while those below that age should have been looked after as well. The Minister had so many areas to which he could allocate money and it is appalling that a colleague was allowed raid this fund while the Minister said he has given out so much that the people do not need any more. I do not know how this can be justified. It is totally indefensible that the money was not used for the purposes for which it was intended. People who are struggling have to look at this Minister giving away £500 million to a Minister to spend on general expenses. How can this be regarded as proper administration of a fund under the care of the Minister?</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleagues have said the fund has not been raided and people have spoken about the bad old days of Brian Ború, shouting about what was given in the past&mdash;</P>

In other words, the party will end up not putting any money into the fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan said he would raise corporation tax but he knows that is not Labour Party policy. He knows that if the Labour Party is in Government after the next general election corporation tax will not be increased because when it was last in Government it fought to have it reduced. We implemented those reductions when we took office. The Labour Party should not be hypocritical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government is harnessing the potential of public private partnerships to help deliver the conditions needed to sustain output and employment in the economy over the medium term. The economy's performance during the 1990s was remarkable. Growth, as measured in terms of GNP, has averaged over 8% per annum since 1994, employment rose by more than 50% during the same period and the rate of unemployment fell from 15% to 4%. The size of the economy has almost doubled in a relatively short period. This growth has been led by significant gains in competitiveness and extremely high levels of business profitability. Rewarding enterprise and risk-taking is a key element of Ireland's success. While the rate of growth has slowed down, the economy is set for continued strong growth well into the medium term.</P>
      <P>It is projected that growth of approximately 5% per annum can be sustained during the next decade. This is above the 3% projected for the EU economy as a whole. As a rapidly growing entity within the euro zone, the Irish economy represents a broad range of positive investment opportunities. Public private partnerships will play a significant role in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past two years administrative and management structures have been created to assist the development of an effective, efficient and broad infrastructure programme offering new opportunities for the development of public private partnerships in Ireland. This development rests on firm foundations. There has been a long and fruitful tradition of close co-operation between the public sector and private business in Ireland. Throughout the past decade of strong economic performance, high level co-ordinated economic and social policy priorities have been <Col N="1399" /> based on partnership agreements between the Government, employers and industry representatives, trade unions, farmers organisations and, more recently, the voluntary sector. These agreements have been the foundation for fiscal consolidation, the maintenance of sustainable growth in investment, rising real disposable incomes, employment growth, the reversal of emigration trends and a reduction in unemployment to an historically low rate.</P>
    <P>The most recent agreement is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In common with earlier agreements, the PPF contains clear commitments to a shared income and to fiscal and social policy objectives. The programme also reaffirms the commitment of the social partners to the PPP process. In particular, it provides for the formulation of an appropriate framework for the management and further development of the public private partnership process. Confidence in the future development of public private partnerships in Ireland is rooted in practical examples of fruitful co-operation between public authorities and private business. In the past decade, two toll roads across the River Liffey in Dublin, which were privately designed, built and financed are now operated by the private sector. The provision of decentralised Government offices and, recently, a public private partnership approach to prison building are other examples of successful projects involving elements of the PPP approach. The Government is now bringing a more structured approach to private sector involvement in the procurement of economic infrastructure priorities.</P>
    <P>Why public private partnerships? The case for adopting a more structured approach to PPPs is clearcut. Submissions from IBEC and the CIF in the late 1990s set out a clear and compelling business case for the development of the PPP concept. These submissions were followed by a consultancy on public private partnership commissioned by the Government, and the consultants' report recommended the creation of formal structures to manage public private partnerships and the designation of a series of private projects across the various sectors. The consultants concluded that there were no substantial statutory or administrative impediments to the development of PPPs.</P>
    <P>The economic case for public private partnerships has been strengthened by the prolonged period of exceptional growth in output in Ireland, which has continued from the mid-1990s to earlier this year. The doubling in size of economic activity in Ireland since 1993 is putting pressure on physical infrastructure, especially in public transport and on the roads. Higher standards set by EU directives and international conventions are demanding increased investment in the environmental area. Preserving our green environment requires better quality water supply, improved waste water treatment facilities, new investment in waste management infrastructure <Col N="1400" /> and an innovative approach to waste recovery and recycling. These needs are recognised in the current national development plan, and the role of PPP within the NDP is to provide an added impetus to the infrastructure programmes and adopt a systematic and structured approach to the involvement of the private sector.</P>
    <P>The precise designation of public private projects will be decided as the national development plan projects are implemented. It is clear that the key criteria for selection are long-term value for money and the priority of the project at national level. Acceleration of the overall national development investment programme and early delivery of individual projects are the key objectives for the PPPs. These objectives can be obtained through the effective management of the process and the advantages of the public private partnership approach include optimal risk transfer, that is, the allocation of risks to a party best able to manage them and at least cost rather than simply loading risk onto the private partner. It also has an advantage with regard to the life cycle costing which recognises long-term cost factors in addition to the initial capital expenditure, direct payments and user charges which incentivise value for money and relate project costs to utilisation of the assets.</P>
    <P>In the area of competition, there is another advantage because it generates more efficient and effective resource allocation and productivity. Also, private sector innovation and technological, financial and management expertise can be captured by a PPP approach to projects traditionally within the sphere of public authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government, following acceptance of the recommendation contained in the consultancy study to which I previously referred, established a central PPP unit in the Department of Finance to lead, drive and co-ordinate the process. In order to ensure that the implementation of the projects is overseen at the highest level, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructural development and public private partnership. It is chaired by the Taoiseach and its membership includes the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and other senior Ministers serviced by a cross-departmental team.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the public private partnerships has been significantly different to the beginnings of the private finance initiative of the UK. The drivers in Ireland are accelerated delivery of national priority infrastructure projects, together with the attainment of value for money over the full life cycle of the asset rather than the procurement of public service assets off balance sheet. The process involves structured consultation with the key stakeholders. The Government has adopted a pilot project approach to developing the market for the PPPs. In the UK the initial projects involved NHS Trust, prisons and defence facilities while, in Ireland, the main emphasis is on toll roads, educational projects, public trans<Col N="1401" /> port and in the water supply, water treatment and waste management sectors. The initial PPP projects announced in 1999 included three roads and the operation of the light rail system in Dublin and projects in the environmental and educational sectors. The estimated total capital expenditure of the pilot projects is 760 million. It was intended that those projects would blaze a trail for subsequent projects. It is not a matter of waiting for these projects to be completed but to learn from them as they proceed.</P>
    <P>The aim of the central PPP unit is to ensure the speedy development of the pilot projects to a marketable stage. At mid-2001 all of the pilot projects were on schedule with no significant delays anticipated. In the roads area there were two projects at qualification stage, the Waterford by-pass and a section of the N4 in Galway. A third project, the river crossing in Limerick, is due to reach the market again this year. A further eight PPP roads projects, to follow the three pilot projects previously launched, were announced at mid-year by the National Roads Authority. Altogether the estimated investment of the 11 roads projects is 1.3 billion, with a potential private finance input of 889 million. It shows the importance of public private partnerships. The cost of 1.3 billion to the Exchequer would be quite difficult to sustain, but the public private income coming on stream makes those projects feasible.</P>
    <P>With the launch of the private projects by the Minister for Education and Science, public private partnerships in Ireland moved from a concept to reality. Guidelines on modern contracts and sectoral and overall levels are being developed. It is now up to the private sector to demonstrate its innovation skills to match this commitment to deliver the infrastructure priorities and to show that the public private partnership approach will provide value for money for the Exchequer and for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very impressed by the Government's general approach to this, if only because this Bill was published on 12 June and we are concluding Second Stage on 14 December. It does not seem that this Bill is very high up on the Government's priority list. Perhaps that is a cavil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as enthusiastic about some aspects of public private projects as the Government seems to be. Although this may be the natural ebb and flow of politics, I seem to remember that the principal Government party was not very keen about this when in Opposition, but it seems to have got religion about it now. It is always useful to remind people about the actuality of the PPP projects we have seen so far. The East Link and West Link bridges, for example, are regularly offered as examples of public private co-operation, which they are. However, to the best of my knowledge, about one quarter of the capital required for the East Link bridge was provided by the private sector. It might have been a similar proportion for <Col N="1402" /> the West Link bridge. In return for providing that amount of the initial capital, the private sector got the franchise to collect the tolls for 30 years. That is a sobering thought. We should always remind ourselves that the private sector is not in business for the good of its or the Exchequer's health. It is in business to make money and it will participate in projects of this kind when the conditions are right for it to make money.</P>
    <P>By and large, particularly when the State is in reasonable fiscal health, which we still are despite the best efforts of the Government to squander it, public authorities and particularly the Exchequer will always be able to borrow more cheaply than the private sector. It was interesting to hear Deputy Michael Ahern give what I presume is the official Government line on this issue. When one strips away the fancy language attached to public private projects, what is involved is a balance of considerations of speed against considerations of cost. If it is done correctly, the projects are selected on the basis of the benefit they will be to not just national income but also to national welfare generally. We operate a comparison between the speed discount rate and the cost discount rate and often we will conclude that it is worthwhile to pay a little more to have a project done more quickly than to wait for the point at which it can be inserted into the overall national funding programme if it were to be 100% financed by State authorities.</P>
    <P>However, that means there are limits to the areas where it is worthwhile to consider this. Some of the proportions are rather interesting. Deputy Michael Ahern, who sounded as if he were speaking from a Department of Finance script, mentioned eight road projects which are being contemplated, in addition to the three that have been identified. If I heard his figures correctly, he said the total cost of the eight projects would be 1.8 billion. They are now included in the NDP because the private sector will produce approximately 0.8 billion and the cost breakdown is 1 billion from the public sector and 0.8 billion from the private sector. The Government has obviously concluded that there is a gain in welfare from paying a little more for that 0.8 billion to get those projects included in a period of the plan when it is open to the Exchequer to spend 1 billion, rather than waiting for the period when the Exchequer can afford to spend 1.8 billion. That may well be a legitimate conclusion but it is not self evident.</P>
    <P>Some experiences should give us pause. In the UK, the procedure was more akin to off balance sheet financing than the type of thing the Government here has in mind, which is a positive point in favour of what this Government is doing. The UK started with prisons and defence facilities. I believe the UK authorities are discovering, certainly as far as the provision of defence facilities is concerned, that they might have made the wrong choice. For example, they contracted out virtually all training for their air force to the <Col N="1403" /> private sector. They have also contracted out all the search and rescue facilities to the private sector and a great deal of the training for their ground forces. They now find that when they get involved in situations such as the Gulf War and Afghanistan, the private sector cannot react as quickly to the needs of a war situation as the public sector can. There are, therefore, some areas where there are serious doubts.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we will experience the same problem because I hope we will not get involved in situations where that type of comparison arises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I have to belie myself immediately by saying the contracting out to the private sector of helicopter search and rescue services in this country has provided us with a better service more quickly than if it had been provided only by the Defence Forces. I am critical of what has been done because we should have used the window of opportunity that was given to us, by the availability of a private sector service, to develop the capacity of the Air Corps to do that. That has been a mistake and I hope it will soon be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Different types of arrangements are being contemplated under the Bill and they are set out in section 3(1). There is a quirk in the wording of the section which is rather interesting and which the Minister might explain. Section 3(1)(a)(i) speaks of the design, construction and operation of an asset &ldquo;and the provision of finance, if required&rdquo;, subsection (1)(a)(ii) refers to the construction of an asset with the provision of services relating to it &ldquo;and the provision of finance, if required&rdquo; while subsection (1)(a)(iii) refers to design and construction together with the provision of finance without the phrase &ldquo;if required&rdquo;. Subsection (1)(a)(iv) refers to the provision of services, which never requires finance. Why is the qualification &ldquo;if required&rdquo; included in the first two subparagraphs and not in the third?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to give the certainty of a legal basis for projects that exist and for local authorities because there is no legislation in place for many of these things. We want to provide certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good explanation. Section 4 deals with the various functions of the partners and of the State authority. Section 4(3) states: &ldquo;The conferral of a function of a Minister of the Government on a partner by a public private partnership arrangement shall not affect the Minister's responsibility to Dáil Éireann or as a member of the Government for the performance of the function&rdquo;. That is a wise provision. It <Col N="1404" /> means the House can question the relevant Minister on the performance of those functions.</P>
      <P>The current arrangement with the National Roads Authority is unsatisfactory. It is not the only area where these arrangements are unsatisfactory. In this politically correct handing over of political functions to appointed bodies, important areas of operation, for which Ministers are operationally responsible in the sense that they allocate the money, are areas about which Members of the House cannot question them. It is not possible for a Member of the House to hold the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to account for anything the National Roads Authority does because of how the NRA was set up. It is not possible to ask the Minister to explain decisions of the National Roads Authority. That is bad. That fault is not in this Bill but it is in the legislative base we have given to the NRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil committees have had the NRA before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil committee can ask the NRA polite questions but the NRA does not have to account for itself to the committee. That is a little off-putting. In some of the cases where public private partnerships are proposed for roads, and where tolls are proposed, reading between the lines of what the NRA say, I find that the NRA feel the idea of tolling has been imposed upon it by the Government. The NRA is being obliged to produce tolling schemes about which it is not convinced.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised at that because the NRA is given a very technical function, which is to design and build roads. It is not particularly interested in having political frills put on to that function. In this country's situation, tolling is more of a nuisance than an advantage. Stretches of Irish road are not long enough to make tolling worthwhile, and the time savings possible are not long enough to be able to externalise the costs and to make motorists pay. We will have a series of little tolls that will be more of a nuisance than an advantage, and which will vitiate many of the advantages of building motorways in the way we propose.</P>
      <P>I have seen little imagination applied in dealing with the problems the tolls will present, for example, for the people of Kilcock, which is not in my constituency, Enfield, which almost is in my constituency, and Kinnegad. Other difficulties of that kind will come up. We do not have long enough distances of motorway without junctions to make tolls work in the same way that they do on the Italian <i>autostrada</i> and French <i>autoroutes</i>. I have travelled many miles and kilometres on those roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the Schedule of the Bill. It mentions the agencies and State authorities empowered by this Bill to enter into public <Col N="1405" /> private partnerships. They include local authorities, the Commissioners of Public Works, the NRA, a health board established under the Health Act, 1970, and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. What kind of services does the Minister see the health boards and the ERHA involving themselves in? Will we see public private projects applied to health? What kind of projects will they be? The case for public private partnership is less obvious in that area than in areas such as roads, if only because roads do not change as quickly as hospitals and health facilities. It has been a feature of medicine across Europe that almost by the time a hospital is built &ndash; from concept to design to construction &ndash; there are changes in technology that need to be provided for. Those projects need a more hands on approach from the public authorities than is got from public private partnerships.</P>
    <P>By contrast, an area where the Government has been too timorous in dealing with this is that of waste management. That is because, until recently, in spite of the evidence suggesting we should take a different view, the Government has left too much of the decision-making process to local authorities. We do not have waste separation facilities and waste recycling facilities on the scale that we should. We do not have thermal treatment facilities or incineration, or whatever euphemism is now used to describe that process, and this is because the Government has left this to the local authorities. Local authorities have, by and large, given in to the kind of nonsensical pressure against the provision of all these facilities.</P>
    <P>People always say they are not against recycling or waste separation but that they do not want a unit in their town. They say they are against incineration before meeting politicians &ndash; I have had this experience recently &ndash; to tell them they have come across a great scheme which separates out waste, sorts it, takes out the heavy metals and organic material, puts the rest of the material together, and produces an inert block that can be used to power electricity generating stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. Combined heat and power. When I tell such people that this scheme is incineration by another name they are astonished. They hold a politically correct view that incineration means that everything that is produced, including heavy metals, is put into a big furnace leading to dioxins spewing out all over the countryside. That the Government has left this entire matter to local authorities has meant that it has been vulnerable to that kind of mistaken analysis The result is that, instead of having a rational waste management policy, we have a situation where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must visit the unlicensed toxic dumps that are continually being discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Public private partnerships in the area of waste management could work. We have them in a half-hearted way in the operation of landfills. There are a number of privately operated landfills around the country that seem to get on reasonably well with public authorities, although who knows what happens between the point of origin of the waste and the time it arrives at a landfill. Public private partnerships could work well in the area of waste management and that could give us a better mix of waste management policies than we have at present. It requires the Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to do what the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear it. I wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government would get on with it. This issue has been sticking out a mile for a long time. We need a firm hand taken.</P>
      <P>Another area where public private partnerships are held out as the way of the future is in the provision of light rail transport in Dublin. I am afraid this will get PPPs a bad name because, so far, the Government has been unable to decide on the structure on which to run the partnership. The Luas line could be up and running if the Government had not allowed the best, in terms of PPPs, to get in the way of the good in terms of the structure that was there in 2000.</P>
      <P>I have one final gripe to make about the Bill. Section 7 provides for the Minister for Finance, following consultation with an appropriate Minister, to make orders amending the Schedule, that is, amending the kind of public bodies that may involve themselves in these PPPs. That order &ndash; surprise, surprise &ndash; takes the passive form by saying that the order shall not be made if a resolution disapproving of the draft was passed by either House within the next subsequent 21 days.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of order that Governments bring in which they know they will never have to defend, because the House can deal with an order like that only if the Government orders it for debate. That is anti-democratic and anti-participation, and I am disappointed once more to find that, in an area like this, where we are not dealing with the detail of the operation of the Bill but dealing in a real sense with where the action happens, the Government has chosen to come forward with this form of passive order. I invite the Minister to return on Committee Stage to make a more rational provision for an order which requires that the orders be debated in the House, and that they get an affirmative vote before they come into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Bradford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. We all recognise there has been an economic downturn not only in Ireland but internationally. The sequence of events in <Col N="1407" /> regard to the 11 September incident will create difficulties for us in developing the economic infrastructure required by this country under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The national development plan for infrastructure will not be sustainable unless there is an increase in the public private partnerships. We have taken steps in that direction recently. I saw an announcement recently in regard to five schools in different locations around the country. The State is entering into a contract with an English private company for 25 years after which they will revert back to the State. The State will make a payment on a yearly basis. I hope we will see more of that happening. I am concerned about the capital building programme for schools, which I assume will be announced in the near future, and the focus on the unsatisfactory condition of many primary schools in particular. Unless we see something imaginative, the existing facilities will remain and children will continue to be educated in a most unsatisfactory educational environment.</P>
    <P>I have seen improvements over the past few years, as we all have, in the standard of our national primary routes in particular. Under the national development plan, it is hoped to develop this even faster. Limerick County Council has a very effective road design office which caters for the mid-west region. The mid-west region has seen quite a lot of development of high quality roads recently. However, those travelling to Kerry and passing through the main highway from Limerick to Newcastle West and on to Killarney would like to see even more improvements. A by-pass for Adare, Newcastlewest and Abbeyfeale has been in the pipeline for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Because of an economic downturn and a shortage of finance, none of us would like to see that type of development being held up and the advances we have made over the past few years being stifled. The public private partnership is a very good concept and this legislation, which underpins it, is of vital importance because we will not achieve what we want to achieve unless we have something imaginative such as this.</P>
    <P>There has to be something in a public private partnership for private industry. The incentive in the case of roads and tunnels is the probability that a fee will be paid. Many of us have experience of travelling on the one toll section of the motorway in Dublin and people have accepted that they must pay a fee. It was developed exclusively by a private company. I noted recently that there will be a public private partnership development in that area which is extremely important because all of us see the gridlock that has developed along that main arterial route to the airport. Any development to alleviate that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We will probably have a debate on this issue in Limerick, although probably not for a few years. Earmarked for Limerick is the Shannon port tun<Col N="1408" /> nel. Anyone crossing from Limerick to Clare will see the congestion on the three existing bridges. We develop radial roads yet we face a bottleneck when entering and crossing the city. The Shannon port tunnel will ease that congestion and will take about 30,000 motorists off those bridges and into the new tunnel. It will be a very important part of the development of that area, especially with Shannon which is very important to the economic hinterland that surrounds the Shannon area. We look forward to that development which could end up as a public private partnership. We await the debate which will inevitably ensue as to whether there should be tolling or shadow tolling. It is estimated that this project will cost at least £75 million. Because it is a tunnel, it will cost about 7% more than a bridge. It is, however, considered essential given the vitality of Limerick Port with up to 200 ships per year. It is not feasible to build a bridge and a tunnel is the most logical option, although it will be a lot more expensive.</P>
    <P>We have seen many exciting developments. One area, however, which continues to be ignored is the N69 route. It is a pet project of mine because it stretches from Limerick to Foynes. The industrial hub of our area happens to be along the Shannon Estuary which is often described as the jewel of the western world. There is potential for further development at that location. The main barrier to those developments is the condition of the N69. It is regarded as a national secondary route. I hope the National Roads Authority, which received a comprehensive submission from Limerick County Council on what is required, will carry out the type of development warranted. Heavy trucks using a road, whether a secondary or a national primary route, demand proper road conditions to which they are entitled. The problems these heavy trucks create for our existing road structure make it inevitable that we will have to consider improvements in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill which states that one can enter into joint partnerships with local authorities. Possibly that concept has not been developed enough up to now. Those of us who live in rural areas are aware of the difficulties faced by small communities by a lack of sewerage facilities. When it comes to the capital programme, only a trickle of those projects are granted permission each year because of the cost. Unless there are new imaginative proposals to provide the type of sewerage structure required, many of these rural communities will die. In recent years, we have seen tremendous improvements which have made many of these communities more vibrant. We have seen modern roads, stone walls and nice landscaping works but quite often the heart of these communities has gone.</P>
    <P>Unless the local authorities, the Government and all concerned look at this issue differently, many of these rural communities will not survive. It is possible that a public private partnership could be a company or a group of individuals in <Col N="1409" /> a community who will pay a lot more for the provision of a service but what is important is that it improves the situation. In many cases, people would lend themselves to giving a contribution because it costs about £3,500 to put in one of these bio-cycle systems. If people got together with the local authority, it might be feasible to do something.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague Deputy Finucane. He can now avail of the pairing I had offered him. He can go about his business.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to comment briefly on a few issues that are relevant to my constituency and others. I readily support the overall thrust of the Bill, namely to try to put in place a firm structure for public private partnership agreements. I am glad we have moved away from the politics of pure ideology. Any system we can implement or schemes we can put in place that will help secure economic progress and social advancement should be supported by the House. With that in mind, there is great scope for public private partnership agreements. The public and private sectors, working together, can ensure a better future for the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, we have to be careful in respect of giving a <i>carte blanche</i>. One aspect that worries me, because it impacts upon my constituency, relates to the present road building programme, in particular the tolling schemes that are being proposed. I am sure Deputies Dukes and Finucane mentioned them as well. Arising from a number of debates we have had in this House and a number of questions which the Taoiseach has answered, we still appear to be absolutely unclear about the position on tolling schemes.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, there is a proposed tolling scheme for the bypass of the town of Fermoy. It is quite extraordinary that there is a proposal to put a toll on a town bypass. It goes against all shades of opinion on bypasses, including engineering opinion. When we tried to make representations on the matter, we met the National Roads Authority. We were given a nice cup of tea but told we were in the wrong place and that we should have been speaking to the Government or the Minister. When we raised the matter in the House we were told it could not be raised here because it is a matter for the National Roads Authority. We have been unable to ascertain who took the decision to put in place a tolling scheme for the Fermoy bypass. I am sure that query relates to many bypasses and projects throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of who is responsible, I question the economics and value for money afforded to the taxpayer in respect of such schemes. From the figures being made available by the National Roads Authority, it appears the tolling of some of these bypasses, in particular, is giving a blank cheque <Col N="1410" /> to developers. I am aware that certain people in the Department of Finance are concerned about this and have indicated that many of these projects could be done perhaps as quickly and efficiently by the Department by borrowing and making money available to the local authorities. We should examine this before handing a blank cheque to developers. That is one side of the argument.</P>
    <P>The other aspect, which is more a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority, concerns putting a tolling plaza on a town bypass. I have no difficulty with the tolling of a major motorway route, but in my constituency in the town of Fermoy we have been looking for a bypass for 15 years. Now that it is to be provided, we have come up with the not very bright idea of putting a tolling plaza on it. One does not need to be an Einstein to recognise that much of the traffic we have spent years trying to divert out of the town will now come back into the town to avoid the tolling plaza. It makes very little economic or social sense.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authority involvement in public private partnerships, I heard Deputy Dukes speak of waste management. I readily agree with him. That we do not have a national waste management authority means we have 26 different plans rather that one national plan. I continue to be amazed at our failure to do anything meaningful in terms of recycling or waste reduction. The last two or three budgets provided no incentive to promote recycling or waste reduction.</P>
    <P>Recycling is a loss-making operation. Recycling operators cannot make a profit. If we attempted to put in place certain financial incentives &ndash; a tax package &ndash; to make recycling viable, private funding could be introduced to assist local authorities. Those of us involved with local authorities have to recognise that every local authority is now facing a waste management crisis. The debate focuses on landfills in some counties, incinerators in others and different forms of technologies in other local authorities.</P>
    <P>Nothing is being done to reduce the amount of waste being created. Very little is being done to build material recovery facilities. There is a role for the Government in putting in place tax incentives to make these urgently required facilities feasible. Such incentives would make it possible to have private money invested. I hope we make progress in this respect. It is required urgently.</P>
    <P>Affordable housing, which is a good concept, is not taking off to any meaningful degree. In my local authority of north Cork, we currently have 25 or 35 houses being made available under the affordable housing scheme. We should be able to sit down with people in the construction industry and devise a reasonable public private partnership that would give a reasonable return to the investor and bring affordable housing on stream. This sounds like a good concept but, at present, the affordable housing stock exists only in legis<Col N="1411" /> lation. It does not exist in practice in most local authorities. At a time when the housing problem is very grave and when there is a downturn in the building industry, we should work hard to put an attractive system in place. There is scope, by way of public private partnership, to make affordable housing work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept in the legislation. We should not rush into public private partnerships without reflecting on the various schemes being proposed. I welcome involvement in terms of housing, waste management and road development. I find it extraordinary that road projects take so long in this country. I am very concerned about the proposal to toll town bypasses. If we have to have a substantial return to the investor, we should consider shadow tolling, which works quite effectively in Britain and many European centres. I do not like to see bypasses that were built to take traffic away from town centres being tolled, resulting in traffic coming back through the town centres. I hope the Minister will reflect on that and advise us on the responsibility of the National Roads Authority or the Department of the Environment and Local Government in making those calls.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just five minutes remaining before I call on the Minister. I call on Deputy Roche but I understand the Minister is prepared to allow Deputy Durkan five minutes in view of the season that is in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take less than five minutes to facilitate Deputy Durkan and the Minister. I welcome the idea of public private partnerships for a number of reasons. We have never been ideologically committed to an idea that the State or local authorities should have a monopoly of public works. One of the great successes in Ireland has been the rather pragmatic approach that we have adopted from day one, going back to the 1920s, about State or semi-State enterprise. This is a new step in the same direction.</P>
      <P>Public private partnerships could be particularly successful in a number of areas. I agree with Deputy Bradford's points. The affordable housing scheme is an area which should be vigorously examined in this regard. We have a situation in Wicklow where the local authority has a number of successful affordable housing schemes in operation but there are not enough, particularly in the towns surrounding Dublin city and county. The scheme should be accelerated and a PPP would put off the opportunity to do so. The hysteria beginning to grow about PPPs and the roads area is not properly focused. If we allow that hysteria to cloud reality we will end up with a situation, as we have on many previous occasions, which prevents us from making the progress we need to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there will have to be a serious examination of small town by-passes and shadow tolling. As Deputy Bradford said, the idea of <Col N="1412" /> building toll booths on a small by-pass does not make sense. There has been huge road development in France particularly, in which the small section of road which surrounds a city is left either toll free or with shadow tolling. That will have to be the situation here also. Another speaker referred to our small land mass, saying tolling raises fundamental questions. Shadow tolling may be the answer.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some speakers on waste management. Coming from Wicklow, I am familiar with the privations of the private sector in this regard, particularly when it is left to its own devices. I suggest we enter this particular area very carefully. The recent dumping problem in Wicklow, which is now an epidemic, is caused by private Dublin operators, some of them very large operators. I will not name them but looking at one of them recently I was alarmed to find the company had remarkably few assets. When the gardaí, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other State authorities move in on this &ldquo;operator&rdquo;, there will be very little to be seized. When the Litter Act comes into operation and £10 million fines and prison sentences are handed out, I fear that some amadán who has allowed his land to be used will suffer rather than the real culprits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made the point that in waste management we should look at incineration, recycling and an enclosed cycle. I draw the attention of the House to the PPP model operated in Denmark in this regard which is very interesting. Small municipalities there tend to own combined heat and power plants, usually built outside cities, which are involved in recycling, material recovery and converting waste to heat. It is a fully integrated process and has been supported by budgetary measures, which means there is a tax yield for recycling. It is a complex process but we could examine it with a view to addressing the issue of waste management and converting waste to heat. This would solve some problems in my constituency which have been all too evident in recent months. I draw the line at the absolute privatisation of waste collection services. I have seen its future and that future does not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I have mixed views on public private partnerships. The concept is good but the public, those who invest, are entitled to a fair share of the action afterwards. Deputy Dukes mentioned the M50. I have watched that bridge for some years and the toll started at 70p, then went to £1, to £1.50 and £3 for trucks and so forth. A toll of that nature is a licence to print money, particularly if interest rates drop. Obviously there are swings and roundabouts according to the contract but it is a licence to print money. When that concept is extended throughout the country that will be fine but we should not forget something: land acquisition by order is fine for public utilities but whether one has a large or small input from the private sector, the outcome should be to the <Col N="1413" /> benefit of the consumer in the long run. If not, we will have problems.</P>
      <P>The problem of waste management must be addressed. Everyone says everything can be recycled but that cannot be done and we will never be able to do so. There is no sense in having this as a soft option in the hope that it will work out some day. It will not work out and we will have to provide appropriate facilities.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with land acquisition for roads and motorways, which is necessary and must be done. However, I do not understand why local roads, which facilitate the people of the area, cannot be left alone. New roads can go over or under those local roads but I cannot understand stopping existing roads in the middle of nowhere to create a <i>cul de sac</i> in order to cut costs for those designing the new road. Surely it is simple to work out a formula whereby existing roads are left alone and those travelling them all their lives are allowed to use them in the normal way. That should be an essential ingredient in the whole question of land acquisition throughout the country. It would also get the co-operation of those whose property is encroached upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I hope that the level of interest shown in the provisions of this legislation is matched by the level of PPP projects entered into by State authorities throughout the country. I am encouraged by how well informed the contributions have been and I hope it has proved informative for those who are following the debate outside of this House.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of this Bill some months ago, the Minister for Finance has received a number of representations in relation to its provisions. These contacts have come from Members and from a range of interests in both the public and private sectors. I am pleased that most of these have been both positive and constructive. The Government is in agreement with certain suggestions made in relation to the Bill, some of which have been raised here on Second Stage. Accordingly, as a result of representations received, together with the need to make technical amendments to the Bill, the Government will be submitting a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the delay in introducing the Second Stage debate. We have had a huge raft of important legislation before the House and I am glad this Bill has passed Second Stage. Deputies Finucane, Dukes, Bradford and McDowell raised the question of tolling. In the <Col N="1414" /> first instance, statutory responsibility in this area rests with the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act, 1993. The NRA has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of construction and maintenance of national roads. Specifically in relation to tolls, section 57 of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000, allows the NRA to establish a system of tolls in respect of the use of a public road. The NRA may also enter into a PPP to procure a public road and toll charges may be used to repay all or part of the private funding involved.</P>
    <P>The key principles for selecting PPP schemes for road projects are an alternative route must be available, an Exchequer contribution will be available for high cost schemes to ensure that tolls are set at affordable levels, tolled roads will be spread throughout the network and tolled roads must deliver value for money. It is worth noting that there are tolls on more than one third of the 50,000 kilometres of motorway in Europe. Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece benefit from the EU Cohesion Fund, the objective of which is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in EU member states. All the Cohesion Fund countries have embarked on a major programme of road investment, a key element of which is PPP schemes financed by user tolling.</P>
    <P>Shadow tolling is not part of the National Roads Authority's pilot PPP project for roads. In the United Kingdom and Portugal, some PPP roads projects have incorporated shadow toll schemes broadly along the lines suggested by Deputy McGrath. The experience of other countries suggests that shadow tolling can be very costly for the Exchequer. The polluter pays principle is absent in shadow tolling. On this issue, as with many others which arise under public private partnership, we will continue to learn from the pilot project process as individual projects are rolled out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford raised the matter of the Fermoy road and asked specifically about the bypass. I have summarised the benefits of tolling and they can be applied to the Fermoy scheme. Approaches that include tolling can assist the financing of road projects, are consistent with the polluter pays principle and help to incentivise delivery and quality maintenance over the full 25-year concession.</P>
    <P>Deputies McGrath and McDowell referred to the question of land, particularly farmland, compulsorily acquired for roads and other infrastructure projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>From slightly different angles, it must be said, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the matter. The question of compensatory payments for farmland compulsorily acquired arises irrespective of the method of procurement. The issue is not exclusive to the PPP process and cannot be resolved in the context of this Bill alone, although there is <Col N="1415" /> merit in many of the remarks that have been made. The House is probably aware that a final agreement has recently been proposed following lengthy discussions, aimed at resolving the issues surrounding access to farmland for the national roads programme. The proposed agreement is before the IFA and the National Roads Authority. I look forward to its adoption by both sides in the House so that progress on the important programme of improvements to the roads network can continue without further delay.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy McGrath's concerns in relation to the importance of proceeding without avoidable delay with priority roads projects under the national roads programme. An aggressive schedule was set for the delivery of such projects when the PPP pilot roads projects were selected and I am glad the NRA is generally keeping to this schedule. The N4 route between Kilcock and Kinnegad and the Waterford bridge project are at tender stage and bids are due in February 2002. It is important to note that the projects must undergo the appropriate statutory planning processes.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath also asked about road safety standards in the PPP roads projects and I can offer the House some assurance in that matter. Survey results show that motorways and dual carriageways, which will be delivered under PPP roads projects, are significantly safer than conventional single carriageway roads. PPP incentives should ensure the concessionaire maintains the road quality at a higher level than has been the case with conventional procurement.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised some union issues, including the pay and conditions of employees. I have already mentioned the part that partnership has played in the development of the PPP process. The participation of, and consensus reached with, the social partners has facilitated the development of the PPP process and has ensured that the issues raised by Deputy McDowell have been addressed. The framework for public private partnerships, to which I have referred, includes a specific provision for consultation with stakeholders. It states that all parties to a PPP arrangement should have regard to appropriate industry norms in terms of pay and conditions and prevailing national and industry agreements, including health and safety regulations. The framework provides that such an approach should be consistent with protections provided under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employees) Regulations and the acquired rights directive. In general, PPPs should be approached on the basis that no less favourable terms than the transfer of undertakings regulations apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand and appreciate the concerns expressed in relation to pensions. It is a complex and highly technical matter which requires comprehensive examination to address the various issues involved. While I agree that action is required, it is not appropriate to take such action <Col N="1416" /> in the Bill before the House. The Bill's function is to establish the vires of State authorities to enter into PPP arrangements, not to deal with the rights of individual employees of the authorities. I repeat that partnership is at the heart of the PPP process and it has played a vital role in reaching consensus on issues on which agreement was not thought possible. Discussions have taken place with the social partners on the question of pensions and contact will continue in an effort to achieve a mutually acceptable resolution. The Government is conscious of the absolute need to preserve the pension rights of employees transferring from the public service.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy McDowell's concerns that the PPP message has not been communicated sufficiently throughout the trade union movement. I am pleased to inform the House that the central PPP unit of the Department of Finance, in conjunction with IBEC, ICTU and the CIF, is undertaking an extensive campaign aimed at raising awareness and increasing communications. This communications strategy is being rolled out on a regional basis over the coming months and I look forward to the fullest participation throughout the regions. I was pleased to be in Cork earlier this week to speak at the launch the first of a series of nationwide PPP information seminars. Speeches were also made by a senior official from my Department and by representatives of IBEC, ICTU and the CIF. It was a harmonious event, which enlightened all present and I look forward to further seminars.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy McDowell's support of the principle of PPPs and I agree with him that it is essential to establish a value for money benefit to the Exchequer from PPPs. It is true that development of the private finance initiative in the United Kingdom was motivated by different objectives, but I suggest that, in some respects, the UK is moving closer to the PPP model being developed here in Ireland. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and Ireland has learnt from the experience of private finance initiatives in the UK and other countries. We have used the experience to build a better PPP process in this country. A critical element of the process in Ireland is the commitment of Government. Solid Government support for PPPs has helped us to make good progress at the highest level. This support is grounded in a clear appreciation of the economic case for individual PPPs and a focus on deliverables, based on a requirement for a sound business case evaluation.</P>
    <P>As I have said several times, partnership is a key element of the success of public private partnership in Ireland. We will not stand still as the PPP process develops. The structures for delivering PPPs are crucially important and the Government has taken care, in developing the process in conjunction with the social partners, to put in place a workable framework within which the process can be delivered. The PPP framework requires a comprehensive and regular review of the overall process together with continuous <Col N="1417" /> monitoring of its implementation. As I mentioned on the first day of this debate, the coming together of public services and private business is not new. We have not traditionally relied on monopolies for the provision of essential public services, such as health and State education, as they have been funded and provided through a mix of central and local government and private, voluntary and community based organisations. Many local authority services have been provided through contract arrangements with the private sector. PPPs are consistent with these long-standing practices.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has extensive experience of PPP projects, having designed, constructed or maintained many public buildings, including Garda stations, prisons and Government offices. The Office of Public Works' recent experiences with arts, culture and heritage projects mean it can bring a wealth of experience to the new method of public procurement represented by PPP.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned the financial cost of PPPs and it is true the Government can borrow at lower interest rates. That is only part of the story, however, as there are advantages other than accelerated delivery, which was mentioned by the Deputy. Better value for money can be found through the allocation of risk to parties best able to manage it. Full life cycle costs can be brought below conventional project levels and room can be made for private sector innovation and expertise by linking design and construction to finance and the long-term operation of the project.</P>
    <P>Environmental, health and waste management issues have been suggested by Deputies as suitable for public private partnerships. I welcome such contributions and I respond to them by confirming that the Government has an open mind regarding the wide range of approaches that can be taken. We are learning from the experience of other projects, so that we would not, for example, approach the West Link Bridge project in the same manner if the deal was to be done again. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Sixth Progress Report by The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on the referendum made a number of recommendations on the provision of information at referenda. Principal among these were proposals to amend the functions of a Referendum Commission including removing the role of presenting the arguments for and against a proposal, providing a new power to allocate finance equally among pro and anti sides and a recommendation to provide additional functions to promote voter participation. These and other matters have been considered by the Government which have decided to bring forward this short Bill to implement a number of the recommendations in the all-party report.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the provisions of the Bill, I will make a number of general points regarding the conduct of referenda. Referenda are important. They provide a mechanism to change the fundamental law of the State and the electorate, as guardians of that law, has a crucial role to play. That any amendment to the Constitution requires a referendum offers the electorate the opportunity to express its opinion on political and constitutional issues.</P>
      <P>Since 1937, the Constitution has been amended following a referendum on 19 different proposals. Six proposals have been rejected, most recently regarding the Treaty of Nice, demonstrating that the electorate can be discerning on issues put before it. Apathy, low turn-out and an under-informed electorate, perhaps leading to a large number of spoilt votes, serve only to devalue the primacy of the Constitution. The arrangements for referenda must provide for the information needs of voters and, at the same time, encourage voter participation to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been changes in the conduct of referendum campaigns over the years, most noticeably in terms of the tendency for cross-party support for proposals and an increase in interest group participation. At a statutory level, there have also been developments. In terms of the statutory provision of information, the Referendum Act, 1994, provides: that copies of the Constitution amendment Bill may be inspected or <Col N="1419" /> obtained, free of charge, at any post office; a statement, prescribed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, is printed on polling cards, sent to every elector, and displayed on posters at polling stations; the order of the Minister appointing polling day must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; public notice must be given by the local returning officer for each constituency stating the date and hours of polling and indicating that copies of the Constitution amendment Bill may be inspected or obtained, free, at any post office; and a polling card must be sent to each elector, other than postal and special voters, indicating the elector's number on the register, the location of the polling station and the date and hours of voting.</P>
    <P>The provisions under the 1994 Act are, in a sense, the formal statutory requirements regarding informing the public about the polling day and hours of polling, together with the terms of the proposed amendment. They could probably be best characterised as basic information provisions which, although necessary, are unlikely to impact decisively in terms of informing the public.</P>
    <P>The provision of information was developed at the divorce, bail and Cabinet confidentiality referenda. A number of <i>ad hoc</i> commissions, comprised of the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad, were established to oversee the preparation of statements setting out the arguments for and against the proposal at each referendum.</P>
    <P>Against the legal backdrop of the McKenna judgments the Referendum Act, 1998, was enacted. It was designed to put the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions on a statutory footing and to further advance the issue of providing information to the electorate. Specifically, the Act provided for the establishment of an independent statutory Referendum Commission whose primary role is to explain the subject matter of the referendum to the population at large, as simply and effectively as possible, while ensuring that the arguments of those against the proposed amendment and those in favour are put forward in a way that is fair to all interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The question that needs to be addressed following the developments that I have outlined is whether the operation of referendum information campaigns, especially informing the electorate of the proposal and motivating them to express their opinion at the ballot box, has improved. The answer, or at least part of it, is that despite the endeavours of <i>ad hoc</i> commissions and the Referendum Commission, turnout and participation have been disappointing and there is a consensus that the manner in which referendum information campaigns are conducted is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there is no perfect solution to this problem. During the debate on the Referendum Act, 1998 the point was made that each change was an attempt to improve matters and if the changes were found wanting, then the issue would be revisited. Different types of solutions are pro<Col N="1420" /> vided for internationally, but none are perfect. In Ireland we must have regard to the Constitution and Supreme Court judgments in considering possible solutions.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Commission, in its report on the referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and Northern Ireland Agreement, referred to the difficulty in getting the message across to the electorate as the following passage from the report indicates:</P>
    <P>There was a clear pattern which suggested that the average person has become quite lazy when it means reading or helping oneself to information and there is a high level of reliance on media broadcasts rather than the written word. The effect of TV and radio coverage made them at least feel informed and exposed them to the issues. Those who did take the trouble to read the written material scored it highly in terms of balance and fairness (62%) and for its usefulness in decision making (53%). It was also felt to be easy to read and understand and gave an unbiased view of the issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to state on behalf of the Government that the amendments proposed in the Bill are not a reflection on the commission members or their staff, who have carried out their functions in a satisfactory manner for the six referenda for which they have been established. This is especially true when one has regard to the complexity of the referendum proposals relating to the EU and the subject matter of the other proposals where engaging the electorate was always likely to be difficult.</P>
    <P>In summary, the impact of the statutory provision of information under the Referendum Act, 1994, is small. The McKenna judgment has narrowed the parameters within which Government can promote, with public funds, its views on a proposal. The rationale of the Coughlan judgment is that RTE breaches its statutory duty of objectivity and impartiality if it allows political parties and other bodies, which support a particular referendum outcome, a considerable advantage in the broadcasting of partisan material. The format of information provision via the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions and the Referendum Commission has been criticised as anodyne and ineffective notwithstanding the valuable work undertaken by these bodies in accordance with their non-statutory and statutory briefs. The Bill before the House addresses a number of these issues and I will now outline the changes proposed.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Referendum Act, 1998, and contains two sections. Section 2 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and construction while section 1 provides for the substantive change.</P>
    <P>Section 1(<i>a</i>) replaces section 3(1) of the Referendum Act, 1998, which sets out the functions of a Referendum Commission. This section removes the current functions available to the Referendum Commission to prepare statements setting <Col N="1421" /> out the arguments for and against a proposal and to foster and promote debate. It also provides a new function of promoting awareness of the referendum, including encouraging the electorate to vote.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the work of the Referendum Commission which has been subject to most criticism has been its function to present arguments for and against a proposal. This provision was drafted as a result of the McKenna judgment and sought to bring equity of approach in terms of the balanced provision of information. However, there is general agreement that the provision has not been a total success. The alignment of arguments for and against a proposal in an almost sterilised format has not encouraged debate and can result in seemingly equal weightings been given to alternative arguments which do not merit equivalent comparison, in any rational assessment.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution refers to this in its report in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The committee agrees that the commission should provide information but does not believe that it should have any direct responsibility for putting the arguments for and against a referendum proposal. It is understandable that such a function should have been given to the commission in response to the McKenna judgment. However, the political needs of a referendum cannot be met by setting before the electorate two lists of arguments, all of them detached from the contexts that give them sense and weight, in an effort to be even-handed. That leads to leaden rather than lively presentation. It also leads to confusion because while the voter must arrive at a summative judgment, he or she has no means of measuring the weight to be given to each of the arguments presented in this way. The engagement of the commission directly in the campaign tends to weaken the sense that the political parties and the interest groups should be the protagonists in the debate.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, to remove this function from future commissions, who will nonetheless retain their powers to prepare statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and the power to publish and distribute such information as they see fit.</P>
    <P>The second amendment provides for a new power for referendum commissions to promote public awareness of the referendum and to encourage as many people as possible to vote. It is difficult to examine the problem of referendum information and turnout in isolation from the wider problem of voter turnout and indifference towards the political system. Political participation generally has been declining and the downturn in interest in referendums cannot be seen separately from the more general trend. An independent body such as a referendum commission is ideally placed to undertake these <Col N="1422" /> additional functions. The format of the information campaigns will be a matter for each commission, which will continue to have all the powers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions under the Referendum Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>The amendments at section 1(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are consequential on the change of functions proposed in paragraph (<i>a</i>). Paragraph (<i>b</i>) repeals section 6 of the Referendum Act, 1998, which provides that a person may make a submission to the commission about the proposal of the subject of the referendum. This section is directly related to the function of preparing a statement of arguments for and against the proposal in the existing paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) and it will not be required following the earlier amendment. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) makes consequential amendments to section 8 of the 1998 Act, which concerns the publication of notices by a referendum commission. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the existing section 8 refers to notices informing people that they can make submissions to a commission. The other two amendments are consequential.</P>
    <P>I refer to the proposal in the Oireachtas All-Party Committee report recommending the allocation of funds to campaign groups promoting both sides during a referendum. The Government has decided not to proceed with the recommendation at this stage. It is a radical proposal which has been raised before but which requires careful examination in the context of the relevant Supreme Court judgments and the difficulties with the practical application of such a scheme in the context of those judgments. These difficulties have been acknowledged by the 1998 Referendum Commission in their report on the Amsterdam and Northern Ireland referendums. In that report the commission commented on the introduction of such a scheme as follows:</P>
    <P>From its experience, the commission would see considerable difficulties in ensuring compliance with the McKenna [judgment] and avoiding litigation.</P>
    <P>Many matters need to be addressed. How should the funds be divided? Should both sides be funded equally or at the discretion of the commission based on statutory criteria? What would be the information role of the referendum commission? Should a commission with a function of funding both sides be activated in all referendums? What conditions should be attached to such funding without interfering with a group's advocacy strategy? Would political parties be able to avail of finance? Could an individual get funding? How large would a group have to be to receive funding? How is the taxpayers' money to be accounted for? Are there different levels of information and public debate requirements?</P>
    <P>We might ask even more fundamental questions. Would the electorate be any the wiser after being deluged with conflicting information? Would more information prove to be a greater turn-off for the electorate? Would the taxpayer be in favour of the use of their money by the <Col N="1423" /> Government, political parties, pressure groups and individuals to persuade them to vote yes or no? I raise these questions not to be obstructive, but simply to highlight some of the complexities that would require careful consideration if such a scheme was to be adopted. I note also that the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution had difficulty with this matter. A minority of the committee took the view that funds should be divided equally between the two sides as a matter of principle, while a majority were of the view that the division should be on the basis of what was equitable rather than what was equal.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the quality of the judgment that the electorate expresses at a referendum is, among other things, a function of the quality of the information available to them and this Bill will allow referendum commissions to focus on the provision of information in an objective way rather than an approach based on arguments for and against, which has proved to be problematic. The Bill will also seek to encourage awareness and political participation by providing future referendum commissions with a specific remit in this area. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the Bill I want to express, on behalf of Fine Gael and the Irish people, my absolute outrage at the affront that this Bill represents to the Constitution and the way changes to the Constitution are dealt with. I do not know how the Minister can justify introducing a Bill at 24 hours notice and passing it through both Houses of the Oireachtas on the last day of the session. Many Members of this House do not even know about this Bill as it only appeared on the Order Paper yesterday. One must be suspicious about the Government's motives for doing this at the last moment, on the last day before the Christmas holidays. We are not dealing with a national emergency. The difficulties surrounding the McKenna judgment and our method of complying with that judgment are well known and have been for some time. Are we having a referendum at the beginning of January? Why is this suddenly so urgent that it has not been subject to the debate that is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution comprises our basic fundamental laws, which are the building blocks of all our other laws. They inform our values and dictate the kind of society we have. How we promote, manage and operate a referendum to amend those basic laws is absolutely critical to the outcome. Any change, addition or deletion can, and usually does, impact across a whole range of laws and therefore has huge ramifications for Government. In some cases it can alter the whole direction of social change. Referendums are critically important and the only opportunity available to the public to change these basic laws directly and fundamentally. It is <Col N="1424" /> crucial that referendums are carried out in a fair and legal way which gives honest and accurate information about the purpose and impact of any change proposed.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Act, 1998, gave for the first time a statutory basis to a referendum commission which hitherto had operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The Act gave functions to the commission which sought to ensure that the referendum procedure in future was carried out in accordance with the McKenna judgment. There were many ways to do this and many would agree that the way that was chosen was not necessarily the right one. At the time of the last referendum, on the Nice Treaty, the way in which the commission was obliged to manage and portray the arguments was little short of farcical. Far from clarifying the issue, it served in many ways merely to confuse the public. I do not believe that the low turnout was entirely due to voter apathy. It was mostly due to bewilderment &ndash; how could it be otherwise when voters were treated every night to diametrically opposed views which clearly came from the same source?</P>
    <P>Giving the pros and cons of a proposition had some appeal as a fair and unbiased way of communicating information and of advocating both points of view equally. However, it was neither in the case of the Nice Treaty. Whatever about equal advocacy, it did not communicate information satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Not every argument has a counter argument, and if it has, it is sometimes so contrived as to be ludicrous. More importantly, there are many possible constitutional amendments which do not and never will lend themselves either to explanation or advocacy in that particularly argumentative manner.</P>
    <P>Several of the amendments arising from EU membership were based on the acceptance of highly complex international treaties and it would have been meaningless, if not impossible, to try to line up a series of arguments for and against. Ironically, the Nice Treaty was not one of the more complex treaties. While it dealt with technical issues such as the weighting of votes, qualified majorities, rotating commissioners and so forth, its underlying intent was to facilitate enlargement. The Amsterdam Treaty was complex and required cross-referencing with other international treaties.</P>
    <P>Let us imagine, with horror, how the 25th amendment might have to be portrayed if each and every word, line and clause in the Bill had to be assigned pro and anti arguments. It would not help in the clarification of the issues and might even confuse the public further. It would be hugely divisive to even try to portray it in that way.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why this Bill is being rushed through the House but I have my suspicions. If it is to facilitate an early referendum on the 25th amendment, this Bill as proposed presents immediate problems. The main functions of the commission will be to prepare one or more state<Col N="1425" /> ments containing a general explanation of the subject matter. Will the Minister tell me how the commission can be expected to do that accurately when there is no agreement, even in this House, as to what is the subject matter of the Bill? Not alone do we not have consensus on the issues, we do no even have consensus on what precisely are the facts of the Bill to go before the people. Pro-life groups are already predicting interpretations other than those intended by the authors of the Bill. How will the commission, in attempting to disseminate information, overcome that conundrum? One can already envisage the commission being brought before the courts in the middle of the campaign because one side or the other will claim it got the facts wrong and is attempting to mislead the public.</P>
    <P>In attempting to comply with the McKenna judgment, the Minister, and all of us to some extent, have wrapped ourselves in knots, in some ways unnecessarily. The main constitutional implications of the conduct of referenda deriving from the various judicial decisions that have been made recently were summed up in the sixth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It stated that: the people are the exclusive decision makers; they are entitled to reach their decision free from unauthorised interference by organs of the State; the Government may not spend public money to support only one side of a referendum because that would be contrary to the requirement to fair procedures and is an infringement of the concept of equality; and once a referendum Bill has passed, the Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the political parties have no special claim on public funds. If public funds are made available they must be expended equally on pro and anti campaigns. The report continued that in a referendum RTE may not allocate free broadcast time to political parties in such a way that the broadcasts are weighted in favour of one side; and that politicians who think the Constitution should be amended have the right and duty, individually or as members of a political party or of the Government, to attempt to persuade their fellow citizens to adopt the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>In fact the McKenna judgment is quite restricted. It refers only to the use of public money and it is clear on the prohibition of the use of public money only when exclusively used for the promotion of one side of the proposition. The all-party committee called it a purely negative injunction and said that on the face of it it should not present compliance problems. Problems arise from other implications of the various judicial decisions, primarily the positive injunction that politicians who are of the view that the Constitution should be amended have not only a right, but a duty, as individuals or members of a political party or as a Government to attempt to persuade their fellow citizens to adopt a proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is entirely silent on how we might do that and that really is the nub of the problem. <Col N="1426" /> Finance is certainly one aspect of it and the all-party committee made recommendations about the equal dispensing of funds between the pro and anti sides. This Bill has ignored that issue and we have had no debate on it, and now we do not have any opportunity to debate it. Even more important is how either side can communicate their viewpoint in the absence of any meaningful access to the airwaves.</P>
    <P>The judgment in the Coughlan case is being totally misinterpreted by the national broadcaster. The judgment was that free broadcast air time should be equally distributed between both sides, not that the normal political debate and the cut and thrust of argument and counter-argument should be entirely prohibited, or be so circumscribed as to be meaningless.</P>
    <P>During the last referendum, RTE operated what appeared to be a nonsensical equality of time regime, down to the last second. There were repeated instances of people being cut off mid-sentence. I do not believe that was either the intention of the Supreme Court or the intention of Mr. Coughlan when he brought that case. If brought to its logical conclusion in a case where each side was allocated an hour to put its arguments and one side ran out of arguments after ten minutes the other side would also have to be equally curtailed and this would clearly deprive the public of information.</P>
    <P>We all know how much power the media have and its reach in getting in touch with the public. This is the principal way in which the public get their information and I believe it is the principal way in which we form our judgments on issues having heard the arguments offered and debated on both sides. The last referendum showed that the print media, both in the newspapers and the information issued by the Referendum Commission, simply did not have an impact on the public. As the Minister said, it did not even generate a debate. At the end of the day most people were no further enlightened and indeed were more confused in most cases. I am sure that if anybody had either the time or the interest to test the fact that debate is curtailed, by going to court, it would be found unconstitutional to stifle the normal flow of political debate which is how we inform ourselves on all issues. This is particularly crucial when it comes to changing the Constitution. This is another aspect on which the Bill is silent and on which we have had no public debate and now we do not have the time to have it either.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the requirement to have the commission argue the pros and cons of any case makes good sense. Most people would agree with it, but it is not necessarily a foregone conclusion that this should also involve removing the right of approved bodies to make submissions to the commission. These concerns could be relayed to the public by means other than the formula used in the last referendum, simply by incorporating them into the information role of the commission.</P>
    <P>There has been much political criticism of the <Col N="1427" /> McKenna judgment both in this House and in the media. It is not the judgment itself that is causing the problem but the method being used to comply with it. This Government is using the problems we all agree surround the chosen method of compliance to tailor a scenario whereby they can minimise the information to the public in the context of the 25th amendment. In this way the Government hopes to portray the purpose and impact of the abortion Bill as being what they interpret it to be. Why else would they remove one method of compliance in providing information but not replace it with another through funding or by way of facilitating public and media debate? I warn the Minister that if this is the intention &ndash; I suspect it is because there is no other explanation for the speed with which this is being put through the House &ndash; he is embarking on a very rocky road of attempting to artificially set up a situation which is geared specifically to favour the passing of one particular constitutional amendment. It may suit the Government's purposes on this occasion but there will be future referenda where it will not suit to stifle information, which is what this Bill will do.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to play with our Constitution in this way. The Constitution belongs to the people and they have the sole right to change it but we in this House have the sole right to initiate proposed changes and we therefore have a responsibility to protect not only the Constitution but the procedures used to amend it in any way and at any time whether it suits us or not. This is a prime responsibility of Parliament and we cannot be expected to deal with it in a two hour debate on the last day of the session with 24 hours notice to prepare for it.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party will vote against the Bill. We will not offer amendments because it would be impossible to produce meaningful and thoughtful amendments at 24 hours' notice. More importantly, to even attempt to do so would be to condone and even reinforce the affront this ill-timed Bill poses to the Constitution. We will not be complicit in such an insult to the people and the Constitution. It is too important to us all to treat such changes in our basic and fundamental law in this way. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill and allow it the consideration it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is outrageous in the context of legislation dealing with the manner in which referendums are conducted that a Bill should be published on a Wednesday and the Government should put it through all Stages in this House by guillotine on a Friday. My 20 years of experience as a Member of this House has taught me that when important legislation is rushed through, with the Government expecting the Houses of the Oireachtas to rubber stamp its proposal, it inevitably leads to constitutional challenges and legislative disaster. I predict this Bill will do the same. If the procedure I will propose should not be <Col N="1428" /> invoked, it is inevitable that the Bill will, at an early stage, be the subject of a constitutional challenge which will derail the Government's intent to progress the referendum proposal that has been guillotined through the House over the last two weeks.</P>
      <P>This whole area, dealing with the provision of information and campaigning by the Government, groups and individuals on referenda, has been the subject of difficult and complex litigation in the courts. On occasion the courts, especially in the McKenna (No. 2) judgment, which has had such a dramatic impact, have found themselves constrained by time in reaching rapid conclusions in proceedings that should have been dealt with in a manner that did not put them under pressure. It was no fault of the courts that they found themselves under pressure, it was a consequence of the manner in which the litigation occurred.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for consideration pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution. We should not again find ourselves in a position where the Government orders that a referendum takes place and in the middle of a referendum campaign, both the High Court and the Supreme Court find themselves, at very short notice, within time constraints having to pronounce on the constitutionality or otherwise of legislation or of procedures adopted by the Government. A referral of the Bill by the President to the Supreme Court would have interesting and important consequences. The Supreme Court should, by use of the Article 26 mechanism, be given space and time to consider the constitutional arguments that arise on the Bill. Such a case would also give the Supreme Court an opportunity to further reflect on the McKenna (No. 2) judgment and other judgments that have been delivered which impact on the manner in which referenda can be funded and which constrain the role Governments and public finances can play in ensuring that people are fully informed of what referendum proposals contain and the substantive impact they may have if they are successful.</P>
      <P>On 19 November, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Tom O'Higgins, published an interesting and detailed analysis of the McKenna judgment and why he believed, as a former Chief Justice, that the Supreme Court got it wrong. In his article he referred to the divorce referendum campaign and he stated:</P>
      <P>I believe that the existence of this campaign led the judges in the wrong direction and that they lost sight of the true question before them which was whether the promotion of a publicity campaign by the Government was an unjustified interference with the rights of voters. The hearing before the court was necessarily rushed because of the currency of the campaign and the judgments in my view were given too hastily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> Referring to the majority judgment delivered by the members of the court he stated:</P>
    <P>In their judgments it seems to me these judges overlooked the fact that the right to vote which they had to consider was the personal right of each qualified voter as laid down in the Constitution. Instead they confused or equated this personal right, exercisable only on polling day, with the right of voters and all citizens to join in a pre-poll campaign, if such were taking place, in which all aspects of the question to be decided on polling day could be discussed and argued.</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>If it appears to the Government that the proposed amendment is not fully understood by the generality of voters or that its effect has been misrepresented, I believe it to be the duty of the Government to step into the campaign to correct the position and to do so in the manner considered in McKenna.</P>
    <P>He concluded his article by wondering how this matter can come again before the Supreme Court and he suggested this could be done by a referendum Bill coming before this House which might be referred to the Supreme Court for its consideration.</P>
    <P>In the case of the conduct of all referenda and regardless of whether I agree or disagree with the views of the Government on a proposition and on the basis that it represents the majority view in this House, where a Government believes it is in the national interest that a proposal be put to the people and be effectively accepted by them with the result that the Constitution is amended, it should be able to argue in favour of that proposal as the Government. The courts should not step into that area and effectively muzzle the Government, as one democratically elected in this State, from encouraging people to vote in a particular way in a referendum. Had that been the case prior to the McKenna judgment I doubt if we would ever have joined the European Union.</P>
    <P>There are complexities in proposals to be put to the people which, if not fully argued and explained by the Government, result in the public and the electorate, no matter how well informed, inevitably becoming unnecessarily confused. Those who hold minority views that do not deserve to be given weight because they lack credibility and substance are given equal standing with the true position. In the Nice Treaty referendum this led to the ultimate absurdity where one campaign slogan read &ldquo;if you do not know vote no.&rdquo;  It was based on the proposition that if the maximum confusion was created it would ensure that, whatever the proposal, the majority of voters will either not vote for it or they will become so confused that they will not vote at all.</P>
    <P>This is a very important issue and it is regrettable it must be addressed in a brief debate in this House. Although I disagree with the view of the Government in the context of the referendum <Col N="1430" /> this Bill is designed to deal with, in that the proposition on the abortion issue the Government proposes to put to the people is wrong headed and inimical to women, I nevertheless recognise that the Government, as Government, should have the right to argue in its favour. In view of the McKenna judgment I have concerns about the constitutionality of this Bill. It should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court so that we do not have a constitutional challenge in the middle of another referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>The referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court would create the possibility of revisiting the issues dealt with previously by the court in McKenna and give the court the opportunity to consider the type of propositions that a distinguished former Chief Justice considered he should write about in response to the consequences of the McKenna judgment.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with certain matters in relation to the Bill and we may return to them in the very brief time allowed for Committee and Report Stages. The Minister needs to explain an aspect of the Bill for which I have waited with interest. The Bill is designed to ensure we no longer have the ridiculous situation whereby the commission is compelled to publish &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; arguments and, no matter how ludicrous the arguments are on either side, to give them equal weight and equal credibility. That was a huge waste of public funds; it was an exercise that caused widespread confusion and I believe it undermined the public credibility of the commission through no fault of anybody involved in that commission. Effectively, it resulted in members of the Bar Library, late at night, being compelled to invent tortuous arguments in a public relations user friendly fashion to install in full page public advertisements that no right minded person had the capacity to read through or, if they did, they ended up less informed than when they started.</P>
    <P>This Bill lays a trap for the commission. Section 1(a) (i) states: &ldquo;The Commission shall have, in addition to any functions conferred on it by any other provision of this Act, the following principal functions relating to the referendum in respect of which it is established: (a) To prepare one or more statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and of the text thereof in the relevant Bill&rdquo;. What does that mean? I ask the Minister to give us an example of what general explanation of the subject matter of the referendum proposal the Government envisages &ndash; or at least the Fianna Fáil wing of it, the Progressive Democrats are vacillating because they want to have a foot in every camp in case they get into trouble in the next general election &ndash; of a simplistic nature that the commission can publish when there are so many complexities involved and so many disparate possible interpretations. Will we simply see a statement saying, if you believe a pregnant suicidal raped teenager should not be allowed to have an abortion in Ireland, vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; if you believe <Col N="1431" /> a pregnant suicidal raped teenager should be allowed to have an abortion in Ireland, vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;? </P>
    <P>Is that the simple proposition we will see or will there be a page of text trying to explain the Bill the Government intends to put through the House and about which there are disparate interpretations as to the situation should the referendum succeed? The moment any advertisement is published by the commission with the type of statement envisaged, if we have not had a constitutional issue before then, on the basis of a presidential referral, it will arise at that point. One or other group campaigning in the referendum or an individual on one side or the other will inevitably be offended by the statement published and will challenge it under McKenna 2. In the middle of a referendum campaign, we will have a High Court and Supreme Court adjudication on the issue and the commission will suddenly be devoid of power to publish anything because it will be put on hold pending the outcome of the court case.</P>
    <P>The proposal being rushed through this House is a classic example of the Government, when in a hole, digging further. It will not work in the way it is set out. I believe there will be a serious question mark over the validity of any referendum called while the constitutionality of this measure remains uncertain. There will be total confusion as to what the commission can and cannot do and what the constraints on the Government are or are not. We will be back to where we were in the Nice referendum, with a Government incapable of explaining, as Government, what the particular referendum proposal was about. Perhaps a couple of Ministers will stick their heads above the parapet while the rest of the Members on the Government side of the House keep their heads down for fear of doing themselves damage in their pending general election campaign. The Progressive Democrats will point in all directions. My Dublin South colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the sake of re-establishing her credentials with the electorate in the constituency I have the privilege to represent with my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, will probably have second thoughts and announce that she is really a &ldquo;no&rdquo; voter but came along to the press conference because of the collective responsibility she had as a Junior Minister and all the media will be amazed.</P>
    <P>It is time we dealt with fundamental legislation differently in this democratic Parliament. It is a disgrace that the Government is trying to push through this measure within two hours on the last day of sittings this term and deliberately organised for a time when it could be reasonably anticipated that not many members of the media would be present in the House to take much notice of this debate. It is the last sitting day before Christmas and it happens to coincide with lunchtime. A better advised Government, with a serious intent to address the issues set out in the <Col N="1432" /> very good and detailed report by Deputy Brian Lenihan's committee, would have published this Bill before Christmas, given everyone time to consider it and provided for a considered debate in the new year. There is no need for this hurry. The Government should change its mind and should not push through Second Stage today. If this matter is completed today, I believe it is in the national interest that this Bill be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for consideration as to its constitutionality prior to it being signed.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is not in the House to explain this Bill in person because some of the things I want to say about this Bill and how it has been introduced in this House relate directly to him. This House is faced again today with the pathetic reality behind the self-propagated image of this Government as a reforming one. The Bill before the House is a deceit. It does not deserve the support of this House and it will not have the support of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Before I turn to the import of the Bill, I would first like to address the manner in which the Bill is being taken. The decision to run this Bill through the Oireachtas on the very last day of this session is an undemocratic and contemptible act. However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who, I understand, is the principal author of the Bill, is a past master in using the Christmas season to bury controversial issues. Last year, as Members will recall, he introduced his famous electoral Bill around this time, the purpose of which was to allow Fianna Fáil to increase its electoral spend by nearly £1million in the next general election. It was only when Magill magazine, through the Freedom of Information Act, obtained background documents that we discovered the Bill was introduced at his direction and without research or advice to the effect that it should be introduced. It was a classic example of stroke politics, as is this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable that this House is being asked to run this legislation through in a couple of hours today. In a modern democracy, with a written Constitution, the process of referendum is a fundamental issue that goes to the very heart of democracy. The fact that this Government proposes a regressive change in the manner in which referenda are conducted is bad enough. However, this is compounded by the manner in which the Government has sought to pass this legislation today. The Minister's decision to steamroll this legislation through has already caused uproar in the Seanad this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> The way this Bill is being rammed through is beyond belief. Only emergency legislation, dealing with immediate matters of national security, is rushed through both Houses on the same day. That the Minister is intent on using the Government's majority to force this Bill through the House, with the minimum of parliamentary scrutiny, demonstrates that his so-called interest in electoral reform is a sham.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has deceived the House in the manner in which he has introduced this Bill. On Question Time on 6 December, he was asked specific and detailed questions on the referendum commission and the Government's response to the report of the all-party committee. In response to those questions he replied:</P>
    <P>These and other matters are under consideration in the context of whether to establish a commission for the forthcoming referendum on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution, under the existing legislation or under amended legislation. When the Government has made a decision on these matters an announcement will be made.</P>
    <P>He was then asked a succession of supplementary questions by Deputies Gormley, Clune and I. Deputy Gormley asked:</P>
    <P>Is he considering perhaps amending the legislation so that the commission will simply tell people the referendum is taking place and encourage them to vote, or is he considering amending the legislation so that the commission will distribute money equitably, which would mean the bigger parties would get most of it?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister, in the context of whether he intended to establish a referendum commission, &ldquo;. when does the Government intend to introduce amending legislation to provide some other means of allocating resources for that particular referendum campaign?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of his replies to those questions, at no stage did the Minister for the Environment and Local Government inform the House that he intended to introduce the Bill before us which is designed to amend the way the referendum commission does its work. I was so surprised at the extent to which he was being cautious in what he was telling the House that I put the following question to him. I asked:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously telling the House that a Government which decides everything on the basis of how it will run politically has not decided, a few working weeks before this referendum that has been promised for February, how the referendum campaign will be run and whether there will be a referendum commission?</P>
    <P>In response, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Gilmore, as soon as a decision is taken it will be communicated pub<Col N="1434" /> licly but no such decision has yet been taken. I would not presume to make a decision or to announce when the Government might make a decision on a particular matter.</P>
    <P>That was on 6 December.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us was published, printed and circulated on Tuesday, 11 December. Unless the Government spent the entire weekend discussing the matters with which the Bill deals, I do not believe it had the ability to in such a short period produce legislation about which the Minister remained silent despite being asked specific questions on the preceding Thursday. Following the publication of the Bill on Wednesday, I asked the Taoiseach when the Government had decided to bring it forward and he replied that it has &ldquo;been before the Government for the past few weeks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At no stage in replying to questions last week did the Minister for the Environment and Local Government inform the House that legislation was planned, that the heads were drafted, that they had been circulated and that the issue would come before Cabinet this week. In his reply eight days ago, the Minister misled this House. He engaged in an outrageous act of deceit that has resulted in this item of democratic sabotage, the so-called Referendum Bill, being rushed through the Oireachtas today. The truth behind the drafting and approval of this Bill has been shrouded in secrecy and kept from this House. What is being attempted today is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>When the veneer of respectability, which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, tried to maintain in his contribution, is swept aside, the real reason this legislation has been produced becomes all too clear. The Government is fearful about the democratic voice of the people since the vote on the Nice treaty. The Government, or at the very least the Fianna Fáil and Independent factions &ndash; on foot of the Minister of State's presence, the third leg of the stool may also be involved &ndash; are intent on foisting yet another abortion referendum on the country some time in the spring. This legislation is meant to clear the decks for that referendum. This legislation is formulated with one referendum in mind, namely, the forthcoming referendum on abortion.</P>
    <P>The referendum on abortion will present the Irish people with a bleak choice. When a vulnerable woman, perhaps the victim of a vicious sexual assault, is so disturbed that she contemplates suicide rather than bring a pregnancy to full-term, the Irish State will send her into exile in Britain. That is what the Irish people are being asked to support in the forthcoming referendum and, belatedly, the Government has realised that the Irish people may well reject its proposal. I sincerely hope they do.</P>
    <P>In an effort to avoid a second referendum defeat in the run up to a general election, the Government has introduced this legislation to stifle debate and protect its deeply flawed abortion proposals from sustained public scrutiny. That is the sole reason this legislation, which is inextricably linked to the abortion referendum, has been <Col N="1435" /> produced. That is confirmed by the reply of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to questions on the referendum commission when he stated that &ldquo;These and other matters are under consideration in the context of whether to establish a commission for the forthcoming referendum on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution&rdquo;. That reply proves the context for the Bill before us is the abortion referendum. I do not believe the Government expects to remain in office for very long after that referendum is held. The Bill before us is solely designed to boost the chances of that amendment on abortion being carried, by hook or by crook. It is the clearest sign yet that the Government knows it is in serious trouble of losing its abortion referendum.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a cop-out. Few people in this House are vocal supporters of the manner in which the referendum commission has operated since it came into existence. That is no reflection on the individuals who make up the commission, they have done their best in difficult circumstances. In particular, the commission has been placed in an invidious position on a number of occasions. It has had to devise and propagate reasons to retain the death penalty and to reject a proposal to acknowledge the role of local government in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Given the constraints imposed by the McKenna judgment, the referendum commission operated in a very restricted environment. Quite often its advertisements in the media resembled public procurement notices, hardly the type of presentation that grabs the attention of the public. The commission's ability to provoke debate or discussion is very questionable and I fully support reform in that regard. However, the Minister does not. The Minister and the Government support the stifling of debate. That is what this Bill achieves and that is why it will be opposed by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister has effectively ditched the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. He has ignored the contributions to the debate by, among others, Richard Sinnott and former Chief Justice O'Higgins in recent weeks. The referendum commission will now be confined to informing people that a poll is taking place and giving a brief outline of the proposal. The logic of the Minister's position is that the referendum commission should be abolished. Surely one of the legion of press officers employed by this Administration could turn its mind to informing the public of the date of a poll. Why do we need a commission to carry out this task?</P>
    <P>The Minister has singularly failed to take on board the key recommendation of the all-party committee, which was that State funding should be provided to both political parties and lobby groups for a referendum campaign. This solution overcomes the somewhat arid nature of the referendum commission's work and would provide for lively and <Col N="1436" /> energetic public debate on constitutional issues. The Minister has failed to introduce any proposals along these lines. The Government has walked away from its responsibilities to ensure that an informed electorate exercises its democratic franchise in constitutional matters. For a Minister allegedly concerned about falling voter turnout, this is an incredible turn of events.</P>
    <P>It proves yet again that this Minister's interest in electoral reform is pretty shallow. However, the Minister's effort to insulate the Government's abortion proposals from public debate and scrutiny may yet fall asunder. I have serious doubts about the legality of this proposal in the light of the McKenna judgment and believe that this legislation may well fall if tested in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the Referendum Commission to &ldquo;prepare one or more statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal .&rdquo;  I do not believe that a general explanation of the subject matter of an amendment to the Constitution can be value free. Any general explanation of the subject matter must contain some degree of advocacy. If anyone tries for a moment to construct a general explanation of the forthcoming referendum on abortion, for instance, the problems become apparent. Even the language used in a debate about abortion in this country is value laden. Does one refer to termination of pregnancy or abortion? Does one refer to the X case decision without referring to the real life tragedy that a 14 year old girl had to endure which is the real basis for that decision? </P>
    <P>The fact is that in some instances, and I believe the referendum on abortion is one of those instances, a general explanation cannot but be value laden. The very language used in such an explanation, and the language not used in that explanation, are conscious decisions that could be construed to implicitly advocate a vote either for or against the proposal.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when the proposals relating to the forthcoming abortion referendum were first published and explained by the Government very many people, including some interest groups who subsequently changed their minds, and including the writers of editorials of some newspapers who have probably changed their minds, initially came out in favour of the Government's proposals. The fact is that a general statement explaining what this referendum is about, without having with it the arguments for and against in this case, is tantamount to an argument in favour of the proposal. In terms of a general explanation on the abortion referendum explaining, for example, that this is to provide the constitutional response to the X case and Supreme Court decisions, it is very difficult to see how one can find in the English dictionary the kind of language which will not have within it some degree of value or opinion. The Government recognises this. That is why it is in such a mad rush to get this Bill through the House now so that it can have an entirely different kind of statement coming from the Referendum Commission than has <Col N="1437" /> been coming from it in relation to previous referenda.</P>

This is being brought in to tee off the abortion referendum. It will be tested in the courts before this Bill is signed into law or it will come before the Judiciary when the so-called general explanation is published. That section of the Bill is so loosely drafted that a variety of interpretations could be put on the term &ldquo;general explanation&rdquo; and I firmly believe it will be challenged in the courts.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will be opposing the Second Reading of this Bill for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>There is one thing on which I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who introduced this Bill, and that is that there is consensus that not all has been well with the conducting of referenda in the recent past. I do not agree, however, that the fault lies with the Referendum Commission or the rules by which it is bound. It is clear, and the public will see clearly, that the Government's argument that there is a need to quickly ratify the Nice Treaty is bogus. All the information coming from other parts of the European Union, from commentators outside Government, academic and otherwise, indicates that there is no rush. There are other countries that have yet to ratify the Nice Treaty. The public very quickly saw through the Government line. It was not the commission's line because the commission is bound only to give arguments which stand up factually, which can be substantiated and are true. Not only did the Government say there was a rush to ratify the Nice Treaty, it decided to give the minimum amount of time for one issue to be dealt with. It made this even more difficult and more suspect by trying to get four issues decided on the one day. Following protests from Opposition parties that was reduced to three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public is very astute at seeing what the Government is at when it puts its mind to casting a vote. Those who voted had a considerable amount more insight than the Government would like to give them credit for. It is small wonder therefore that the Referendum Commission had to rush out the information it was giving and that it therefore lacked detail and the slick presentation expected by media today. It is interesting <Col N="1438" /> and baffling that the Government has not picked up on why people are so suspicious when it tries to rush a measure through in the way it is trying to do again today.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Amsterdam treaty and going back to the Maastricht treaty which introduced the Single European Act, the Government either tried to rush in the legislation or to lump the referendum in with some other referendum. That makes it even more difficult for people to come to terms with all the minutiae of the detail that has to be considered. The Referendum Commission has had to amend or abandon plans to have live debates which would allow for live, vigorous, real and very highly charged debates between different protagonists from different sides.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is saying is that he does not believe in equal treatment. The commission is being sabotaged by not being able to carry out the role it was given. The Government claims that the commission's role is to put the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; sides of the debate, but the Government decides how much money the commission gets. If, as Deputy Lenihan claims, the need is for straightforward information, as was the case in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, it should not give the commission as much money. The Government still holds many of the cards. However, this Bill will be challenged. I believe the Government expects that the make-up of the courts will be different from when the McKenna judgment was handed down. It is taking the chance that, if challenged, it will be dragged along by the Government's claim that what was there before did not work. The Government has not allowed it to work, and the Government is trying to sabotage the Commission when it is the Government's fault that we have a problem with referenda.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time. This Bill is a disgrace and the manner in which it is being dealt with is also a disgrace. Today we are having a re-run of the fiasco of the anti-democratic waste management Bill which was rammed through the House on the last day of the last session so that the same Minister who is presenting this Bill, Deputy Dempsey, could remove decision making powers from elected members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Referendum Bill is a gross abuse of power by the Government. It is the rule of the bully &ndash; if your opponent defeats you fairly and by the rules, change the rules. The Government parties <Col N="1439" /> along with others, including Fine Gael and the Labour Party, were defeated in the Nice Treaty referendum. Rather than accept and act upon the decision of the electorate, the Government has tried to explain away that decision and has found a scapegoat in the Referendum Commission. That is what we are seeing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us recall the reason the Referendum Commission was established. Previously, the Government could use public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum campaign. It could buy all the advertising and publicity it needed without spending its party political funds. The Supreme Court judgment in the case taken by Patricia McKenna found that practice unconstitutional. The Referendum Commission was established and given the task of presenting the arguments on both sides in referenda.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the legislation establishing the Referendum Commission prevents political parties spending their own money on campaigns. To listen to some commentators, you would think only the commission could argue the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; cases. The reality is that in the Nice Treaty referendum campaign the parties on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side could not motivate or mobilise their activists and supporters. They lost the campaign, the argument and the referendum. Then they played the blame game and the losers are the people, whose access to full and comprehensive information is being curtailed by this emasculation of the Referendum Commission.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Commission was not given the opportunity to operate as intended. The Amsterdam Treaty referendum and the Good Friday Agreement referendum were held on the same day in 1998. This year there were three referenda on the same day dealing with the Nice Treaty, the abolition of the death penalty and the International Court of Justice and, as my colleague pointed out earlier, it was intended to have a fourth referendum. In the space of three weeks the commission was expected to put together advertising campaigns on these referenda. It was given an impossible task. To criticise the commission for its presentation and to accuse it of sowing confusion in such circumstances is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill has nothing to do with the operation of the Referendum Commission. It is about circumventing the McKenna judgment and fixing the outcome of the next referendum on the Nice Treaty. All the major parties will be united in support of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and will have access to increased State funding to fight their campaigns as a result of other legislation passed this year. If the outcome of the Nice Treaty referendum had been different, as I pointed out to the Taoiseach this week, this shameful Bill would not ever have seen the light of day. However, one cannot fool all the people all the time. Clearly, the electorate trusted the impartial Referendum Commission more than it trusted the unholy alliance on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side. Now it sees that side effectively abol<Col N="1440" /> ishing the Referendum Commission, at least the Government manifestation of it.</P>
    <P>I believe the people will make their judgment. I reject this Bill as a gross abuse of power and an attack on democracy.</P>

      <P>The only point on which I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin is that the people should decide the questions that are submitted to them in a plebiscite. I do not support the existence of a body which censors, amends or re-explains other people's arguments and purports to give them some form of authenticity. I thank the members of the all-party committee, representing Fine Gael and the Labour Party as well as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, who unanimously agreed on that one point.</P>
      <P>We cannot have a commission which recycles arguments and purports to give them a <i>nihil obstat</i>, described by Deputy Ó Caoláin as providing full and comprehensive information. The very stuff of political debate is partisanship. I disagree profoundly with what Deputy Ó Caoláin said about the Nice Treaty but that is something we must argue before the people, not feed arguments into an official commission in the middle of a referendum debate and have people confused with the idea that our arguments have official standing or sanction.</P>
      <P>The air in this Chamber has been thick with political charge and counter charge this afternoon. It is undoubtedly correct, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, that this Bill is required by the pending referendum but it is also clear that it is a modest Bill. It has one section. The all-party committee did not propose that money should automatically be given out in every referendum campaign. It recommended that consideration should be given to an equal distribution of funds to the partisans in a debate. It could never be required in every referendum that that be the case and, as the Minister said, there are many good and valid reasons that the Government saw such a scheme as extremely complex to put into operation. There are also many taxpayers who would object to public moneys being employed to put forward some of the points of view that are expressed in different plebiscites. It is obvious that many taxpayers would object to the funding of arguments with which they might have a profound disagreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Mr. de Valera brought forward the Constitution in 1937, there was no Government sponsored campaign to introduce the measure. The Fianna Fáil party had to campaign to have that document enacted. There was no question of State funds being used. I have always admired Patricia McKenna for instituting the proceedings which ensured that Governments could not use State finances to fund the outcome of a refer<Col N="1441" /> endum result. The Government that did that was the rainbow Government led by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>The Government has to look at how a proper debate can take place among the people in the pending referendum. Having a commission which recycles arguments is not a device to assist public understanding of the issues involved. A call was made by Deputy Shatter for the Bill to be referred by the President to the Supreme Court on the basis that a former Chief Justice believes the Supreme Court might change its mind on the McKenna decision. However, there is nothing in this Bill which infringes the McKenna decision in any respect and no constitutional provision was advanced by Deputy Shatter regarding why the President should consider there is a doubt about the constitutional validity of this measure. In fact, there is nothing in the Bill that infringes the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made the case that section 1(<i>a</i>) of the Bill might give rise to litigation in the course of a referendum campaign where the general statement which the commission will now prepare could give rise to controversy and court proceedings. However, that is not a ground for the unconstitutionality of the measure, it is simply an anticipation of what might happen during a referendum contest. If that happens, the courts will have to address and deal with it but there is nothing in the Bill which infringes the Constitution. There is no basis for the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court when there is nothing in the Bill which is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has acted on the recommendation of the all-party committee and I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>Parties under the rules of the House as we know them. That recommendation was made. We will definitely have two referendums, whenever they are held. It is incumbent on the Government to make decisions on these matters if it agrees that what obtains is unsatisfactory. The Oireachtas committee that considered the matter agrees it is unsatisfactory. Nearly all the contributions today by Deputies agreed that <Col N="1442" /> the current situation, where the for and against arguments must be made by the commission, is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. It was described as farcical and I agree &ndash; that is the opinion of most who have considered the matter. I do not know the exact date of the next referendum &ndash; the Taoiseach has indicated he would like to see it in February or March but it is incumbent on the Government to ensure this farcical situation does not obtain at that time and, therefore, to make changes which will affect the holding of that referendum and the role of the commission. It is a one-line Bill because the other sections are just standard. The changes are contained in one section. To say that this was rushed, and to imply the Government is trying to do something underhand, is wrong. All of this has been done in the open.</P>

      <P>The Government cannot be accused of rushing the matter without proper debate. The subject of referendums was considered and reported on in 1996 in the report of the review group on the Constitution. It was then referred to in the first progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in April 1997 and in the recent sixth progress report published last month. The matter was debated in both Houses when the Referendum Act, 1998, was approved, and also in a special Seanad motion in June 1999.</P>

      <P>That is what is emanating from that party. Deputy Shatter sought clarification of the general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal in section 1. If he looks up the 1998 Act that is being amended, he will see it contains the same statement in relation to the role of the commission in preparing a statement containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and of the text thereof in the relevant Bill. The commission will do its duty. It is competent and will act independently. I will not tell the commission how to perform its function. While there has been criticism of the statements with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; arguments, there has not been the same criticism of the commission's statements in fulfilling its duties under paragraph 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>I reject the statement by Deputy Gilmore that the Government was trying to stifle debate through this Bill. There is a general view that the production of a list of arguments for &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,&rdquo; without a weighting of those arguments, is leading to confusion on the part of voters. That has been confirmed in the different contributions to the House. It is also the view of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and is supported by leading political scientists. There is a difference between providing balanced information and information which is likely to confuse voters. The Referendum Commission will issue one or more statements setting out a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal. It will then be a matter for the Government, political parties, individual Members of the Oireachtas, interested groups and individuals to put forward their points of view. The electorate can have regard to the arguments for and against and will be able to form a view on the weight they should give to those arguments. This is considered to be more balanced than a straight list of arguments that does not give any indication as to who or what organisation is promoting the argument. This should lead to a more productive debate on the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referenda, as an exercise in direct democracy, are important and how we conduct them and inform the electorate about the proposals before <Col N="1444" /> them is crucial to their effectiveness. This is a short Bill which seeks to correct what is generally accepted to be a weakness in the current arrangements by removing the function of the Referendum Commission to present arguments for and against a proposal. However, it also seeks to develop its responsibilities by giving it a new remit as a promoter of participation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not about rowing back on the McKenna judgment as has been suggested by some speakers. That judgment is not a restraining factor on any party, Government or interest group engaging in robust campaigning at a referendum. It prevents, however, the use of Government funds to promote a result on one side of a referendum argument. This Bill respects that position fully.</P>
    <P>There should be no suggestion of a constitutional inquiry into the Bill. While the Bill implements two of the recommendations of the all-party Oireachtas committee report, it does not provide for a scheme to dispense funds among the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti&rdquo; sides at a referendum, as was recommended in that report. It is agreed by all sides that the introduction of such a scheme would require detailed examination of the statutory criteria, the allocation of funds, what conditions should be attached to that funding, and arrangements for the auditing of expenditure. Any scheme would have to be in compliance with the legal judgment to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned a question that he put to the Taoiseach on 6 December. On that date, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, indicated the matters were under consideration. The Taoiseach indicated the matter had been before the Government for some weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up on what was said on Second Stage, section 1 is to remove the option of presenting the arguments in a balanced way. It has been argued by Deputy Brian Lenihan that it is not good to have arguments recycled, as he put it. It is not simply that I am in favour of recycling that I disagree with him. The commission exists to ensure that there should be no bogus arguments and in that regard I certainly concur with the Deputy. However, if there was no referendum commission ensuring that arguments for and against could be stood over, then there would be a danger not just of Government parties, but of groups from a wide section of society, arguing over their views of the matter without necessarily having them corroborated by an independent body such as the referendum commission. It is important we avoid that.</P>
      <P>I realise there were bogus arguments on both sides in recent referenda and the commission is there to provide a means of validating arguments. It should be helped and supported in doing so. We had arguments put out by those supporting the Nice Treaty which stated there would be no enlargement without that treaty, which had to be in place to allow enlargement to happen. We now realise that the situation is far more complex. Under the Amsterdam Treaty there was provision for further enlargement. There were other arguments that at the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference, when the new countries have become members, they can be part of the decision-making which would influence their futures within the EU.</P>
      <P>We need the opportunity to put the arguments for and against which the commission could validate. That role should be protected and accordingly I must oppose the section. The Maastricht Treaty was about the Single Market and introducing the euro, which is now around the corner, but there were arguments that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on Maastricht would be a vote against women. How can anybody stand over arguments if there is no referendum commission to validate both sides and to make sure those arguments are articulated?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan said people would resent their money being spent in a way that gives credence to a minority view. As I said, if the case is strong enough it should withstand whatever derisory argument is made against it. It should not be banned from being made by the commission simply because it is a minority view.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his admiration of Patricia McKenna, which I share. I am sure she will be delighted to hear that.</P>
      <P>I agree there is a need for real debate. The commission was anxious to organise a live debate from which footage could have been added to the political debate in a way that is validated. The Minister of State would not like to dismiss that as recycling arguments. It would be the proper way for the commission to help motivate people to make decisions and vote in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what money political parties are able to spend must be answered. If we pass <Col N="1448" /> this Bill, though I hope we do not, we will depend more on parties to spend their own money. Due to suspicion of corporate funding, much of that funding comes from State coffers. We need clear demarcation regarding groups which are non-Government organisations and umbrella groups outside the political parties not being disadvantaged in that case. However, I suspect there is an underlying expectation that there will be more money available to, for example, the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side in the Nice Treaty debate as a result of the Bill. That goes against the spirit of the McKenna judgment, whatever about the letter of the law and the constitutionality of the judgment. We are in a very suspicious area which has to be clarified if we are not to alienate the public further from the Government, which is likely.</P>

      <P>There are six Members offering and we are due to conclude at 3.17 p.m. so if the House is agreeable, we will divide the remaining time between those speakers. They will get four and a half to five minutes each. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State can understand the basis of the criticisms all speakers have levelled at the method of introduction of this Bill. There is less than two hours debate on the last day of the session, when many Members have already returned to their constituencies without knowing the Bill is going through the House. We are primarily opposed to the content of the Bill, however. The Minister of State criticised us for saying that we understood the difficulties surrounding the pro and anti arguments and wondered why we would not vote for the Bill, as it had been agreed at the all-party committee. The reality is that the Minister and the Government cherry-picked from the recommendations of the committee. They have moved to reduce the level of public information available in the context of a referendum and I suspect it is only in the context of one referendum in particular that this is being pushed through so rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 removes the requirement to put both sides of an argument, which will cause all sorts of problems. That method, warts and all, was one way of communicating concerns of the public. Section 1 goes further and removes the right of approved bodies to make submissions to the commission. It seems that the Minister is arguing that one should follow the other. The reality is that there is no reason why removing the requirement to put both arguments should be accompanied by the removal of the power of approved bodies to make submissions. At least these submissions would provide the public with information about concerns on one side or the other. This is a diminution of democracy as it provides less information, not more. It may also provide very limited information, so we are giving a conundrum to the commission and asking them, in one or more statements, to give the subject matter of the proposal and the text thereof. It defies imagination <Col N="1449" /> to begin to think how they are to do so in the context of the abortion referendum, which will probably be the next referendum. It will do nothing to add to the sum of knowledge regarding what is involved in this referendum when there is not even agreement in the House about the interpretation of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State not agree that in trying to facilitate the easy passage of the abortion referendum, he is imperilling it and it is almost certainly going to be subject to a constitutional challenge? That challenge will probably come in the middle of the campaign. It is totally counterproductive to push the Bill through in this way and to cherry-pick from the recommendations, picking one and not replacing the power to give information which existed, however problematic, with any other method of giving information to the public.</P>

      <P>Of necessity, the Committee Stage debate is like that on Second Stage because the Bill has only one section of substance and we are re-arguing the points already discussed on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>When I was a child, the literature of the Roman Catholic tradition contained an item called the <i>Nihil Obstat</i>, which confirmed that the material in a book, while not necessarily true, was free from error.</P>
      <P>That, essentially, is what the Referendum Commission purports to do. It is an unelected body responsible to nobody, and although it is formally independent, it is hard to know if one can be independent on questions where political passions are evident. Arguments are given authenticity in the minds of people if they are recited by a public body. I welcome the fact that a number of speakers on the Opposition benches accepted that an authority with such a function should not exist, which is something I believe as a liberal and a democrat.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell claimed that the Government is cherry-picking from the recommendations of the all-party committee, but two recommendations are to be implemented. As well as the recommendation we have been discussing, the Government has agreed to charge the Referendum Commission with promoting public awareness of referenda and encouraging people to vote, which is an important function and one which the commission can usefully perform. The commission will not be judging what people's opinions should be when voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in Deputy Sargent's point about how we should fund future referenda, which is an important issue. The all-party committee acknowledged that there is a case for examining whether funds should be distributed equally to the proponents and opponents of a proposal, in accordance with the McKenna judgment. Had such a provision been in place in 1998, however, I do not believe taxpayers would have welcomed the distribution of money to the <Col N="1450" /> DUP and the associates of the Real IRA for the purposes of campaigning against the Good Friday Agreement. I would not like to anticipate the arguments that will be made if a referendum is held as a result of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, which was recently passed. There have been enormous controversies in the United States in relation to abortion and the provision of taxpayers' money and similar arguments will arise here if the Referendum Commission decides to distribute money to those arguing in favour of abortion.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sargent that a clear distinction will have to be made between the distribution of public moneys to political parties for administration and research and distribution for the purposes of campaigning. There is an onus on political parties to raise funds for campaigns from interested parties who believe passionately in particular causes. The Deputy referred to the arguments during the referendum on the Treaty of Nice about whether the treaty was essential for enlargement. The best evidence available to us suggests that ten countries will seek admission next year, so we will have to ratify the treaty to facilitate this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Sargent's argument that there should be a body to validate arguments in advance of a referendum. To charge an official body with deciding whether or not a certain argument should be accepted would bring the idea of &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; to its ultimate extreme. I believe in freedom of speech, a principle which should apply to the conduct of referenda. We need to address how we resource the promotion of views on propositions being put to the people, so that all sides have an equal opportunity to put arguments forward. We would be going down the road of censorship if we were to create a body to decide whether a certain argument was valid or correct. Such official supervision of the conduct of political debate is unwise.</P>
      <P>Although the all-party committee's examination of how referenda should be conducted was thorough, the Government has not accepted it. If the recommendation that Dáil debates on referenda propositions should not be guillotined had been accepted, we would not have had to endure the curtailment of the debate on the abortion referendum Bill. The Government has accepted a recommendation by the all-party committee out of its context in order to conduct the abortion referendum in a particular manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Committee Stage is to examine in detail the text of a Bill, so I want to draw attention to a function of the Referendum Commission which is to be withdrawn. Section 3(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Referendum Act, 1998, says that the Referendum Commission's mandate shall be &ldquo;to foster and promote and, where appropriate, to facilitate debate or discussion in a manner that is fair to all interests concerned in relation to the proposal aforesaid&rdquo;. The Referendum Bill, 2001, removes <Col N="1451" /> the arrangement whereby submissions in favour of and against a proposal are received from various bodies and individuals and circulated in advertisements. The commission's remaining function will be to make a general statement on the proposition. This change could have been done by repealing section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 1998 Act, but all of section 3(1) is being replaced instead. The commission's current function, to foster, promote and facilitate fair debate, is to be removed and its only function will be to issue a general statement, which cannot be free from opinion or value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss section 1, which amends the 1998 Act. I agree with Deputy Gilmore's comments on the proposal that the commission should &ldquo;prepare one or more statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and of the text thereof&rdquo;. The Minister has not responded to my challenge on Second Stage to explain how he envisages the commission will be able to perform the task in the context of the abortion referendum, which has obviously acted as the catalyst for the introduction of this legislation and the bludgeoning of it through the House today. How will the commission be able to give a general explanation of the text? Will it receive advice from the Bar library or, in the case of the abortion referendum, from the Medical Council? Will philosophers and the leaders of the churches be consulted? How many explanations will be given? Will a statement be issued, saying that a certain number of people believe the proposal means one thing and other people think it means something else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say the Bill replicates the provisions of the 1998 Act, which taken as a whole created the artificial situation whereby equal weight is given to arguments of little validity. I have already expressed my views on that. There is an attempt to introduce via the back door a situation where the commission will have to make statements which the Government will hope will correspond with its interpretation of the relevant measure and no opportunity will be given for the expression of another view. If I understand the proposal correctly, that the Government has seconded to a commission a power the Supreme Court has said it cannot exercise, I envisage another legal challenge similar to that which led to the McKenna judgment. Given that the members of the Referendum Commission are independent of Government and are of great integrity, they are unlikely to do so. How is the statement to be put together in the case of a complex proposal? Should we have a rerun of the Treaty of Nice, what sort of statement would be put together explaining the text? Will it comprise many pages written in arcane, complex, technical language just to ensure that nothing in it is accurate? People will be expected to read such material, but only <Col N="1452" /> insomniacs will have the capacity to do so. It could be a cure for insomnia.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said it is unfair for us to refer to the abortion Bill in the context of this provision. However, this Bill is designed to deal with the forthcoming referendum on abortion. Will the Minister of State put on the record of the House the form of wording which he anticipates the commission may use? If he tells us he does not know, then why is he bringing a provision before the House, the application of which he does not understand?</P>
    <P>The complexities of constitutional provisions in this area, the proliferation of court cases, the likelihood that the Bill will be the subject of a constitutional challenge during a referendum and the general uncertainty surrounding the way in which it will work in practice requires, in the public interest, the President to refer the measure to the Supreme Court for adjudication under Article 26. It is important she does so to bring a degree of certainty to bear on a fundamental aspect of our law, namely, the rules applicable to the conduct of referenda. I hope this will occur. If such a course of action delays the date of the referendum planned by the Government, then so be it. In the meantime it may give the Progressive Democrats time to work out, in the odd manner in which they are trying to do, whether there is some ethereal consensus which they can detect or whether people are just being unwise and blundering into a referendum which, with more thought and less political expediency, would not be taking place in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this legislation. I strongly object to the manner in which it is being brought before the House on the last day of the session with less than two hours debate. We only saw the Bill three days ago and the Taoiseach was not able to state whether there was going to be any change. This Bill is fundamentally undemocratic and its effect is to deny the electorate full information regarding future referenda. Does the Minister of State agree the Bill would never have seen the light of day if the electorate had not given the political parties and the establishment a bloody nose by voting against the Treaty of Nice?</P>
      <P>This Bill prevents public moneys being used to give citizens fair and easy access to both sides of the argument in future referenda. It is an attack on the right to information. It is further evidence of the Government's contempt for the people and the fact it did not respect the people's view as expressed in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent asked what funds can be spent by political parties in promoting their points of view in future referenda. Political parties will not be able to use funds allocated to them out of the public purse, such as the parliamentary leaders' allowance. Under existing legislation <Col N="1453" /> there is no limit on expenditure by bodies or individuals in a referendum campaign. The McKenna judgment held that while the Government may advocate a result in a referendum, it could not use public funds to do so to the detriment of the opposing side.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Commission may incur expenditure of such moneys advanced to it as determined by the Minister who initiates the relevant Bill containing the proposal. The point made in the McKenna judgment was not that either or both sides were spending too much on the campaign, but that the use by the Government of public funds to finance a campaign to influence voters in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to the detriment of those opposed to the constitutional amendment was not permissible. The Bill does not propose to allocate public funds to groups campaigning on either side.</P>
      <P>There are legal implications to limiting expenditure at a referendum which could result in a limitation on the debate in which interest groups are an integral part and there could be constitutional issues concerning freedom of speech. It could also run the risk of a petition being taken against the result of a referendum on the grounds that it was an interference with the conduct of the referendum.</P>
      <P>In its judgment on the appeal against the decision of the High Court on the Hanafin petition, the Supreme Court held that interference, as defined in the Referendum Act relating to the conduct of a referendum, has a broader meaning than interference with mechanical arrangements by local returning officers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised the issue of the removal of the ability of groups to make submissions to the commission. This is not the case. Section 1(<i>b</i>) repeals section 6 of the Referendum Act, 1998, which provides that a person may make submissions in writing or by electronic mail to the commission regarding the proposed subject of a referendum. This section is directly linked to the function of preparing a statement or arguments for and against the referendum proposal in the existing section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and it will not be required. It is open to anyone to communicate with the Referendum Commission. Therefore, it is not necessary to stipulate this matter in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, which was enacted in July last and which provided for a significant restructuring of the way the horseracing industry is organised and funded. The Act provided, among other things, for the establishment of a new body &ndash; Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to replace the Irish Horseracing Authority and to take over certain functions from the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
      <P>Since the legislation was passed it has been widely welcomed across all sectors of the industry. There is recognition that the new and unified structure and the security of the substantial funding that the Act gives to Irish racing will position it well for the future. However, one problem has arisen in relation to the detailed provisions of paragraph 16 of the schedule to the Act relating to the composition of the board of HRI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, the Racing Regulatory Body <Col N="1455" /> has five seats on the board of Horse Racing Ireland and the racecourses, racehorse owners, trainers, breeders, bookmakers, employees and the sector in Northern Ireland have one seat each. This composition was decided on to reflect fair representation for all major sectors in the industry which depend on horseracing for their livelihoods. The substantive change in the structure of and funding for Irish racing in the Act is to give the industry direct responsibility to guide and promote the development of its own business.</P>
    <P>While under the Act I have arranged for broad ranging representation on a sectoral basis my vision is for a cohesive board rising above all sectoral interests and operating exclusively for the common good and the long-term interest of the whole industry.</P>
    <P>I have already appointed an interim board to Horse Racing Ireland. The board has applied itself with enthusiasm to carrying out the work that needs to be completed before the formal establishment of HRI including the selection and appointment of a chief executive for the new body. I intend to formalise the establishment of HRI under an establishment day order as soon as all the necessary preparatory work has been completed.</P>
    <P>A very strong case was made to me before, during and since the enactment of the legislation that, to achieve the objective of giving the industry control over its own business, the people appointed to the board should, as far as possible, be those engaged at the coal face of the industry. For this reason when it came to appointing the employees' representative, I was anxious to provide an opportunity for representation for those who work directly with horses and who make a major contribution to the sector.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has been the nominating body for the representative of persons employed in the horseracing industry on the board of the Irish Horseracing Authority since its establishment in 1994 and I acknowledge that their nominee has served the industry very well over the years. However, I was anxious this time, especially in light of widespread representations made to me, to give an opportunity to the other employees who are not affiliated to that organisation to serve on the board. After some informal consultation with the industry and taking account of the objectives of the legislation, I decided on this occasion to appoint a representative from the Stable Staffs Association. The stable staff are among the lowest paid employees in the sector and often work in difficult conditions. They had not previously been represented on any of the decision making fora in Irish racing and given their important and essential, although often forgotten, role in this business, I believed the time was right to give them such representation now.</P>
    <P>I have since received strong representations from ICTU, MANDATE and SIPTU that a <Col N="1456" /> nominee of theirs should have been appointed to represent the persons employed in the industry on the basis that they represent the majority of employees in the sector. They have indicated that they are prepared to take legal action in pursuit of their case on this issue.</P>
    <P>It was not ever my intention to overlook the employees represented by those two unions and ICTU. The appointment of the representative of the Stable Staffs Association to the board of HRI was not considered to be a permanent arrangement. The Act, in paragraph 16 of the schedule, provides for rotation of board members. From the outset, three members will retire each year. The legislation does not require me to regard the same persons or organisations to be representative of the various industry interests and to be the nominating bodies on each occasion on which I have to make an appointment. It was my intention that when the person to represent the employees in the industry came to be re-nominated this would be done in consultation with ICTU. Other employee groups who are not members of unions affiliated to ICTU but, nonetheless, do important jobs in the industry should be given reasonable opportunity to be represented on HRI from time to time.</P>
    <P>The case made by the unions for immediate representation on the board of HRI is compelling. MANDATE and SIPTU represent many administrative, technical, official and professional staff directly employed in the horseracing industry. Their work is fundamental to the success that Irish racing has achieved in recent years. I pay tribute again to their representative on the IHA who has served with dedication and has made a tremendous contribution to the work of the board. In consideration of this, and as a reflection of the value this Government places on partnership with unions, I wish to accede to their request.</P>
    <P>I remain strongly of the view that there should be a place on the board for key people like the stable staff. They make a unique contribution to the horseracing industry. We entrust them with our highly valuable racehorses, and in those circumstances, we should give them a well deserved say in the future of Irish racing. I am satisfied the sector will be better off for it.</P>
    <P>To resolve this problem, I propose to regard ICTU as the nominating body for the persons employed in the industry. I propose to amend the 2001 Act by increasing the number of board members by one. This will allow a representative of those employed directly in the horseracing industry &ndash; on this occasion the Stable Staffs Association &ndash; to be appointed to the board also and I propose that this should be done by direct ministerial appointment.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to make one or two other minor technical changes. As it stands, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, provides for the appointment of a board consisting of a chairman and 12 ordinary members.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House essentially proposes to amend the Horse and Greyhound Rac<Col N="1457" /> ing Act, 2001, so as to increase the number of ordinary members of the board of Horse Racing Ireland from 12 to 13 with the additional member to be appointed by the Minister. There are some other minor technical amendments.</P>
    <P>As the establishment day order for HRI has not yet been made, it is necessary to give effect to these changes, to replace paragraph 16 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, in its entirety. That paragraph contained all the amendments in the 2001 Act to the original schedule of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994. This Bill proposes to re-state those amendments with provision this time for an extra board member and some further associated changes. However, most of the provisions of the schedule to the 1994 Act as amended by paragraph 16 of the 2001 Act remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Following are the provisions of the Bill; section 1 (1) (<i>a</i>) increases the number of ordinary members of HRI from 12 to 13.</P>
    <P>The main changes consequential on the increase in board membership which this Bill proposes are contained in subparagraphs (1) (<i>c</i>) (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of a new paragraph 7 for the 1994 schedule to be inserted by section 1 (1) (<i>b</i>) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) (<i>c</i>) of the new paragraph 7 removes the nomination of the union's representative from the requirement that such nominee had to be elected in similar fashion to the other industry interests. The new provision will allow a nominee to be selected using a consultative process within ICTU involving all of the unions, with employees in this sector, affiliated to the congress rather than an electoral one.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) (<i>d</i>) of the new paragraph 7 provides for the direct appointment by the Minister of one person from persons employed directly in the horseracing industry, thereby allowing employees such as stable staff, who play a key role in the industry, to be represented on HRI.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) (<i>e</i>) of the new paragraph 7 also removes the nomination of the representative of horseracing in Northern Ireland from the election requirement as such an election process may not be conveniently feasible and provides that such member of HRI will be appointed directly by the Minister after consultation with horseracing interests in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (<i>c</i>) sets out the terms of office of the chairman and the ordinary members of HRI and the rotation arrangements all of which remain unchanged from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (<i>d</i>) concerns a technicality relating to filling a vacancy on the board of HRI and is unchanged from the provision in the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001. Section 1(2) repeals paragraph 16 of the schedule to the Act of 2001. Section 1(3) provides that subsection (1) shall come into operation on the same establishment day as provided for in the 2001 Act so that the provisions of that Act relating to the estab<Col N="1458" /> lishment of HRI and this Bill will come into effect at the same time.</P>
    <P>Section 1(4) provides a definition. Section 2 provides a short title for this Bill when enacted. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Barrett. This Bill is an admission of incompetence on the part of the Minister. The Bill went through this House and a select committee last May and it was enacted last June.</P>
      <P>On the final day of the session before Christmas, the Minister is making a commencement order and a change in the composition of the board. This is another admission of incompetence because he got it wrong the first time around. The Minister has put himself in a position where ICTU and two trade unions appear to be contemplating legal action to vindicate their right to nominate members to the board. The Minister should not have allowed himself to be put in that position and this is an indication of incompetence in the original Bill. It is not as if the Minister was not asked on many occasions to think again about what he was doing.</P>
      <P>Without the slightest disrespect to any members of the current board, it is a dangerous thing to appoint people to State boards on the basis of private recommendations made by colleagues. When one operates in that kind of informal way one can get into trouble. That is why the Minister is coming into the House today with egg on his face. I understand the position of ICTU and the two unions, given the history of representation and the work of the union representatives on previous boards.</P>
      <P>A group of people in the industry appears to have found itself outside the range of interest of the unions. There is also perhaps a group which was not especially enamoured at being represented by the unions. That situation has been remedied by the Minister in a way which has created the problem we have today. We should not find ourselves in this position nor should we be here in the last hour of the last day of this session putting through all Stages of a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to make one change and some minor technical amendments to the main Act. If we reach Committee Stage in this deplorable procedure I intend to propose another change, that in addition to having a trade union representative on the board &ndash; I do not oppose the Minster's amendment in that regard &ndash; provision should be made for a representative of racegoers to be included. I made this proposal on Committee Stage of the original Bill but the Minister, rather uncomfortably, refused to agree. I am not sure if he believes in fairies but he appears to believe in magic arts because he told me on Second and Committee Stages of the original Bill that it would not be possible to get a person who would properly represent racegoers. Yet, he apparently has no difficulty in deciding on the nomination of bodies to represent racegoers in a <Col N="1459" /> consultative forum. It is apparently possible in the Minister's world to have racegoers in a forum but not on the board of the company. Frankly, I do not believe a word he says. It is not that he cannot do this or that it is impossible, simply that the Minister will not do it. I wonder why.</P>
    <P>With his usual geniality and deflection of attention from the main issues, the Minister solemnly informed me on Second and Committee Stages that a racegoers' representative on the board was not necessary because most board members would be punters. That is disingenuous. The other members of the board have other legitimate interests to represent and are not there as punters. While they may be punters &ndash; some of them enthusiastically so &ndash; they represent other interests, as set out in the main Act.</P>
    <P>It is a deficiency that there is not a representative of racegoers <i>qua </i>racegoers on the board for reasons of which the Minister is well aware. The business would not exist without racegoers. None of the panoply, the show, the excitement and the interest we all see and enjoy would exist if large numbers of people were not prepared to go to the races. There would be no prestigious races and none of the excitement of the big races or the camaraderie of the small ones if people were not prepared to go to the races on Saturdays and now, thank God, on Sundays and other days of the week. Racegoers are the lifeblood of the industry.</P>
    <P>Any board of the kind of authority under consideration here on which racegoers are not represented is incomplete. It is idle to say, as the Minister undoubtedly will, that all or the vast majority of board members are punters. I do not know if that is the case. There may also be some board members who know the industry too well to punt. Whatever the position, they are not there to represent the interests of racegoers. A board of this kind would be significantly strengthened by having on it a person whose mandate it is to represent the interests of racegoers.</P>
    <P>The Minister will rightly say that in recent years many racetracks have made substantial improvements in the standard of facilities available to racegoers. That can be said about the Curragh, next door to my home, Naas, Punchestown, Cork &ndash; I nearly said Mallow &ndash; and many other racecourses around the country. Very desirable improvements have been made in all of these cases, albeit a few years later than they should have. I am sure the Minister would agree. Had there been a strong, dedicated voice for racegoers in the right councils at the time there would have been better representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and one or two of his Cabinet colleagues are assiduous racegoers. However, they do not have to jostle at the bar to get their drinks or in the restaurant to get a sandwich or plate of smoked salmon. It is handed to them and they should enjoy that privilege. In view of this, the board would be immeasurably improved by hav<Col N="1460" /> ing among its membership a dedicated representative of racegoers.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the other proposed changes but it would be a fitting end to what has been a trying year for the Minister if he were to accept my amendment. I urge him to do so in the limited time between now and Committee Stage, provided for under the appalling procedure to which he has agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Dukes on the question of representation. Where boards comprise members representing groups there is always a danger that they will be obliged to consider how decisions will affect the group and not the overall situation. A trade union representative will look after the members associated with the industry. Equally, a representative with an independent mind who can speak on behalf of the racegoers should be on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline the proposals on the tracks owned by Horse Racing Ireland, such as those at Leopardstown, Navan and so on. The track at Leopardstown, a course of international repute and a major tourism attraction, is the only remaining track in Dublin and caters for 1.5 million people. Unfortunately, some bright people have decided that, after 120 years of racing at Leopardstown, a motorway is to be put through the race track. I find this absolutely extraordinary. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, can confirm, when the line of the proposed motorway first came before Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the engineers said this was the least preferred option. However, what was then the least preferred option, namely the line through the race track, is now the line being used and nobody seems to know how this came about. In addition to damaging the track itself and its whole environment, the proposed road will also destroy the golfing facility which had been developed in the centre of the track which has produced substantial revenue to improve the race track facilities. The golf course has been a major facility for thousands of people, particularly for women taking up golf. It is extraordinary, when we are trying to increase prize money &ndash; I welcome the latest increase of £750,000 &ndash; that such a valuable asset as Leopardstown Racecourse should be destroyed. I do not know what influence the Minister may have in the matter at this late stage to stop this nonsense. If this was a listed building, a Georgian building that had been in existence for 120 years, there would be an outcry <Col N="1461" /> if the local authority allowed a brick to be changed. However, it seems that a race track that has been in existence for 120 years can be destroyed and nobody says a word about it. I did not see any objections from An Taisce or other bodies about this, apart from some public representatives, including Deputy Gilmore and myself. We seem to be up against a stone wall on the issue.</P>
    <P>As part of this Bill, there should be a board of directors, properly constituted, for each of the tracks owned by the State. It should also provide for representation from the area concerned and people who would ensure this kind of nonsense would not be allowed to happen. No matter what compensation is given &ndash; even £50 million &ndash; for the loss of the facility in Leopardstown, it can never be recreated. God only knows what damage will be done to the drainage system of the area during the construction of the road. It is unclear what will be done in relation to car parking. None of those issues has been openly debated.</P>
    <P>In terms of the structures and management of the racing industry, we should ensure our tracks are protected and that the Minister's Department and other Departments with an interest in the matter are quick to lodge objections against any unsuitable proposal. I am in favour of building a proper road network and it would be a different matter if there was only one route available for the particular motorway to which I have referred. However, it is inexplicable that the option now selected is the one which the engineers described ten years ago as the least preferred. Apart from the loss of revenue from the golf course, the loss of that facility affects a great number of people, including possibly as many as 1,000 women who have their own golfing societies based there. It is a public facility, on a pay-as-you-play basis, introducing people to a sport and generating great revenue for ongoing improvements to the track. I do not know where future funding will be found for the continuous investment needed to keep facilities up to standard. Will it come from the punters or the State coffers, simply because a motorway is to go through the race track? The local authority, if my information is correct, had to pay £32 million in compensation to replace a plot of land that had been designated for housing. That is absolute madness.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in his reply to the debate, to outline his proposals in relation to the management structure of the tracks, particularly those owned by the State and, if it is possible at this late stage, to intervene in the Leopardstown case with a view to having the proposed motorway follow one of the alternative routes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak <Col N="1462" /> on this Bill. Clearly, the Bill is now before the House because there was an error of judgment in its initial stages of preparation earlier this year. I welcome the provision of a place for representatives of employees of the racing industry on the board. The workers are a vital part of the industry, including those in the stables, racecourses, the tote and the many other facilities involved. They will have two representatives on the board. The organisations represented on the board will include the authorised racecourses, racehorse owners, trainers, breeders and bookmakers. The missing link, as Deputy Dukes said, is representation of the punters, the race-going public. I regret that the Minister did not complete the circle in that regard. Satisfied punters are essential to the success of the entire industry and to its future development. Indeed, they are the most important part of the entire operation. I ask the Minister to consider the amendment put forward by Deputy Dukes in that respect. Major racing festivals are developing at an almost incredible rate in this country, such as those at Galway, Tralee, Killarney and Listowel. However, the more local events during the winter months are not so well supported and have not got the resources to provide for increased prize money to make the ordinary one day meetings a success. In such circumstances, it is difficult for racecourses to have a profitable tote or to offer a jackpot or place prize of any significance.</P>
      <P>It is vital that punters should be represented on the board of Horse Racing Ireland. As previous speakers stated, those who are already members of the board are interested in promoting the particular areas they represent. We are not facilitating the most important people of all, however, namely paying customers. I recently met a person who cares for a number of senior citizens at a certain hospital and who decided to bring 25 of them, many in wheelchairs, on an outing to a race meeting. When they arrived, they discovered that the price of admission for OAPs was only £1 less than the normal price. That is unbelievable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the many racetracks in County Kildare which have been magnificently developed in recent years. It is great to see successful race meetings being held at Punchestown which experienced many difficulties in the past. In the overall context of trying to increase the numbers attending race meetings, surely a larger concession than £1 per head off the price of admission could be offered to OAPs and to sizeable groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stable Staffs Association is delighted by the fact that it will be represented on the board. This move was initiated in County Kildare, in which the largest number of stables in the country are located. The representative of the association will be a welcome addition to the board. I hope the Minister, through his contacts in the Cabinet, will ensure that the association is given recognition by the ICTU to which it has made an application. It is only right that the ICTU should <Col N="1463" /> recognise the association because it represents many others like it. The Stable Staffs Association would benefit from guidance from the other unions that come under the ICTU umbrella. The members of the association, who, as the Minister stated, are among the lowest paid in the sector, would greatly appreciate it if it was recognised by the ICTU.</P>
    <P>I hope that membership of the board of Horse Racing Ireland will give the members of the Stable Staffs Association a new platform and will lead to an improvement in their working conditions. The number of racetracks which do not have adequate facilities for these people is too large and a further initiative must be taken in respect of providing proper facilities for the staff who look after horses on race days. A number of these people are expected to stay overnight on racecourses to look after the animals in the run up to some of the major racing festivals.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give further consideration to appointing a representative of racegoers to the board. I am aware that he is a punter himself and I have seen him at many race meetings. Deputies McGahon and Wright are also keen racegoers. In that context, perhaps the Minister could choose a Member of the House as the racegoers' representative. Deputy Barrett would be an ideal choice in that regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for sharing time with me. I join Deputy Barrett in drawing the Minister's attention to what is happening at Leopardstown racecourse. It beggars belief that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government decided to run a motorway through one of the country's premier&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is relevant because this Bill is aimed at amending the membership of the Irish Horseracing Authority which owns Leopardstown racecourse. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government decided to run a motorway through the racecourse and did so despite the fact that there was an alternative route available through the county council's dump. That route was originally selected by the county council in the period 1992 to 1993. A num<Col N="1464" /> ber of public representatives, including Deputy Barrett and myself, fought the attempt to run the motorway through the racecourse. It is remarkable, as the Deputy stated, that there has not been the kind of public hue and cry one would normally expect about a decision of this nature.</P>
      <P>I recall attending the public inquiry into the building of this motorway and I argued that it should not be run through the racecourse. To my amazement, representatives of the Irish Horseracing Authority, which had originally objected to the motorway being run through Leopardstown racecourse, appeared before the inquiry and withdrew its objection. This was done, apparently, on the basis of a deal worked out with the local authority for a land swap. As Deputy Barrett stated earlier, that land swap has resulted in the local authority having to spend more than £30 million to purchase replacement land for its housing programme. It has also resulted in a requirement that the racecourse must be redesigned. The redesigning of the racecourse will result in the existing 18 hole golf facility located there being reduced to a nine hole facility.</P>
      <P>The golf facility at the racecourse is used by 30 golfing societies. Those societies have 2,500 members, most of whom are women for whom golf is their main means of recreation. These people will be deprived of this recreational facility if the racecourse is redesigned in the manner outlined. I attempted to question the Minister about this issue last week during Question Time but was informed that it is a matter for the Irish Horseracing Authority. I and other public representatives have written to the chief executive of the authority asking him to meet with us but he declined to do so and stated that it is a matter for the management at the racecourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to intervene in this matter. He must direct the management at the racecourse and the Irish Horseracing Authority to redesign the racecourse in a way that accommodates the members of the golfing societies to which I refer and ensures that the 18 hole golf course remains in place. If the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can conclude an agreement with the Irish Farmers Association for compensation to be paid to farmers over whose land motorways are being built, he must also ensure that the golf facility at Leopardstown is not lost. If he does not &ndash; I do not say this as a political threat &ndash; various Ministers of State &ndash; I refer here to Deputies Seamus Brennan, Tom Kitt, O'Donnell, Eoin Ryan and Hanafin &ndash; and Deputy Andrews will find that this is the biggest issue with which they will be obliged to deal in the forthcoming general election campaign. I do not want to diminish the anger felt by the people who will be affected by this decision. It is a major issue which should be addressed as a matter of urgency. I ask the Minister to call in the chairman and the chief executive of the Horse Racing Authority and direct them to redesign the racecourse in a way which <Col N="1465" /> will involve no loss of public amenity or facility to the people concerned. It is bad enough that the decision was made in the first place to put a motorway through one of the country's premier racecourses without also completely discommoding the people who use the ancillary recreational facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it amazing, following the closure some years ago of Baldoyle Racecourse and of the Phoenix Park Racecourse, one of the finest tracks in Europe, leaving Dublin totally dependent on one metropolitan course, that this barbaric act should have been embarked on. The desecration of the sprint course at Leopardstown is inexcusable. I join my colleagues, particularly Deputy Gilmore, in asking the Minister to stop it. He has the power to do so in circumstances where the Taoiseach could commit £50 million to the GAA which already has quite adequate resources and turn a blind eye to the desecration of Leopardstown Racecourse, a track of which we can all be proud and which compares favourably with any track of which I am aware in the British Isles. It is inexcusable, particularly since, as Deputies Barrett and Gilmore have said, there was an alternative favoured by county council engineers. I find it inexplicable that any Government should allow that to happen. I shed no tears for lady golfers &ndash; we might be safer from misguided shots if some of them were up the Dublin mountains. I am concerned about the punters and the preservation of the lovely racetrack at Leopardstown, the only metropolitan track left in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Bacon's seat on this body should be given to the Racegoers Club of Ireland. Mention of the Racegoers Club brings to mind one man and that is Kevin Smyth who has done tremendous work for the Racegoers Club and for Irish racing in a very unassuming manner. He does not seek the limelight. If given a seat he would bring a great deal of knowledge of the horse racing industry and, if I may use a pun, a great deal of horse sense and common sense to this body.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we sometimes under value the horse racing industry. It employs 14,000 people, more than the Garda Síochána or the Army. It makes a tremendous contribution to our export market. In English racing, particularly national hunt racing, virtually every jockey of any consequence is Irish. It is a wonderful industry for us. It is one of the industries associated internationally with Ireland. I congratulate the racing authorities on the great increase in prize money there has been in recent times, which contrasts quite starkly with the very small amounts of money available in English racing today. That has encouraged many owners to stay in Ireland. While I, as the owner of the leg of a horse, have not as yet got any of that loot I hope to in the forthcoming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate my support for my colleagues. It is preposterous that the lovely track at Leopardstown, so pleasant on a summer's evening or at any time of the year, could be desecrated, that it <Col N="1466" /> could actually be torn up and lost to Irish racegoers. I ask the Minister not to let it happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extra prize money that has been put into the industry in recent years, from the great capital expenditure on our racecourses, including Navan and Fairyhouse, to the superb facilities that are available.</P>
      <P>On media coverage of racing, I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the new board to tackle the disgraceful lack of coverage by RTE of the racing industry which is now down to about 27 days a year. Our national station could not find the time or the resources to cover a recent meeting at Fairyhouse on Sunday week of three grade 1 races that brought the attention of radio and television from all over Europe. That meeting was the showpiece of national hunt racing prior to the Christmas meetings at Leopardstown. The board should open negotiations on the coverage of one of our most important indigenous industries.</P>
      <P>There are many other festival meetings that should be covered. I refer to those at Tralee and Listowel in County Kerry. Some effort should be made to cover them. That there is no Irish racing on the racing channel at the moment is a disaster for the industry. As other speakers have mentioned, one of the success stories in sport and otherwise is horse racing, including our horses, trainers and jockeys. The whole industry is a success story world-wide. An opportunity to capitalise on that is being lost and something should be done about that. I hope in the next session we will get an opportunity to have an extensive debate on the whole industry because there are many other facets of it I would like to discuss and on which work needs to be done.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's view that there should be a role for the new board in the appointment of the boards of racecourses that are owned by the racing board. He makes the very valid point that the board, whatever its shape and form, should represent the particular area, whether it is Leopardstown, Fairyhouse or Punchestown. Those courses should have a local appointment to their boards. I have received representations from the Irish Racecourse Association which has also made representations to the Minister on its desire for a second appointment on the board. It makes a point of its commitment of investment in the industry and the fact that it is a shop window for the racecourses.</P>
      <P>The lack of resources for the coverage of a national industry which is a real success story is disgraceful. Will the Minister use his good offices with the board to open up negotiation with a view to increasing coverage of a fast-growing sport in both horse racing and greyhound racing, a growth which the numbers attending through the turnstiles and betting turnover demonstrates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their very positive contributions to the debate. As <Col N="1467" /> always on this subject in this House, the statements and the points made were not only interesting but very constructive and showed a depth of detailed knowledge not just of the overall industry but of the detail of individual racecourses such as Leopardstown as well. This is not surprising. As I have said on many occasions, there is scarcely a town or village in the country that does not benefit in some way from activities associated with racing. The current figure for attendance at horse racing is 1.35 million while approximately one million people attend greyhound racing. In fact, attendances at greyhound racing is rapidly catching up on attendances at horse racing and, judging by the recent fixtures I attended, the age profile of people at the venues is younger.</P>
      <P>Everyone has grown up, in one way or another, with racing. The industry is well worth supporting. I thank the Members who contributed to this debate. I thank Deputy Dukes in particular for how constructively he dealt not only with this Bill but also with the National Stud legislation earlier this year. His amendments to that legislation strengthened the position of the National Stud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was able to accept his amendments then but, regrettably, I cannot accept them on this occasion. The Deputy's amendments relate to racegoers but we have a fundamental difference in how we approach this matter. I believe that when members of HRI attend board meetings they should represent the entire industry. They should not come to the meetings with tags showing that they represent sectors of the industry. They should put that to one side and be the board of directors for the industry and progress it.</P>
      <P>It has been said that there is now good prize money in Ireland. It has improved greatly and compares favourably with our nearest neighbour but it is still far below the prize money in many other countries. It was 27th in the international league but following improvements in the last year or so our position improved by a few points. In fact, I would be delighted if the team I follow in the Premiership, Manchester United, improved its position in that league by the same number of points. Unfortunately, that will take a little longer.</P>
      <P>Even though individuals might be elected by different sectors of the industry, they should represent the entire industry and thereby give the punters and race goers adequate representation. Under the old IHA legislation, I received nominations from racecourse clubs. I appointed one of the nominees but all I got as a result was all kinds of abuse and hassle, so it did not work out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wall, as is his wont, made valuable suggestions, especially in relation to the stable lads and stable girls. They are the mainstay of the industry in Kildare. I was moved to give representation to them on the board and it worked out well. In fact, I called last Sunday to Punchestown and I had a carton of soup there which was lovely. It is the first time that what are called handlers, that is, stable lads and girls, have had the facility to get hot food. It is the same at the new course in Limerick and in a number of others. That has been done and it is a great thing. There are nice showers and changing rooms as well so no more will they have to change in horseboxes. Unfortunately, the restaurant was full of the other members with, as Deputy Dukes described it, their prawn sandwiches and so forth while the poor stable lads and stable girls were left high and dry. I am delighted they are getting a chance for the future.</P>
      <P>The NRA is involved with the road construction so I will have to talk to the authority to see if it can redesign the road. I will reflect on the point raised by Deputy Wright about television coverage of horse racing. Given the percentage of the population that goes racing, there is a dearth of coverage on television. RTE could do far more in that regard. It was starkly brought to my attention last year when the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe was won by a horse trained by John Oxx and ridden by Johnny Murtagh. We still had to watch the race on Channel Four. Irish racing is now a global industry in that the participants, horses, trainers and jockeys are from different parts of Europe, particularly Britain and France. It is a shame that there is not even a wrap up programme in the evening if we cannot watch the racing live. I do not know if we have any influence with RTE any more but we might make representations to the organisation to give this important industry a boost.</P>

      <P>At one time I regularly went to the Phoenix Park. It was great for evening meetings and the fixtures fitted in well with Dáil sittings. It <Col N="1470" /> is a pity it is gone but the future of racing and its development is now a matter for Horse Racing Ireland. It is due to set out a strategic plan for the industry over the next five and ten years. Racecourses, the number of courses and the quality of racing are matters for that body.</P>
      <P>It will have to raise more funds from the industry because the taxpayer cannot continue increasing the amount. We have provided for a fixed amount, which is 5% of the amount of off-course betting. This year it amounted to £46 million, £37 million and £9 million on a one to four basis, but I would like to see that topped up to bring us further up the league. There are rights and various other features to be used but like Leopardstown with its golf course and ancillary businesses, the industry will have to work harder at raising funds and not have the unfortunate taxpayer providing all the funding. I am unable to accede to the amendments proposed by Deputy Dukes. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>I hope one and all will get room at the inn this Christmas, a basic need denied to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem. To many, that saying will be taken literally as getting room at the local pub but it is important to remember those who will get no room at all, particularly the homeless. I refer especially to the volunteers at the Irish Seal Sanctuary who will be put out of a job as well as put out of home, along with their wildlife charges, this Christmas. We should bear in mind their <Col N="1471" /> needs when we think of those most vulnerable in society.</P>

      <Col N="1472" /> It was a difficult year for the agriculture and farming industries.
