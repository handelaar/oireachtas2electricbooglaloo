      <P>I ask that the business of the House be suspended under Standing Order 31 to debate the grave threat posed to international peace and security by the ongoing bombing of Afghanistan by American and British forces, which is being carried out without a UN mandate, has already resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians and threatens the lives of millions of Afghan refugees as the humanitarian crisis worsens. I wish to ascertain what the Government's policy is towards this bombing and the possible widening of the campaign to other countries, and to seek the assent of this House before our airports are further used as part of the American war effort.</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach inform the House what negotiations on Aer Lingus have taken place between the Government and the European Commission which, I understand, is bringing forward a package of proposals to assist European airlines this afternoon? Is the Government disposed to put equity into Aer Lingus or to support it by way of underwriting loans? Will he confirm that the Shannon stop-over is part of the Commission's package, and will he state the Government's attitude to the continuance or otherwise of the Shannon stop-over?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is true. I wish to add to what Deputy Noonan stated. Considering the manner in which the Cahill plan was successfully negotiated and implemented with the help of the social partners, particularly of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is he aware of today's press reports that congress's new secretary general, David Beggs, wrote to the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department seeking an urgent meeting to enable congress to be involved in both the analysis of the problem and, more important, in what will be a difficult solution? Can he give an undertaking that the social partners, particularly congress on behalf of the unions in Aer Lingus, will be involved in ensuring that whatever proposals emerge will have the support of those involved, and that the proposals' implementation will be subject to their agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aer Lingus board met yesterday to be updated on the industry's current state, the company's trading position and the plan that the board and management have prepared to address this serious situation. In that plan which they worked on for some weeks, they have conducted costs analysis, looked at the forward bookings and other matters. It is expected that the plan will be finalised soon for presentation to the Minister for Public Enterprise. Aer Lingus staff and the representatives will be briefed today. The Minister will analyse the situation prior to receipt of the plan and there are contacts between the Minister, her officials, the board and the staff representatives, including congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Brussels, the Minister is preparing for the next transport council meeting on 16 October. She has already been to Brussels in the past week. At the upcoming meeting, the financial situation of European airlines will be dis<Col N="1331" /> cussed, including the EU Commission's proposals for state compensation for the impact of the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to saving Aer Lingus, but only on the basis that it is viable. That is the issue. What is involved is a viability plan to save the company and that is our priority. The Minister for Public Enterprise will work urgently with all the parties in an effort to ensure we will have an airline, however altered in the future, that protects the maximum number of sustainable jobs. We will help in whatever way we can, within the rules.</P>
    <P>I have noted the reports concerning changes in Shannon policy in this morning's newspapers. My information is that they are not being tabled at any meeting in Brussels today. They have not been put forward for discussion today. The Government position remains unaltered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that one of the reasons the Nice Treaty referendum was not passed was the perceived remoteness of the European Commission from the day-to-day concerns of ordinary people. If the EU Commission forces the closure of Aer Lingus by the application of European policy, and leaves 3,000 to 3,500 workers without redundancy payments, the Taoiseach's prospects &ndash; or anybody else's &ndash; of putting the Nice Treaty successfully to the people will be substantially diminished.</P>

      <P>We should not raise a matter which is not an issue and not on today's agenda. It has not been put forward, and I do not believe it will be. The proposition of a future European-US regional area has led some to draw conclusions. However, if it is put forward, the Minister will do what she has always done, and that is reject any policy change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now approximately four years since this House established the Flood tribunal. The nation, and Members on all sides, have been sickened by the stream of disgusting revelations concerning corruption and wrongdoing by a small number of people. In June of this year, the chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Flood, requested of this House additional resources and personnel <Col N="1332" /> to help him in his work, having regard to the longer than expected time that the inquiry has required, and having regard to his imminent retirement. Has the Government considered this matter? Is it in a position to indicate when it will respond formally to Mr. Justice Flood? Can the Taoiseach confirm that before any formal response is made, the parties in this House who are party to the resolution &ndash; because the tribunal, contrary to assertions made by the Taoiseach, was not set up by Fianna Fáil but by this House &ndash; will be consulted as to the identity of those who will be appointed to assist Mr. Justice Flood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any prospect of an interim report from the Flood tribunal, and if such a report is brought forward, will the Taoiseach make arrangements to have it fully debated in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of requests were made by Mr. Justice Flood on staffing and resources and they were dealt with. Mr. Justice Flood made further requests for additional people and I know discussions have taken place on that issue although I do not know exactly what position those discussions have reached. I know that certain names and the availability of those people were discussed last month but that discussion is not concluded. I will check into the matter. When it is known that individuals have become available I will check with the leaders of the House. I will get an update on that.</P>
      <P>There was a view, if it has not been said by Mr. Justice Flood, that there would be an interim report before the summer. That did not happen. It was then suggested that there might be a report before Christmas but I have no information on that matter. If there is a report, it certainly should be debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the request was not to the Government but to this House, and that the Government has the responsibility to co-ordinate the response of this House to the request by Mr. Justice Flood? Will he outline why it has taken such an inordinate length of time to meet this request, having regard to the realities of the situation, and to the fact that some untoward event could cause the tribunal's disappearance? Can the Taoiseach explain the delay? When he refers to the possibility of names being mentioned, who is mentioning the names?</P>

      <P>Some of them are. As I said in reply to Deputy Michael D. Higgins last week, at the justice and home affairs meeting on 24 or 25 September last there was an agreement that all of the outstanding United Nations declarations that had not been signed by member states should be brought forward and that by 7 December as many of those as possible should be enacted. There was also a list of legislation which has been discussed in one form or another arising out of the Tampere meeting in 1999 that should be brought forward urgently. With regard to the UN resolutions, there are about seven or eight items which I mentioned here last Thursday and then there is the legislative measures arising out of Tampere. Following a request from Deputy Michael D. Higgins that they be put on the schedule they will be discussed at the Whips meeting tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that the resolution at the United Nations which requires international co-operation in the fight against terrorism obliges Governments to report within 90 days on what measures they are taking.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is possible. It may not be possible to draft some of the legislation, but <Col N="1335" /> some Bills regarding co-operation on international measures will have to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the issues go back to 1970 so it is the neglect of the House over the past 30 years. Having said that, they were all brought forward into proposals at Tampere two years ago and some of the resolutions were only brought forward to the meeting of the 24th and put forward by the Commission on 24-25 September. There are issues that we have to deal with and I think the Whips will look at them tonight and see how best we can tackle this as it puts us under enormous pressure. Some of the Bills will be drafted quickly while others will take some time, but we have to make an effort to deal with these issues as quickly as we possibly can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted to initiate the debate on the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001. The Bill represents an initiative in the overall strategy of acquiring</P>
      <P>significant artefacts for the main collecting institutions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there was a specific commitment in the Government's &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; to establish a Heritage Fund. This Heritage Fund Bill fully meets that commitment by providing for the establishment of such a fund with an overall limit of £10 million or 12.70 million over a five year period. The conversion of euro amounts has been rounded up.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Heritage Fund is to build up resources, which will be used by the principal State collecting cultural institutions to acquire important items of movable heritage for the national collections that are outstanding examples of their type and pre-eminent in their class. Such items must be such that their loss to the nation would represent a significant deficiency in our heritage collection to be handed on to future generations. These items include such artefacts as archaeological objects, manuscripts, books and works of art that are both rare, costly and are of national importance and that otherwise could not be acquired. In recognition of this, the Bill will only allow for the acquisition of such significant artefacts above a valuation of £250,000 or 317,435. The Bill also allows for the Council of National Cultural Institutions to make recommendations to me on proposed acquisitions using the Heritage Fund in respect of five eligible institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> Section 2 provides a list of the five eligible institutions that will benefit from the Heritage Fund. These are Ireland's principal collecting national institutions and are as follows: the National Archives, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
    <P>Artefacts that are described in the Bill as heritage objects are defined as: any object or collection of objects including archaeological objects, and objects relating to the decorative arts, natural sciences, history, industry or folk-ways; any book or any manuscript, other material or part thereof; copyright in any work, or and similar object or material.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that when a heritage object is being acquired it must be considered appropriate for inclusion in the collection of the relevant eligible institution by the director or chief executive officer of that institution. In the absence of a director or chief executive officer, naturally the Bill allows for a proposed acquisition by any other person at that time, who is performing the functions of director or chief executive officer. The Council of National Cultural Institutions will ultimately decide, before it makes a recommendation to me, if the proposed acquisition is an outstanding example of its type and if it is pre-</P>
    <P>eminent in its class.</P>
    <P>Each eligible institution has its own acquisition budget and will continue to do so. However, many critically important items appropriate to the national collections are being sold on the market for prices far in excess of the financial resources available in normal circumstances to the institutions. It is only fitting therefore that this fund is established to make further financial resources available for the acquisition of heritage objects. It will allow for the purchase of important and major artefacts that these institutions may not have been in a position to acquire heretofore. I stress that, as these institutions are national institutions, it is vital for the safeguarding of Ireland's heritage and culture that significant acquisitions are made to expand their collections not only for Irish people to appreciate and admire but also from an educational and research view point. Such acquisitions will provide an added attraction in encouraging overseas visitors to Ireland. The Heritage Fund is principally a fund for the acquisition of outstanding artefacts and should not be perceived as a grant scheme for the purchase of artefacts generally.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill deals with the operation of the Heritage Fund. Following consultation with me, it allows for the fund to consist of such accounts as the Minister for Finance may determine. It also contains provisions in section 3(3), with regard to accounting procedures so that the operation of the fund will be clear and transparent. It stipulates that not later than three months after the end of each financial year, I, as Minister, shall submit the accounts of the fund to <Col N="1340" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. I shall also cause a copy of an abstract of the audited accounts together with a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. This will be conducted no later than three months following my receipt of the relevant report.</P>
    <P>Section 3(4) contains a provision for the Minister for Finance to manage the fund. The Bill allows for any moneys standing to the credit of the fund that are not, for the time being required for the purpose of making payments, to be invested by the Minister for Finance. This includes such securities, other than shares in a company, that the Minister for Finance considers appropriate. It also allows for investment with any credit institution in the currency of the State, whether within the State or not. The Minister for Finance may also from time to time at his or her discretion vary or sell any investments made by him or her. All income received from investments along with the proceeds of the sale of any such investments will be paid into the fund.</P>
    <P>To build up financial resources to the limit of £10 million, the Bill allows for Exchequer funds to be paid into the fund from the Vote of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It will permit funds to be accumulated subject to an overall limit of £10 million or 12.70 million as follows: the sum of £3 million in the financial year of 2001, which is provided for in this year's estimate; the sum of £2 million in each of the financial years 2002, 2003, and 2004, and finally, the sum of £1 million in the financial year of 2005. Obviously, moneys standing to the credit of the fund shall not be used for any purposes other than those specified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to Exchequer funding, other methods of increasing the amount in the Heritage Fund are proposed in section 6 of the Bill. Following a recommendation from the Council of National Cultural Institutions, I, as Minister, may accept a gift of moneys or land, for the purpose of benefiting the fund. The Bill also stipulates in section 6(3) that I cannot accept a gift of moneys, land or other property if the trusts or conditions attached to it would be inconsistent with my functions or the functions of the Minister for Finance under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to payments out of the fund, section 7 provides that following a recommendation from the Council of National Cultural Institutions, I, as Minister, may pay out of the fund an amount of money. This payment will be for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, any expenditure incurred in purchasing a heritage object, where I consider it appropriate to do so. The Bill, however, stipulates that a payment will not be made out of the fund for a purpose specified if the fair market value of the heritage object concerned is less than £250,000 or such greater amount as may be specified by an order made with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The purpose of the fund is to acquire uniquely <Col N="1341" /> important heritage items. It is not a general top-up for annual acquisition budgets.</P>
    <P>Any payment of moneys out of the fund shall be made to the person who has incurred or will incur the expenditure concerned or, as the case may be, has incurred or will incur the liability to defray such expenditure. This will, in most cases, be the appropriate eligible institution or their appointed agents. As the Minister for Finance manages the fund, payments shall only be made out of the fund with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On the subject of accountability, section 8 of the Bill provides for the preparation and publishing of an annual report. In accordance with this provision of the Bill, I will arrange to prepare a report with respect to the operation of the fund during the relevant financial year and arrange for copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published. This will be carried out every year and within a timeframe of not later than three months from the end of each appropriate financial year. It is my intention that the annual report and accounts will be produced in both the Irish and English languages and I propose to give statutory effect to this by way of Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>On Part 3 of the Bill, it is crucial that there are mechanisms to ensure that the heritage fund is used effectively and productively. On 21 October 1998, I officiated at the inaugural meeting of the Council of National Cultural Institutions, which was established by me in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The purpose of the council is to pool together the collective resources of talent, experience and vision of the member institutions in furtherance of the national cultural interest. Under this Bill, the Council of National Cultural Institutions will have statutory power and responsibility to make recommendations to me in relation to acquisitions using this fund.</P>
    <P>The council comprises the directors or chief executives of the following cultural institutions: the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Concert Hall, the Chester Beatty Library, the National Theatre Society Limited and the National Archives.</P>
    <P>To date, the council has worked exceptionally well. It has undertaken research and development programmes. Several working groups have been established and areas of common concern such as information technology, marketing, education and training have been examined. Under the council, the information exchange emanating from the contacts between the staff from the various institutions has proved extremely valuable. I emphasise that this Bill will allow the council to continue with its present work programme and meet in a non-statutory setting whereby the members will continue to co-operate on matters of mutual interest and concern. The council's <Col N="1342" /> work programme will continue as before. This Bill only contains statutory provisions relating to the powers being given under it to the Council of National Cultural Institutions relating to the heritage fund.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill confers powers to allow the council to hold meetings to discuss the proposals for expenditure from the heritage fund as the members deem to be necessary and, accordingly, to make recommendations to me relating to acquisitions using the fund. At a meeting of the council, members who are present will select a chairperson of the meeting. Every question that falls to be decided at a meeting of the council shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present. In the case of an equal division of votes, the chairperson of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote. The council may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies among its members and the members will regulate their procedures by rules or otherwise. The Bill allows for ten members of the council and provides that the quorum for a meeting is given as six.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for the disclosure of certain interests by members of council and the prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of information. With reference to section 11, covering the disclosure of interests by council members, a member will inform the meeting if he or she has an interest in the matter being discussed and will disclose details of such interest and the nature thereof. The disclosure will then be recorded in the minutes of the meeting concerned and, for so long as the matter to which the disclosure relates is being dealt with by the meeting, the member by whom the disclosure is made shall not take part in the deliberation of the meeting on that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 12 covers the prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of information. A person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing duties as a member of the council during meetings held to discuss the heritage fund.</P>
    <P>The provisions under sections 11 and 12 of the Bill are standard. However, I would like to put on the record of the House that I am anxious to ensure that the provisions in this Bill do not give rise to potential conflict between the roles of the directors or chief executives as council members and their role towards their respective boards. In this regard, officials from my Department have met the council members and discussed this issue at length. As a result of these meetings, I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage to provide greater certainty and security in this regard. These amendments will be in addition to two other technical amendments which I will also move on Committee Stage. Section 13, which deals with penalties, is broadly a standard provision.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Heritage Fund Bill, I have been aware that questions have been raised about the future of the existing tax relief <Col N="1343" /> scheme for donations of important national heritage items. I emphasise that the provisions contained in the Heritage Fund Bill are entirely separate from, but complementary to, the provisions already contained in the scheme for tax relief for donation of heritage objects, as provided for under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 176 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>It is worth referring to the success of this latter scheme in attracting the donation of important national heritage items to the Irish national collections. A tax credit equal to the value of the heritage item or items donated is allowed to the donor, which can then be credited against particular tax liabilities incurred by the donor. This tax legislative provision has had significant positive impacts on the collecting national cultural institutions since its enactment. Many outstanding items have been donated to the various national cultural institutions through this provision. These include, by way of recent example, the Brian Friel Archive to the National Library of Ireland. This collection comprises all original workings and manuscripts of Brian Friel's plays, as well as large quantities of his correspondence with other contemporary Irish writers and artists.</P>
    <P>Under the tax donation scheme, the National Gallery of Ireland acquired the beautiful and delightful painting entitled &ldquo;A Musical Party&rdquo; by the Dutch artist van Honthorst. Those of you who are familiar with the world of art will know that this painting was once displayed in the Casino at Marino as part of Lord Charlemont's collection. Another significant donation concerns a collection of modern art, the Maurice Foley collection. This collection comprises an important and varied collection of 20th century art which was donated to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. This was a truly important addition to the museum's collection.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the existing tax relief scheme for donations of important national heritage items will continue in tandem with the heritage fund. Although they are two entirely separate schemes, both mechanisms can work alongside one another to ensure that the national cultural institutions build substantially on their present collections.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that it is not possible to forecast what will be purchased for the institutions under the heritage fund. By way of example, however, I want to draw the Deputies' attention to the acquisition of the &ldquo;Circe&rdquo; manuscript in December of last year. I was successful in acquiring this wonderful 27 page manuscript for the National Library of Ireland. This manuscript is regarded as the centrepiece of James Joyce's masterpiece <i>Ulysses.</i> The sale of this exceptional Joyce manuscript attracted huge international interest and there was a fear that its eventual home would not be Ireland. This would have been a great pity as, apart from some note sheets in the British Library, there is no other <Col N="1344" /><i>Ulysses</i> material in Ireland or, indeed, throughout the whole of Europe. In the absence of a statutory fund it was only possible to acquire this artefact because of additional funding made available by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. Otherwise this magnificent treasure could have been lost to a private collector or possibly to an overseas library. The Deputies will recall that the manuscript was purchased for $1.4 million. It is now on exhibition in the National Library and has been viewed by many visitors. It is also available to Joycean scholars and academics and has been described as one of the most intriguing Joyce manuscripts as it produces many insights concerning the composition of &ldquo;Circe&rdquo; and of <i>Ulysses.</i>I reiterate the importance of the heritage fund. This will be the first time the national collecting cultural institutions will have additional funding to enable them to expand their collections with significant and important artefacts. The Deputies will appreciate that £3 million or 3.81 million has already been provided for in my Department's Estimate for this year for payment into the fund when established. Clearly it is of the utmost importance therefore that the Bill is enacted in the current financial year and I would welcome the co-operation of the House in securing this objective. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister back again in sparkling form after her summer holidays. One could say that the genesis of this Bill was the report of the committee concerned with the outflow of works of art chaired by the distinguished judge, the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, which was published by the then Government in December 1985 and which is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Fund Bill or An Bille um Chiste Oidhreachta goes some way towards addressing what was contained in the White Paper on Cultural Policy Access and Opportunity, which was identified as an important goal in the creation of an overall national cultural policy. In that White Paper, published in January 1987, with a foreword by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitz-</P>
      <P>Gerald and the former Minister of State with responsibility for Arts and Culture, Mr. Ted</P>
      <P>Nealon, Chapter 4, paragraph 8, states:</P>
      <P>The retention in Ireland of works of arts, arts objects and other heritage material:</P>
      <P>Because of his concern that the State is not in a position to exercise any effective control over the export of works of art and other valuable heritage material, the Minister of State for Arts and Culture, in February 1985, established an Advisory Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court, to consider the whole question of the outflow of works of art and other heritage material from the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Government committed itself to ordering legislation which would give effect to the <Col N="1345" /> Hamilton committee report as recommended by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton in his report to the then Minister, Mr. Ted Nealon. The Government proposed the following at paragraph 4.10 of the White Paper on Culture, Access and Opportunity:</P>
    <P>As recommended by the committee the new legislation will seek to introduce an effective licensing system governing the export of works of arts and also a wide range of material over 50 years old and not included in the present legislation.</P>
    <P>That was in 1987 and the system is still operative today under the Regulations of Export Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that such a time has elapsed between the Government White Paper, the Hamilton report and the introduction by the Minister of a Bill which seeks to give effect to some of the considerations then enunciated. Mar a deir an sean fhocail, &ldquo;Is fearr go mall ná go brách&rdquo;. The fact is that, incredibly, the 1945 Act is the only determining Act and the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001, as presented, is quite flawed as proposed legislation dealing with the issue or issues of heritage. The Bill has a very wide scope and for that reason it deserves considerable scrutiny. It requires a number of amendments if it is to achieve what we hope it would in preserving important strands of our heritage and adding to the national heritage collection in the interest of the community.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Bill proposes the establishment of a heritage fund with a limit of £10 million to enable designated institutions to purchase or acquire items of heritage which the Minister in her explanatory memorandum defines as &ldquo;items of movable heritage&rdquo;. There is no definition in the Bill as proposed as to what an &ldquo;item of movable heritage&rdquo; is or may be. However, the Bill contains references to the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000. Section 2 of that Act gives a definition of &ldquo;artistic works&rdquo; and this is obviously the meaning attaching to items of movable heritage intended by the Minister in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;artistic work&rdquo; includes a work of any of the following descriptions, irrespective of their artistic quality&ndash;</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;a)photographs, paintings, drawings, diagrams, maps, charts, plans, engravings, etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, prints or similar works, collages or sculptures (including any cast or model made for the purpose of a sculpture);</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;b)works of architecture, being either buildings or models for buildings, and works of artistic craftsmanship;</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;c)works of artistic craftsmanship;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 2000 Act also includes a definition of &ldquo;anonymous work&rdquo; which is relevant to our considerations here. As the definitions of &ldquo;artistic <Col N="1346" /> works&rdquo;, including those of unknown authors, are the subject of this legislation, these definitions should be incorporated in the legislation for clarity, particularly as the Bill proposes the expenditure of moneys from the Exchequer &ndash; the Heritage Fund &ndash; to be established under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Hamilton report was concerned with the loss to the national heritage collection by the export of works of heritage and sought, for that purpose, to empower the directors of the National Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum and the National Archives in the matter of issuing export licences where appropriate. The Hamilton report also recommended that a moratorium be established whereby the State might take the opportunity of purchasing or otherwise acquiring the object or objects and that a system of arbitration would be established to which owners might have recourse in order to arrive at a fair price.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Fund Bill, 2001, might at first sight seem to be a good idea. I support the idea of establishing a heritage fund to acquire and preserve important items of heritage value. Most important also is the idea that acquired items of heritage should be accessible to the community. This is an ambition which we could all share. There are, however, provisions within it which would seriously damage the future and fabric of the national heritage collection. The Bill primarily proposes that a range of Dublin city institutions should be at the centre of what would be a national listing of all important objects of heritage and that the directors of those Dublin based institutions would have between them the capacity to advise the Minister to acquire by purchase or otherwise items of heritage for their institutions. In other words, what remains of objects of heritage and cultural importance would in time be all moved to Dublin. This form of cultural centralisation is entirely unacceptable and undemocratic. It is, as a proposition, against all the thinking of the State and its administration given that decentralisation is at the core of all our thinking nowadays. Whatever about the State and its administrative system, the idea in the 21st century of creating a super cultural centre in Dublin is fundamentally wrong. Such an idea strikes at the very core of what we understand the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; to mean.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes in section 9 to establish a body to be known as the Council of National Cultural Institutions of which the following will be members: the Director of the National Museum of Science and Art; the Director of the National Library of Ireland; the Director of the National Gallery of Ireland; the Director of the Arts Council; the Chief Executive Officer of the Heritage Council; the Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company Limited; the Director of the National Concert Hall Company Limited; the Director of the Chester Beatty Library; the Artistic Director of the National Theatre Society Limited and the <Col N="1347" /> Director of the National Archives. The members of this council will determine and advise the Minister to which of the eligible institutions an item or items of heritage, purchased or otherwise acquired by or through the heritage fund, shall be located and included in the collection of that eligible institution.</P>
    <P>The eligible institutions for the purposes of the Bill are at section 2. These include the National Archives; the National Gallery of Ireland; the National Library of Ireland; the National Museum of Science and Art and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister being the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is central to the whole operation and it is she who will determine &ldquo;where he or she considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo; what moneys and how much will be spent on the advice of the proposed Council of National Cultural Institutions. This places the Minister in a rather invidious position and the Bill does not provide for the kind of transparency now required in all these matters.</P>
    <P>To return to the matter of eligible institutions and to the membership of the Minister's cultural council, I stressed at the outset that the use of the heritage fund to acquire important items of cultural and heritage value is an important development, which I support. I also stated that such items acquired through the fund should be made accessible in so far as that can be done by exhibiting them or otherwise locating them in such a way that the community as a whole would have access to them. The Minister proposes, however, that the fund should be used to add to the collections of five institutions &ndash; admittedly national institutions with which we are all familiar &ndash; all located in Dublin city. Furthermore, the membership of the Minister's proposed Council of National Cultural Institutions is confined to Dublin-based institutions. Why is this so? </P>
    <P>In Dublin, why is Marsh's Library, the Dublin Civic Museum and the Hugh Lane Gallery,</P>
    <P>Parnell Square, not included in the list of eligible institutions? What are we saying about the other galleries and cultural centres throughout the country such as the Crawford in Cork, the Hunt Museum and the City Museum in Limerick, the National Self Portrait Collection in the University of Limerick, the two arts galleries in Waterford &ndash; my colleague, Deputy O'Shea would be more familiar with them &ndash; the museums in Sligo, Kilkenny and Drogheda, Monaghan County Museum, and in my own county the County Museum in Letterkenny and the Glebe Gallery at Church Strand, Baltimore which the Minister visited last year? There are other centres such as the Ballinglen Gallery in Mayo, and Cill Rialaig in Kerry, which I had the pleasure of visiting just a month ago.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divisive when one considers the geographical antagonisms developed within it. Are we saying that these cultural centres outside Dublin are not worthy or capable of housing items <Col N="1348" /> of heritage? Are we to read into the Minister's proposals that she does not wish to develop and encourage the establishment of new institutions throughout the country? Every county should have or be encouraged to have a museum, an art gallery and a heritage centre. The national collection should be made accessible to the entire community. This Bill proposes creating a quarantine in which only some Dublin locations will be favoured with future financial capacity to add to their collections.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister might have considered the inclusion of representatives of county managers and the General Council of County Councils in the Council of National Cultural Institutions. This would not only encourage those county councils which have already established galleries and museums but most importantly those councils who have not as yet done so.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which concerns me on which I would like clarification from the Minister. Section 6, and the subsections thereto, mention the &ldquo;gift of land or other property&rdquo; which the Minister may on the advice of the Council of National Cultural Institutions accept for the benefit of the Heritage Fund with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The Minister has gone some way towards explaining this provision. Is it an introduction into the Bill of section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997? The Minister says it is quite separate from that provision, but that it is complementary. If tax relief is available under the provisions of section 6 then this method of reclaiming part of the national heritage should be more fully explored and stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In some respects the Bill in its present form provides for centralised grabbing, with the location, purchase and removal of every yet to be identified new item of heritage and culture to five institutions in Dublin. Because of the long delay in dealing with the Hamilton report, perhaps the Bill should contain some references to extra territorial acquisition policy. Essentially we need to know what has gone out of the country since the establishment of the State and where and what it is. Books, book collections and manuscript letters come to mind, but I am sure there are other items, many of them carried by our people in their ventures abroad. What remains of their collections should be brought back home.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position regarding Northern Ireland. Would works of artistic merit originating in Northern Ireland be considered for purchase or would such items be ineligible due to their origins? I hope we will not approach it in such a serious partitionist manner.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes any proposal which seeks to hold in the public interest objects of heritage and for those to be housed or held in places and in circumstances which would provide the citizen with reasonable access to such objects.</P>
    <P>We find a number of things wrong with the Bill. Although the Minister's explanatory memorandum suggests that the Heritage Fund to be established by the Bill has as its purpose the <Col N="1349" /> acquisition for the national collection of items of movable heritage, there is no definition of movable heritage for that purpose in the Bill as presented nor is the term mentioned.</P>
    <P>The eligible institutions are solely Dublin based. The provisions, therefore, take no account of the necessity and increasing demand by those outside the Dublin area to have access to part of the national heritage. The definition of eligible institutions should be revised to include other important institutions and collections outside the Dublin area and where necessary new structures should be put in place to establish the location of important heritage collections outside the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>Membership of the council should include a representative membership of those local authority areas which have developed heritage services and particularly those areas which have municipal galleries or other appropriate institutions and have curatorial expertise, such as Limerick and Cork.</P>
    <P>Having identified some of the shortcomings and omissions, I generally welcome the Bill. It is a good idea, especially for large purchases above and beyond the normal scale of acquisitions. However, existing funds for the purchase of acquisitions by the individual institutions must be kept in place separately. This fund must be additional rather than a replacement of existing funds. The Minister has clarified in her speech that each eligible institution will continue to hold its own acquisition fund and that the additional funding from the Heritage Council will augment existing funds.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will table a number of amendments to this very important Bill which in some ways represents a new departure. I hope it will be referred to the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language, of which I and Deputy O'Shea are members, so we can tease out the details at greater length.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfáiltím roimh an mBille seo, sílim go bhfuil lochtanna agus laigí go leor ag baint leis. An locht is mó go bhfuil aire an Bhille dírithe go hiomlán ar chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath. Na hinstitiúidí uilig a ghnóthaíonn de bharr an Bhille, tá siad uilig lonnaithe san ard-chathair agus tá baill uile Chomhairle Institiúidí Chultúrtha Náisiúnta i mBaile Átha Cliath. Déantar neamh-shuim ar fad ar na hiarsmalanna agus na hionaid cultúrtha eile ar fud na tíre. Ní shílim go n-aithníonn an Bille seo an polasaí dí-láraithe, a ba chóir a bheith ag gach Roinn agus an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán san áireamh.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an gheallúint a thug an t-Aire, nuair a bheas tuairisc an choiste á chur ar fáil gach bliain go mbeidh sé dhá-theangach, i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge. Is rud maith é sin mar go bhfuilimid ag déileáil leis an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, i measc cúramaí eile atá ar an Roinn sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille um Chiste Oidhreachta, 2001. Tá an Bille an-thábhachtach <Col N="1350" /> agus tá áthas orm labhairt sa díospóireacht ar an Dara Chéim de. Tá a fhios ag Páirtí an Lucht Oibre go bhfuil sé práinneach go mbeidh an Bille ina Acht go luath agus beimid ag cabhrú leis an Aire an Bille a sheoladh tríd an Dáil chomh tapaidh agus is féidir. While the establishment of the heritage fund is very welcome, there are other areas of our heritage which require urgent attention and funding. The artefacts, which come within the remit of the heritage fund, must have a valuation of £250,000 at least. The result of a survey commissioned by the National Heritage Council relating to the State's 27,000 stone structures and monuments carried out by experts from the Dublin Institute of Technology and Trinity College was published last May. It was found that one-third of the stone structures and monuments were significantly damaged or suffering neglect. It was further found that one in five is affected by intensive stone decay and one in ten shows so much damage that they are in danger of collapse.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council, based on the findings of the survey of 112 monuments in 14 counties, view this as urgent. Among the monuments most at risk is one in my constituency &ndash; the frieze carvings at Ardmore Cathedral in County Waterford.</P>
      <P>The chief archaeologist with the Heritage Council, Mr. Charles Mount, stated that in many cases as little as £900 could save monuments for another 20 years. Mr. Michael Starrett, chief executive of the Heritage Council, considers the situation urgent as the stock of stone monuments is a distinctive cultural resource representing 6,000 years of activity in the landscape. There is an obvious need to address this problem in a structured way with the appropriate level of resources.</P>
      <P>This is just one aspect of our heritage. Conservation and preservation are costly, but must be seen in the context of a long-term investment. Perhaps there is another model which could be used to set up a fund to address the urgent problems with the State's stone monuments and structures.</P>
      <P>Only 800 to 900 of the 27,000 stone monuments and structures in the State belong to the Government. Most of them belong to the Church of Ireland, the Catholic Church or are the responsibility of local authorities. Churches and local authorities often do not have the funds to look after the elements of the nation's priceless architectural heritage within their care. Whereas the Bill does not address this issue, it does require the Minister's immediate attention.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001, which is a short Bill. We are aware of the urgency of having the Bill enacted so that the financial provision made in the Estimates in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands Vote for 2001 can be applied to the new fund. The Labour Party will facilitate the early passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have a number of observations. It seems extraordinary that a Bill dealing with a <Col N="1351" /> heritage fund should have so little of the Irish language in its text. Other than the short title and the long title of the Bill and the phrase: &ldquo;Mar a tionscnaíodh&rdquo;, I find no other phrase from the Irish language in the text. This seems extraordinary in a Bill emanating from the Department with special responsibility for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge has put forward three amendments which the Minister should add to the Bill as a minimum. She has already addressed the first one relating to having the annual report in both official languages. This is a practice that is followed by the Heritage Council, an Comhairle Oidhreachta, in its policy paper on heritage awareness in Ireland. I compliment the Minister confirming today that she will introduce an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the Council of National Cultural Institutions. The Labour Party will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to add to the text the Irish language version of the proposed council, Comhairle na nInstitiút Náisiúnta Cultúrtha. I earnestly request the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>In Part 3 dealing with the National Council of Cultural Institutions and in particular section 10, the Labour Party will by way of amendment seek the insertion of a new subsection to read: &ldquo;a meeting may be conducted through the medium of the Irish or English language&rdquo;. Against the background of Bille na Gaeilge, which is to be published in spring 2002 by the Minister's Department, this is a necessary addition to this Bill. Bille na Gaeilge is to provide a framework for the delivery of State services bilingually or through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There may be other sections of the Bill which could be improved by additional insertions in the Irish language. The Labour Party will further examine the Bill with a view to putting down further amendments in this regard. The Minister should accept the principle involved here and I encourage her to bring forward her own amendments relating to the Irish language and the Heritage Fund Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the Minister shall out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, pay into the fund moneys totalling £10 million by the financial year 2005. The Bill also provides for the acceptance of gifts of money to the fund and the proceeds of the sale or other disposals of any gift of land or other property accepted by the Minister. However, there is a question of replenishing the fund after a large purchase or purchases have been made. What provision is there to keep the fund up to its permitted level of £10 million?</P>
    <P>I fully accept the concept of private gifts of money being added to the fund as well as the proceeds of the sale or other disposal of any gift of land or other property and the Council of National Cultural Institutions should be proactive <Col N="1352" /> in identifying and encouraging benefactors to the heritage fund. Another obvious role for the Council of National Cultural Institutions should be the encouragement of donations of heritage objects to the State's cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>With regard to payments out of the fund, the Bill provides that no payment shall be paid out of the fund for the specific purposes in subsection (1) if the fair market value of the heritage object concerned is, in the opinion of the Minister, less than £250,000 or such greater amount as may be specified by order of the Minister made with the consent of the Minister for Finance. In summing up at the end of Second Stage, the Minister might explain how the figure of £250,000 was reached.</P>
    <P>The definition of heritage object in the interpretation section is quite wide and that is welcome. Paragraph (f2&gt;a) reads &ldquo;any object or collection of objects including archaeological objects and objects relating to the decorative arts, natural sciences, history, industry or folkways.&rdquo; In the context the eligible institutions, it is equally important that sufficient accommodation and staff resources should be allocated to these institutions to ensure the maximum access to the public to view existing heritage objects and objects to be acquired in the future. This is particularly true of the national archives.</P>
    <P>We all recall the incident that occurred in early 2000 regarding the missing files, which were not missing but misplaced. That incident underlined the need to properly fund the archives. The staff at the National Archives invariably come in for favourable comment from those requiring their services when seeking to access papers in the care of the National Archives. The Minister informed my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, in response to a parliamentary question last July, that the Department of Finance had recently sanctioned the recruitment of additional staff for the National Archives and that those positions would be filled as soon as possible. That measure was seen as helping to address the staffing difficulties faced by the National Archives, which had been mentioned in a recent report of the national archives advisory body.</P>
    <P>Accommodation was also referred to by the national archives advisory body and the Minister, responding to my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, also stated:</P>
    <P>This development was planned to address one issue in particular for the National Archives which was the long-term storage needs. Following a report by consultants on the scope of the requirements for the adaptation and extension of existing facilities, design proposals which had been prepared were extended to encompass the full range of activities in the National Archives and not just storage. This plan envisaged a much larger building with new road frontage and providing greater on-site storage and office facilities, reading and public spaces.</P>
    <P>Discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance have resulted in sanction to pro<Col N="1353" /> ceed with a major redevelopment scheme for the archives and examination of the project as a potential public private partnership, PPP. An initial order of cost from the project is £45 million. This development will meet the staffing and user and storage needs of this vital institution well in the future.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned that this project is being examined in the context of public private partnership because, in principle, I would have a concern about our national heritage being in other than the hands of the State. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on that because the State should see its role at all times in terms of improving accommodation, providing the requisite staff numbers and generally making the facilities and the heritage items available over the longest possible period of time in the course of any week. If we bring in public private partnerships, we are introducing a profit element and whereas there are areas in which that can be examined in a different context, I am far from sure that this is the correct way to proceed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us, first, if the positions authorised by the Department of Finance towards the middle of the year have been filled? Second, has any substantial or real progress been made in regard to the accommodation project? Third, will she enlighten us as to the philosophy behind the idea of having a private partner involved with our National Archives? I remain to be convinced in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley spoke in general about our national heritage items being available as widely as possible throughout the country. In the early 1980s, a friend of mine dug up a Bronze Age grave behind his house while he was excavating to build a garage, as far as I can recall. I contacted the National Museum and the then keeper of Irish antiquities came down and took away an urn which had been in the grave. The urn had been damaged. It was found within a small chamber, about two feet by one foot by one foot, and the keeper of Irish antiquities dated it as somewhere between 1600 and 2000 BC. He also informed us that there were developments in relation to how these graves were constructed, the way the human remains were treated and that, generally, these graves came in 15s. Apparently, within the urn there would have been the ashes of the deceased person &ndash; the remains would have been cremated &ndash; but also, interestingly, some oats so the idea of an after-life existed even at that stage. The oats were seen as food for the journey. That is the background to that story. That item, which went to the National Museum for study and so on, should have been, at least for some part of its life, exhibited in the local heritage centre. I realise there are security issues involved in that and that some artefacts require the proper environment to safeguard them, but as Deputy</P>
    <P>McGinley said, we need to get artefacts out into localities where they have a particular relevance. That is vital in the context of teaching history, <Col N="1354" /> particularly in national schools because if a love of history is inculcated, that remains with the person for life.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley and I were national teachers and it has been our experience that the old style of teaching history, whereby one dealt with the major national events, does not stimulate the minds of young people. The real introduction to history is in the locality with the local stories, the historical events which occurred there, the monuments and other historical buildings which remain there. I accept the principle that we need central repositories for heritage items and I support the thrust of the Bill but there is a strong case to be made for sharing those items, albeit for limited periods, with the growing number of heritage centres and art galleries of high quality which are developing throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the disclosure of certain interests by members of the Council of National Cultural Institutions. That is a normal and necessary provision. Section 12 deals with the prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>The observance of that section is fundamental to ensuring that the taxpayer gets the best possible return in the context of the purchase of heritage objects with a value of £250,000 or more. An essential function of the council should be to be up to date in terms of heritage artefacts that may come up for sale or on which a sale could be negotiated. Again, it is essential that the council assumes a proactive role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The penalties under sections 11 and 12 provide for a fine not exceeding £1,500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. In view of the issues involved I question if the fine or sentence, or combination of both, are severe enough in the unlikely event that the provisions of these sections are breached. The</P>
    <P>Labour Party will examine this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister indicated that following discussions with her officials and the various collecting institutions involved she would move amendments to these sections. We cannot comment on these until we see them. While the issue of security is essential, any difficulties involving possible clashes between the role of chief executives of collecting institutions and their role on the national council should be resolved and I compliment the Minister for addressing that aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the need for a fund was underlined last December when she assisted the National Library to purchase the manuscripts for<i> Ulysses</i> when they were auctioned by Christies in New York. The auction price of £1.4 million was nominally high but not in terms of what the manuscript means in the context of our national heritage. A fund of £10 million would cover the cost of retrieving many heritage artefacts but I hope allowance will be made where the retrieval of objects of great national importance requires funding greater than this amount. Will the Mini<Col N="1355" /> ster confirm that in such instances nothing will prevent her from taking the necessary action?</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a heritage fund and I look forward to it becoming operative as soon as possible. Will the Minister indicate if the Bill has been examined in the context of the proposed Bille na Gaeilge? I understand from the list received from the Chief Whip that the heads of that Bill have been agreed and it will be published in the spring. Has the Minister taken steps to ensure that the provisions of this Bill conform with it? I raise this issue because of the need to ensure that all legislation before the House is proofed against the terms of Bille na Gaeilge. This Bill was examined in the context of poverty proofing and the same criteria should apply to proofing it against the provisions of Bille na Gaeilge. It appears this Bill has not been adequately scrutinised in terms of the Irish language, which suggests a lack of co-ordination within the Department. I am also concerned that Departments may not be in sufficient contact when legislation is being drafted.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that the proposed heritage fund will deal with objects that are, in the main, proper for preservation in institutions in central locations. However, there is also a need to ensure that heritage is shared throughout the State. The sharing of our heritage with EU member states and other countries is to be welcomed but we should also ensure that important artefacts within this State are not confined to Dublin. An innovative approach is required to ensure that they are made available to the wider public, especially young people. There is a need to develop a culture of interest in objects throughout the country. A way of doing this is to encourage students and the wider community to research objects in terms of their history, etc. These objects belong to the wider public and they should not be confined to scholars or those living in or visiting the capital city.</P>
    <P>While this wider agenda cannot be addressed in legislation of this kind, it would be helpful to the House if the Minister will give assurances about her positive attitude to what has been suggested by Deputy McGinley and me. She should adopt a proactive and sympathetic approach to ensuring there is universal access to as many of our important artefacts as possible. The Labour Party will propose amendments on Committee Stage in the spirit of assisting the Minister pass the Bill into law as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is excellent legislation. Its purpose is to establish a heritage fund to enable the State's cultural institutions acquire items on behalf of the public. It is surprising there has not been such a fund and I am pleased the Minister has recognised the need for it and is putting it on a firm legislative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to moveable heritage, such as artefacts, books and works of art, that are rare and have a value over £250,000 and, a key issue, <Col N="1356" /> that are of national importance. They do not have to be Irish but I am pleased to note that if they are of importance to the nation or the public they will be covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>We have had much discussion here and I listened carefully to the spokespersons for Fine Gael and Labour describing how these institutions are generally located in Dublin. They said it is important that people throughout the country have the benefit of being able to see these artefacts when they are bought and acquired for the general public. I agree with that. I am sure the Minister will find out if there is a practical way of achieving that.</P>
    <P>Another thing that came to mind as I listened to the Deputies opposite was the question of an all-Ireland dimension to the fund. This is just the type of fund to operate on a North-South basis under the all-Ireland institutions. Clearly there are heritage matters which are common to the island as a whole and not merely particular to this State. When this legislation is in place, or before it is finalised, that issue should be addressed. There is much shared heritage in Ireland and it is important that we in this House take a pro-active approach. This is a very straightforward area in which we could have excellent co-operation on the basis of funding being made available North and South.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister for her work on heritage and the arts. Deputy O'Shea will understand when I say that in our most inland county, Laois, the Minister's role in relation to the islands has little or no impact. I hate to say it but it is a fact. There is no Gaeltacht in Laoighis or Offaly and we are not good Gaelic speakers. We learned our Irish from teachers who came up from Kerry or across from the west and we have what we call &ldquo;a smudge of Leinster Irish&rdquo;. That is as far as I would go. I have noticed in recent years that our heritage has assumed a level of importance in the Irish psyche that it did not have for generations. There are probably historical reasons people did not like to dwell on their heritage. They might not like to look at some of the good and not so good aspects of it.</P>
    <P>This legislation is nationally important and the Minister has specified that the funding available in year 1 is £3 million, with £2 million in each of the three years following and £1 million in the last year, bringing the fund total to £10 million. Perhaps the Minister will agree that while this is an excellent start, we could not ever be satisfied that the fund would stop at that level of contribution in the years to come. The agreement of the Minister for Finance would probably have to be sought as well. As our awareness of heritage increases there is a greater public demand for the State to ensure that items of national importance are acquired for the people, rather than allowed to go overseas or remain there if they have already gone. I hope the Minister will allow some flexibility in the fund in its earliest years when it has not fully been built up. If major items come to light that need to be acquired on behalf of the <Col N="1357" /> people there should be flexibility at Government level. I am sure nobody here would have a difficulty agreeing an additional Estimate to acquire such artefacts if that had to be done in the course of any year.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see the section in the legislation allowing private donations to be made to the fund. I assume the same type of tax credits and concessions will be available to the people who make such donations as already exist. There is one thing I would like clarified before the legislation is finalised. It is mentioned that where a gift of land or other property is made the value of it can be realised for the benefit of the fund. Perhaps the item of property should be kept intact and not realised. It should be handed over to one of the collecting institutions rather than have its value realised.</P>
    <P>I was especially pleased that the Minister in his speech referred to the existing tax reliefs for donations of important national heritage items. I have a general idea about that, but I do not know how much is involved. It seems to be working very well. The Minister emphasised that this legislation is complementary and in addition to the provisions in the Tax Consolidation Act, 1997. It does not infringe or diminish it. It will make additional funding available for heritage.</P>
    <P>I would like to find out during the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas how much has been given in tax credits in each of the past few years under this heading. Is it £100,000 or £10 million per year? The Minister will probably have to find out from the Minister for Finance. If the Exchequer is giving these tax credits, I would like to know how much is involved. Maybe it is a great deal, maybe it is a little. I am sure the Revenue Commissioners have that information as they deal with individual donors and will know what cases we are talking about. I am not asking for the names of the donors. I just want to know the funds being granted by way of tax credit on behalf of the Exchequer. That information would be valuable to the House.</P>
    <P>Over the summer months I read an article in a magazine that I am sure is well read by many Members of this House. It is a well known magazine and I will not name it, but it deals with many political matters, matters of the arts and matters of business. It usually has a very entertaining front cover when it comes out every month or so. During the summer it raised a question which is relevant to this legislation and I ask the Minister to raise it with the Minister for Finance. Before any tax credit is given for a donation by a person, a body or a company to one of our cultural institutions, an independent evaluation should be carried out. I read in this magazine of a case where one of our major financial institutions made such a donation and received a substantial tax credit for an item for which it had paid much more than the magazine felt it was worth. It is important that when the State automatically gives a tax credit there is a mechanism for an independent valuation, rather than have the donor describe the tax <Col N="1358" /> credit he is due. I am not being critical as the measure in the Bill is a good one, but in the interest of the tax payer I would like to know how much money is involved and I would like there to be an independent mechanism to verify that the State is getting good value. I was very pleased to see that the Minister addressed this area in her speech so maybe that information can come in due course.</P>
    <P>I am also happy to see that the Minister has elevated heritage to a level it has not attained before. The programme for Government provides for a national heritage plan and for counties and local authorities to prepare heritage plans also. The public is now much more aware of heritage as are many Government agencies that in the past were atrociously ignorant of some of these issues. It is pleasing that the Department has an agreement with the National Roads Authority whereby a consultant archaeologist must be employed on every single roads project. It is obvious the NRA had no appreciation in the past and their ignorance cost the country dearly as people had to take State agencies to European courts where they proved their cases. Eventually, after years, their projects were progressed and we all know what those projects were. I hope that will not happen again and that, with archaeologists working on these projects at an early stage, such difficulties will be avoided in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In County Laois we are blessed to have a lady called Amanda Pedlow who is the LaoisOffaly heritage officer. All counties are blessed with such officers. Recently we at Laois County Council were presented with a heritage plan for the next five years. Every local authority has commenced that process or will in the next few months. This is about bringing heritage to the people and that is why the fund of £10 million, while excellent, is only a start. In the years to come people will appreciate heritage more than they have and there will be a stronger demand for the State to involve itself directly. The aim of our heritage plan is to promote an awareness and an understanding, leading to a greater appreciation and sense of ownership of the built natural and cultural heritage of the county. Through the implementation of specific actions, the unique character of County Laois will be optimised.</P>
    <P>I know similar plans are being prepared by each local authority. The Heritage Act, 1995, defines what is natural heritage and we are very happy that we have set up our heritage forum. The national heritage plan is being prepared by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which I presume will be finalised only when all the different counties have amalgamated their local plans.</P>
    <P>The reason I am mentioning these issues is that funding will ultimately be a factor. We know at this early stage that we need a full-time heritage officer for County Laois. We also need an archivist and a conservation officer. There are some tremendous documents that are not being prop<Col N="1359" /> erly looked after. They are in old estate buildings and it is in the interest of the estates to have them conserved.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to have sat at a local authority meeting in the last few weeks and to have heard councillors discuss heritage rather that the usual issues of roads, housing, water and sewerage. A new trend is being established when 25 councillors talk about the heritage of their county &ndash; this is not how county councils have conducted their business in the past. What the Minister, through her Department, is doing is permeating through to ground level. People at ground level now understand their heritage and are keen to learn more about it, in every form, whether it is the natural or built environment, artistic artefacts, manuscripts or other such items. It is good for the country if we have a broader appreciation of these issues.</P>
    <P>I hope that in due course there will be funding available, either through the Heritage Council, the Minister's Department or the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to assist in compiling the natural heritage plan, of which the Bill we are discussing is one very important aspect.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very good. The Minister deserves credit for bringing it forward to deal with this specific issue at this time. I note that the other parties have said they will deal with it in a positive manner on Committee Stage so it will receive prompt passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was happy to attend when the Minister spoke and opened the first expansion of the National Museum of Ireland, the Museum of Country Life, at Turlough Park House in Castlebar, County Mayo. It brings to fruition the concept of bringing the heritage back to the people and allowing us to understand in a real way who exactly we are, from where we came and the implements our forefathers used. The Museum of Country Life is the first expansion of the National Museum of Ireland in over 100 years. It will prove to be an outstanding addition to the heritage of Ireland. Given that it is situated under the shadow of the round tower in Turlough, within a stone's throw of the birthplace of Michael Davitt and within sight of Croke Patrick where the memorial emigrant ship is sited, it is very fitting that the Minister was there to attend, perform her function and accord the place its high status.</P>
      <P>I feel the Bill is an important element of the jigsaw of heritage and it will undoubtedly play an important role in the years ahead in acquiring what might not now be very valuable, but which may be in time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there is a list of acquisitions internationally that we need to seek. I do not know if we have anything akin to the famous Elgin Marbles, which have been in dispute internationally for some time. There are, of course, items of Irish heritage of some considerable age in museums in America and in private museums <Col N="1360" /> in other places. We still have some of the finest Georgian facades in the world, and much of what was behind those facades was sold off and removed in one way or another by the aristocracy and those who followed them. All those artefacts must be somewhere, if not destroyed.</P>
    <P>One cannot list, say 50 items, that the fund is being set up for. In fairness to the British museums, items of heritage that they have on display serve to portray Ireland as well. It is important that international visitors to British museums see some of those very finely wrought artefacts. I understand the relationship between museums here and in Britain is very good and that if items are requested for loan, they are made available. That is good in itself.</P>
    <P>The American concept of displaying items of culture seems to be somewhat different. America's heritage physically goes back a long way, but its history is very modern. Americans tend to look upon museums as trophy rooms. Artefacts of Irish origin in many of their museums are zealously guarded. Irish and American museums do not share cultural artefacts to the same extent as Irish and British museums.</P>
    <P>The Minister's scriptwriter says: &ldquo;I was successful in acquiring this wonderful 27 page manuscript for the National Library of Ireland&rdquo;&ndash; the manuscript regarded as the centrepiece of James Joyce's masterpiece, <i>Ulysses.</i> I happened to be present the day she came back with it and I was very privileged to see it. I know she was instructed by Government. She had full Government authorisation to do her job. It is not as if she were sent out against the might of the world as a lone hit Minister to acquire it against the odds. She was working for the Irish people and the Irish Government. That is not a deep point, but in this business, one does one's job for the people. That is what she did and I share her sentiments on this aspect of the Joyce document.</P>
    <P>I have to admit that I was able to make very little headway reading <i>Ulysses </i>in my student days. I now know why &ndash; from looking at the manuscript I could not make very much sense of it. Those more learned than me will have great fun over the next 100 years trying to decipher what Joyce's thought processes were when he wrote the novel. I am glad the manuscript is on display and it proves the value of the fund in question. I cannot think of other items that are abroad that we should try to acquire. Maybe the Minister has a list of them herself &ndash; I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Bill, being non-controversial, will be passed without any great difficulty. I would like to think it forms part of an overall portrayal of the responsibilities the Minister has. The National Cultural Institutions Bill passed through the Houses in 1997. To date, it has not been implemented, which is regarded outside this House as a distinct failure of the Minister's Department. If implemented, it would give semi-State status to the National Museum of Ireland, for instance. We are going to pass this Bill, which is very good, while the provisions of the Bill <Col N="1361" /> passed more than four years ago still have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to pass a Bill to allow us acquire objects of heritage when four positions in the National Museum, including the head of collections, have not yet been filled. The Bill will be passed and the money put in place without those four positions being filled and an element of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, being implemented. The Minister should respond clearly and set out the timescale and the way she intends to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by a number of Members that there is a greater awareness of the value of our heritage and heritage objects than previously. A heritage object is defined in the Bill as an object or collection of objects, including archaeological objects and objects relating to the decorative arts, natural sciences, history, industry or folk-ways. How much further does the definition of the term &ldquo;object&rdquo; go? The Church of Ireland church in Castlebar dominates the town. It was built in 1789 and is a wonderful building. It has a very small community which is very proud of its heritage and tradition. However, because it is deemed to be a worshipping church, it is not eligible for any funding and the community is too small to raise the necessary money, despite the fact that it has been assisted by the Catholic Church and local people of all creeds and persuasions.</P>
    <P>That is something that could be examined because such buildings tend to deteriorate as they get older. They are an object of history within the meaning of the Bill. I do not suggest they should be acquired for the State, although some are, but there should be some mechanism, either through flexibility on the other end of the Minister's brief or in the European area, whereby a worshipping church can be preserved and held from continuous decay.</P>
    <P>The thought struck me that lucky Lucan's father used to cross The Mall from his house to the church in Castlebar and his name is still on the pew. I do not know if the Minister can use her office to contact the estate of the disappeared Lord Lucan to determine what element of ground rents collected still exist in that fund which might perhaps be made available for the Church of Ireland restoration fund. It might be of assistance to any flexibility the Minister might introduce in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a great range of ecclesiastical buildings, some of which are magnificent, which are heading towards decay and ruin. Various bodes, organisations, agencies and institutions, including the Heritage Council, have made a series of wonderful recommendations regarding these. I realise the Minister will soon be called before the Minister for Finance to discuss the Estimate for next year. Given the American situation and the fall-out for the world economy, the budget may not be as flúirseach, so to speak, as one might have thought six months ago. I hope the Minister bears it in mind that, because they worship actively in <Col N="1362" /> an ecclesiastical building, small though they may be in number, people who are concerned about that building and who want it preserved are prevented by legislation and conditions from drawing down assistance to do so.</P>
    <P>I listened recently to a wonderful radio documentary about the exchange of letters between an American donor and a former director of the National Museum. One of them was of the Jewish persuasion and the other was in charge of the Nazi Party in Ireland in the 1930s. It was a wonderfully presented piece of radio and it showed the wonderful attraction this country has for people from abroad. It leads me to believe that the original concept of the island of saints and scholars and the missionary zeal with which people left Ireland portrayed the name of Ireland abroad disproportionately on a world scale in that the further one travels from Ireland, the more the people focus on it.</P>
    <P>I support strongly the tax credit scheme in operation and it is worthy to promote it to those who can contribute to it. A donation of £50 million was made by an Irish businessman to the deposit account for the Superbowl. One will find that many of the directors and chief executives of the top 500 American companies are Irish or of Irish extraction. Given the volumes of money donated by Irish-Americans and American people to educational institutions, the tax credit scheme would have beneficial results by being promoted further in the United States. Arising from the recent atrocities, it is possible that people understand more clearly that they cannot take their money with them when they die and that donations to the country under the tax credit scheme would perhaps be very good as a result.</P>
    <P>I hope the motivation behind the expansion of the National Museum will be continued and that other places in Ireland will be enabled to provide viewing facilities for heritage objects that have been locked up for many years. The range, extent and value of exhibits in the Heritage Museum in St. Petersburg, such as the Kremlin Gold which people may have seen, would blow one's mind. We as a small island have a powerful tradition. Our State should be able to lead by enabling communities, local authorities and others to display exhibits at their disposal so that the people, the next generation and those who come to Ireland from abroad understand that this is an old country with an old tradition but with a modern outlook. It is the marriage between old and new that gives us that diplomatic edge in being able to deal with real people on the international stage. Our history and all that went before us is part of us and we are part of it. The Bill allows the Minister to do what is best for the country in that regard.</P>
    <P>The description of &ldquo;heritage object&rdquo; in the Bill is valid and includes any book or manuscript, the copyright on any work, which will become more important as time goes on, and similar objects or material. This gives the Minister a broad scope <Col N="1363" /> to determine whether a certain item is worthy of acquisition. Those few points are important.</P>
    <P>We know of the magnificent Father Browne collection of photographs, which is housed by one of the religious orders, and also the Lawrence collection. There is also the Wynne collection. Two centuries ago Mr. Wynne in Castlebar was a wonderful photographer. The family have informed me that thousands of negatives still exist and they portray a social history very much akin to the Lawrence collection. Department officials should contact the family to discuss and ensure the preservation and presentation of this extremely valuable collection. I have seen some of the black and white photographs but understand there are thousands of negatives.</P>
    <P>It is an important element of the overall jigsaw that the Minister should set out her implementation programme for the cultural institutions and inform us when semi-State status will be given, when the jobs in the museum will be filled and what we can do about flexibility as regards &lsquo;worshipping churches' receiving some assistance to prevent them from falling down. If the Minister does that she will have done a fine job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to a number of contributions on this Bill it is obvious there is a depth of history in every county. Over the years many artefacts and precious documents have been discovered all of which merit restoration, preservation and presentation to the public. There is an interest on a national scale that extends beyond what we are speaking about today and beyond our built heritage. The public is anxious that we do our utmost to keep what is ours and available to us in built heritage and in documents and that we present it for perusal and examination to add to our connection to and understanding of the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister is keenly aware and interested in ensuring that as much as is possible is done to keep what we have, to find out more and to continue to restore and present what we have to the public. The initiatives that have been taken by her Department are welcome. The Heritage Fund Bill, 2001 is just another piece of the jigsaw in the agenda set by the Department. I compliment the Minister on what has been achieved to date.</P>
      <P>The £10 million provision over a period of five years is just a start in the right direction. It acknowledges that something must be done to acquire and preserve the artefacts and precious historical documents that belong here. The Government should protect these and purchase them for the people. The purchase of the Joycean documents costing £1.38 million pounds was welcomed by all with an interest in that area. It is important to have the documents here available for inspection and their purchase was worthwhile. However, given the cost of those documents £10 million is small money and that is why I say it is just a start. The Minister should build on and expand that fund over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I am concerned that while we acknowledge that works exist which would be worth purchasing by the State we have not looked at what is already available throughout the country. Each of us could give examples from our constituencies. I know the mediaeval city of Kilkenny has extensive documents available to local authorities and other agencies. They are of interest to local history groups and the public and we should make some effort to restore and present these documents. There is an argument for establishing regional museums so that these documents can be presented properly.</P>
    <P>For example, the Office of Public Works is conducting a flood relief scheme in Kilkenny which involves dredging the river Nore. That project has turned up some very interesting artefacts. Along with what is already there &ndash; Kilkenny Castle and the history of Kilkenny &ndash; there is no place to present these documents. There is no fund to restore the documents and present them in a building that can be accessed by local people or anybody interested in viewing them. Some fund should be available to make it possible to present such documents. These documents are of interest. The <i>Liber Primus</i>&ndash; the minutes of Kilkenny Corporation &ndash; dates back to pre-1609. It is written in bog Latin or French of some kind and is of great interest. The <i>Statutes of Kilkenny</i> and documents handed down by King James are held in City Hall in a box. That is not good enough. Given the amount of money to which we are committing ourselves, in terms of Office of Public Works or Dúchas, some effort should be made to localise our approach to museums to enable local authorities or other interested bodies to acquire these documents and present them.</P>
    <P>People understand now that the presentation of our historical buildings and heritage is part and parcel of the attraction for tourists. They come to Kilkenny in their thousands and see Kilkenny Castle. They come back the following year wanting to explore and know more about what is happening in Kilkenny. Huge sums of money are allocated to established bodies such as Dúchas. With certain modifications and a breeze of modernisation we could bring about a different approach to how the work is done within Dúchas or the Office of Public Works. I commend all those involved for their dedication and input into the policy making process which makes the likes of Kilkenny Castle happen but we need to extend our thinking beyond that.</P>
    <P>This Bill acknowledges what is out there and creates a fund for it but we must acknowledge also what is not for sale but is currently within our ownership and yet not exposed to public view. It would be of educational benefit in terms of Irish and local history. It would also benefit our tourism business. People want to add value to their package when they arrive. They want to see not just Kilkenny Castle but other things. The history and the documents I referred to are of great interest to people. There is an argument for a Norman museum in the south-east region and for <Col N="1365" /> the artefacts found in the Dunmore caves, which are in our ownership, to be brought back and displayed locally. There is an argument for funding an appropriate building to house such artefacts and documents. When the river project is completed, all the objects found should be displayed. I have asked the Office of Public Works to fund a documentary on the project. How could a Department &ndash; and I know it is not the Minister's responsibility, but it is relevant &ndash; spend £30 million on it but not be willing to record in a film, which would be part of our history, what happened, how it was achieved and what was found? The archaeological process in that scheme has to be seen to be believed. Living in Kilkenny, I am privileged to see it unfold but it would be of value to my children to see how it was achieved. It ought to be documented and be part and parcel of what we do. We donate 1% of the budget on the construction of roads and other infrastructure to art projects. Why can we not donate some of the £30 million to making a documentary? It would not just be for the Kilkenny people but the nation, who would learn from the scheme the engineering feats and the archaeological process. That should be considered in this Bill. As the Kilkenny project is continuing, and the costs are not great, we should consider making the type of documentary of which I spoke.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise, such as documents which are not put on display. North Kilkenny and Laois have a great history of coal mining, the documents from which should be on public display. Through Leader or other funds, a building could be erected at Castlecomer where documents about coal mining could be displayed. Many Americans and Europeans are interested in this extraordinary history and will come to a place presenting the history of coal mining which was central to the local community. That is a value which should not be lost. If we do not recognise that in this Bill or another one and provide the funding, this will be lost. I witnessed teenagers watching a presentation on coal mining in Comer, organised by interested local people whose family were involved, with their mouths open. Today it is hard to believe that a few years ago their forefathers did that for a living and so helped build the local community. We must focus on this type of thing. There are collections locked away from public view, such as tapestries dating from the 17th century or earlier which are rolled up in storage. If we provide £10 million over five years, we should also provide funding in the Dúchas Estimate to provide a public display, locally, regionally or nationally, of what is stored in this building and others. This is not just part of our history but of what is happening today. We are moving so fast economically that in the next five years young people will have no understanding not just of the 17th century but the 20th and 19th centuries also because they are not exposed to the wonderful artefacts which are in storage. I am privileged as a member of Kilkenny Corporation <Col N="1366" /> and a Member of this House to have viewed some of these objects.</P>
    <P>Monuments are left to fall into disrepair, such as Tullahearne Tower or St. Mary's churchyard in Kilkenny which is a fine example of its period but its tombstones were smashed by vandals. From a public representative's point of view, this is a sin. We should be spreading the spend from the main monuments to local monuments. We are allowing a wealth of history to fall down around us, such as Cullahill Castle or Kells which is an extraordinary site visited by archaeologists from Wales exploring its Welsh connections. Why can Dúchas, as it is currently structured, not spend more on such monuments? They do much not just for our history and those studying it, but also for the many visitors from other countries. Unlike other countries, a person can walk to our monuments and touch as well as see them. I travel regularly to France where I see much of the medieval heritage restored and interaction between people. I wonder why they come from that beautiful country to Ireland. They are looking for something and we could provide it by developing our heritage.</P>
    <P>Another fine example of built heritage is the Hole in the Wall in Kilkenny which is in private ownership. That raises the issue of examining the tax code. There are tax schemes which benefit the subject matter of this Bill but we can do more to enable private owners to work on their sites or put artefacts on display. The Heritage Council or An Taisce could benefit from a tax scheme to assist private owners in restoring buildings in which owners' contributions could be offset against tax. By exploring these options, there will be returns to the State coffers through the numbers of tourists visiting both the main and local sites.</P>
    <P>Dúchas employees, who look after monuments, documents and other artefacts, and are deeply committed to restoring our built heritage and presenting artefacts to the public in the best possible way, should be consulted. Their views on how to improve the management of projects should be taken into account. They interact with heritage on our behalf daily and they do not look on it as just another day's work. I have met many officials who work daily at those sites. They are deeply committed and have an attachment to and an understanding of historical sites. They are willing to engage with people who will listen in relation to developing a structure within Dúchas which will deliver a wider and greater spend &ndash; and efficiency of spend &ndash; in terms of heritage sites and they are interested in exposing and presenting the documents and artefacts currently there. That consultation should take place.</P>
    <P>Local authorities &ndash; and I again mention Kilkenny as we are all informed by parish pump politics &ndash; have many buildings that could be used to present what has already been found. There are many artefacts that should be spread throughout the regions. Will the Minister take on board the views <Col N="1367" /> I have previously expressed by way of parliamentary question on our built heritage, and try to include a summary in the agenda so that we can achieve a greater spend and exposure of the existing sites, and the artefacts? I commend the Minister on bringing this Bill forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an attempt to do something positive for our heritage, and there is much that is important in it. There are a huge number of surviving heritage sites in Ireland that need to be preserved and managed. Interest has increased in this area in recent years due to our prosperity and the realisation that something could be done. The provision of £3 million for the first financial year and another £2 million is to be welcomed. It is important that private individuals and companies will be able to contribute to this. There is a wealth of both money and support for what is being undertaken.</P>
      <P>However, there is another side. We need to be consumer friendly in a way that many public representatives will understand. Archaeologists when visiting sites believed to be sensitive must be aware of public needs. Individuals building houses who require planning permission often encounter problems after reporting archaeological remains, something I see often in Tipperary, especially in the Cashel catchment area. Huge costs must be borne by private citizens and they find this very frustrating at times. Some feel they are being penalised and wish that they had never reported the matter. The Minister should look at this, especially if we want people to report cases of archaeological significance. I know of one case where there was a hold-up of more than six months. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I am amazed by an aspect of the Bill. I come from a part of Tipperary rich in heritage and close to where the Derrynaflan Chalice was found. There was great joy when Michael Webb and his son made that find, and pleasure that he was so magnanimous and helpful in relation to handing it over to the State. Everybody is glad that it is now in the National Museum and has been restored, but what has been done with the chalice despite that? There have been several calls for it to be located in Tipperary, where it was found. Despite general acceptance that Tipperary would be a great place to have it, and acceptance that it would benefit the local community, nothing has been done. There is no better place for it and it would be a huge tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, including local and urban authorities in Tipperary, have asked that this be done but the answer is always that there is no proper accommodation for it. I put it to the Minister that there are several suitable places; for example, the ex-cinema in Tipperary Town which is an excellent Government funded project. It would be a huge attraction if placed there. It could be put in Cashel where there is an old city hall which is a hub of activity for tourists. It would add greatly to that town. Fethard is another possibility. <Col N="1368" /> Whichever place is seen as best, there is no point leaving the chalice in Dublin, housed with many other artefacts. It loses a certain emphasis there, and there is a case for the return of the Derrynaflan chalice to Tipperary, where it was found and where it would have a major impact on the economy.</P>
    <P>Other Members have drawn attention to the rich heritage of their areas and I know the Minister is well aware of the similarly rich heritage of Tipperary. However, I will take her on a verbal trip around the county in the hope that she will in the future make funding available for particular projects. I begin with the Rock of Cashel, one of the best visitor attractions in Ireland. Everybody wants to visit the Rock of Cashel and the rich heritage in that area. There has been a suggestion that the Rock of Cashel be roofed. It may seem an outlandish idea but I suggest that a commission be set up to examine the feasibility of such a project. There is a view among specialists, though maybe not those in the Minister's Department, that if the Rock is left as it is, it will wear away. The site is open to the elements and very exposed.</P>
    <P>Funding is available from the private sector. Many commitments have been made and if there is a request for money, substantial help would be available. One of my county council colleagues, Councillor Tom Wood, who is an experienced guide at the Rock of Cashel, has been promoting this idea and has written to the Minister about it. He has received correspondence from the United States from people prepared to help the Government with funds if they consider this idea.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for this immediately. I am seeking the setting up of a commission or working group to examine the possibility of roofing the Rock. For generations to come, there is huge potential for the tourism industry. Everything in the area is based on the Rock of Cashel and on bringing people into the county. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>There are also other small important sites in Tipperary such as the 12th century Benedictine Athassel Abbey. I am sure the Minister knows its history but very few others do. However, I will not go into its history here. The roads leading to the abbey are in a bad condition and there are no parking facilities. Thomastown Castle is another fine site located five miles from Tipperary town and six miles from Cashel. It was owned by the family of Fr. Mathew, the great apostle of temperance. There is no road leading to the castle, no car park and the castle is covered in ivy. That is one of several such sites around the country that require urgent attention.</P>
    <P>As this is my first Dáil contribution on Second Stage I wanted to make it local and relevant to what the people in my constituency are saying to me. I ask the Minister to bear in mind what I have said, particularly about the smaller sites and the Rock of Cashel. Above all, the Minister should seriously consider taking the Derrynaflan Chalice out of Dublin. Many other artefacts could also <Col N="1369" /> be located in areas outside this city. We need to explore this avenue for the benefit of people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Five institutions, all Dublin-based, will benefit from the Bill. As this city is chock-a-block with people and traffic, small towns should benefit from the provisions of the Bill. This would promote decentralisation and get tourists out of the cities and into the country.</P>
    <P>We have a lot going for us in Tipperary and I hope the Minister will look favourably at giving us some money in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which honours the Government's commitment as contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The Bill provides for the establishment of a fund for the State to purchase items for our national collections. I understand the main purpose of this fund will be to build up resources which will be used only by the principal State collecting institutions.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge the many great artefacts that have been contributed &ndash; many free of charge, and some purchased &ndash; to our national collections to date. I pay tribute to all involved in the tremendous heritage collections in our State institutions that have been collected without any dedicated heritage fund. It is important that we acknowledge the personnel at different levels who have identified when the State should intervene to acquire an artefact. The other side of that coin is the owners of artefacts who have contributed free of charge.</P>
      <P>The Minister is putting in place a solid foundation to ensure any artefacts, including archaeological items, manuscripts, printed books and works of art that, as defined under the Bill, are of national importance can be acquired with this fund which otherwise would not be possible within normal budget constraints. I appreciate the structure the Minister has included in section 7 for the five eligible institutions that will utilise the heritage fund. In her Second Stage contribution, the Minister indicated the stipulations that will be in place when a heritage object is being acquired, that it must be through what she deems an appropriate procedure by the relevant eligible institution, by the director or the chief executive officer of that institution. She further states that the council of the national cultural institutions will ultimately decide before it makes a recommendation to the Minister if the proposed acquisition is an outstanding example of its type and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and her officials realise from the debate so far that many of us welcome the work that has been done. I do not think I have heard anybody dissociate themselves from the setting up of this fund, but people are concerned that in the past when such an artefact was acquired we heard little about it but after the purchase one might question the procedure that is in place to ensure the object is displayed in an appropriate and customer-friendly location. Per<Col N="1370" /> haps the Minister can put in place a structure to that end. I am not sure if it can be included in an amendment to section 7 or some other section the Minister may deem appropriate, but it would be helpful if she could incorporate an acceptable procedure or protocol because of the large amount of money involved. If this is to be utilised properly surely, in the purchase of important national resources, we must be satisfied that there is a transparent structure in place to ensure these artefacts will be on display.</P>
    <P>I do not have any great ideas for the Minister to resolve some of the issues that have been brought to her attention during the debate. I compliment Deputy Tom Hayes on the content of his maiden speech and congratulate him on his election to the House. I wish him well. I can relate to what he said in regard to issues of geographic location. Is there a transparent protocol or structure in place to ensure an artefact associated with a community or region is displayed and associated with that region? I earnestly ask the Minister to look favourably at ensuring that an appropriate open and transparent protocol would be put in place. I have no doubt the institutions would be happy to work with the Minister to ensure such a protocol is amicably agreed by all concerned. Perhaps something can be agreed on Committee or Report Stage. I gather from the various contributions of Members that agreement could be reached easily enough on this matter.</P>
    <P>On a regional basis the fund could have considerable implications for cultural tourism as acquisitions will provide an added attraction in encouraging overseas visitors to Ireland. That is on the understanding that such artefacts will be displayed on a regional basis. Acquisitions will also be significant from an educational and research point of view. This is a subject which is not adequately provided for by statute in the school curriculum. I welcome many of the changes in the educational sector in recent years particularly in regard to CSPE. Given that many of us have witnessed apathy and the lack of understanding, the inclusion of CSPE in the school curriculum has already proved to be beneficial. Perhaps there is scope to develop it further in the primary, secondary and third level areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the provisions in the Heritage Fund Bill are separate from but complementary to the provisions in the scheme for tax relief for donation of heritage objects as provided under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The Minister will be aware I have tabled many questions on the tax relief aspect and on the listing of objects and she will be aware of my strongly held views on this matter. I ask the Minister to avail of the opportunity to ensure our artefacts are appropriately recorded, listed and available to the various institutions and other interest groups.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues from the heritage city of Dublin I am proud that much work has been done within the medieval area and the <Col N="1371" /> Viking area. In my constituency I am happy to be associated with the famous Marino Casino. I thank and congratulate the Minister for the allocations provided to enable the required works to be undertaken at Marino Casino. Following my representations the Minister kindly allocated the required funding. I record my appreciation and that of the wider community in the Dublin North constituency who welcome the allocation.</P>
    <P>We welcome the structures which the Bill will put in place and the moneys that will be allocated. I hope these allocations will be increased in the years ahead. I ask the Minister to review the position in regard to the display and location of artefacts.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to see Deputy Keaveney take the Chair, following in the footsteps of many famous Donegal people in the past, such as the late Cormac Breslin and the late Joe Brennan, very eminent chairmen in this House. Perhaps the Deputy will succeed them eventually. They are running the Deputy. Deputy McGinley obviously thinks he may get the slot before Deputy Keaveney.</P>
      <P>I was surprised Deputy Callely did not seek a large amount of money for the reconstruction and development of the site of the Battle of Clontarf in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is all about our heritage. If the constituency boundaries are changed the Deputy may well end up where the actual site is based. As a matter of interest perhaps the Minister would tell the House what is being done to preserve the site of the Battle of Clontarf. I had not known it was reconstituted and that we know the exact location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on any Bill which refers to heritage and our history but I have the reservation that I find it an elitist Bill as is so much of the legislation we deal with here regarding the arts and heritage. The projects or the objects it deals with cannot be valued at less than £250,000 so that it is restrictive in that regard. I can see the objective of the Bill in wishing to fund major items of historical interest, whether fixed structures, manuscripts or artefacts but it is limited because of its elitist nature. That the Council of National Cultural Institutions consists of ten different bodies makes it elitist because we are dealing with the upper echelons of the &ldquo;arty&rdquo; types. I am sure Senator David Norris will be delighted with the Minister's dissertation about the acquisition of the &ldquo;Circe&rdquo; manuscript, which we saw in the media. There are so <Col N="1372" /> many facets of heritage here which are ignored, and so much of it is concentrated in and around Dublin, that many of us are very cynical when it comes to legislation dealing with heritage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, 7, 9 to 16, inclusive, 18, 19, 21, 23 to 27, inclusive, and 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The possible withdrawal of the Unionist parties from the Executive following Monday's votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly clearly represents a most serious threat to the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement. The two Governments will obviously continue in their efforts but at this testing time I urge the maximum flexibility on all sides and the use to the fullest of all the time available, which clearly is narrowing.</P>
      <P>It is vital that confidence and momentum be restored if we are to get the process back on track. That means moving forward on all of the outstanding elements of the Agreement as set out by the Governments following the discussions at Weston Park. It means ensuring that the question of arms is progressed and all parties working to ensure the full and stable operation, on an inclusive basis, of all of the institutions created under the Agreement.</P>
      <P>In the course of our discussions with the political parties at Weston Park in July, considerable progress was made on the outstanding issues in relation to policing, the stability of the institutions, security normalisation and decommissioning. Our objective was to put together a comprehensive package that would achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We put that package to the parties on 1 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of significant developments since then and it continues to be the aim of both Governments to bring about the full implementation of the Agreement. A new beginning in policing is a central dimension of the Agreement. The decision in mid-August by the <Col N="1375" /> SDLP to make nominations to the new police board and the district policing partnerships was clearly an important step by that party and one which the Government welcomed. I also welcome the decision by Unionist parties to nominate members to these bodies. The chairman and vice-chairman of the board, Professor Desmond Rea and Denis Bradley, working together, have a pivotal role in directing the work of the board in its crucial start-up period when many key issues will have to be addressed. I hope Sinn Féin will in time also find it possible to participate and contribute to this new beginning in policing.</P>
    <P>Putting arms beyond use is an indispensable part of implementing the Agreement. The agreement of a scheme for putting arms beyond use was confirmed in the IRA statement of 8 August. I was naturally disappointed by its later statement of 14 August, when this offer was withdrawn. The more recent statement by the IRA of 19 September confirmed that the IRA would intensify engagement with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) with a view to accelerating progress towards a comprehensive resolution of the arms issue. This statement is an indication of renewed progress and a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Over the summer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have been actively engaged in seeking to move the process forward. I met bilaterally the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, most recently in Downing Street on 19 September and in the margins of the special EU summit in Brussels on 21 September, and with the leaders of the pro-Agreement parties. I also maintain frequent telephone contact with them, including with the Prime Minister on Monday last. I had the opportunity to meet the Sinn Féin President, Mr. Gerry Adams, yesterday. I will meet a deputation from the SDLP later this afternoon. On Tuesday, 2 October, I had a very useful meeting with Mr. David Trimble who was accompanied by Acting First Minister Sir Reg Empey. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also kept in touch with the pro-Agreement parties and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, and met with him on 11 August in Belfast to discuss the restoration of the devolved government in Northern Ireland and also on 21 September in Brussels, following the expiry of the six week period and the further suspension which was announced earlier that day. The Executive and the Assembly were subsequently restored for an additional six weeks.</P>
    <P>All these discussions were focused on advancing progress on the outstanding issues. The situation is obviously difficult and we are all very mindful that time is pressing. We, and all the parties that support the Agreement, must continue our efforts to find a way forward. I urge everyone to avail of the limited time now available and not lose sight of the considerable progress that has been made in recent years. If we can work our way through the current impasse we can continue to build on this progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Among the issues which I discussed with Mr. David Trimble was the motion tabled by the UUP proposing the exclusion of Sinn Féin from the Executive. From the very beginning of this process, the Government considered that a crucial strength of the process was its inclusiveness. We continue to take the view that any departure from that risks serious damage to the process as does any failure to fully implement the various elements of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In my contacts with Sinn Féin, I raised our concerns regarding events in Colombia and their effect on confidence in the process. The Department of Foreign Affairs' consular service is maintaining contact with the people concerned and their representatives.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible terms the vicious and cold blooded murder of Martin O'Hagan on Friday, 28 September and to offer my deepest sympathy to Martin's family and his colleagues at the <i>Sunday World.</i> Press freedom is a cornerstone of a free and democratic society. Investigative journalists like Martin serve the people and the democratic process by fearlessly investigating and impartially reporting on events and situations, without fear or favour to any person or party. The evil people who seek to serve their own agenda by the use of violence and intimidation must be stopped and they must not be allowed to deflect the will of the people for a peaceful society.</P>
    <P>I also condemn the recent violence in north Belfast and the ongoing protest at Holy Cross school, Ardoyne. I call on all public representatives and church leaders, particularly at local level, to ensure that tensions are lessened and that inter-community dialogue takes place in a calm and reasonable way. No community's interests are served by violence and no one should be led down the cul-de-sac of sectarianism and violence.</P>
    <P>I met Ambassador Richard Haass on Tuesday, 11 September. As the meeting was about to commence, we learned of the terrible events that were happening in the United States. Naturally, while we focused on matters relating to Northern Ireland, our discussion was largely devoted to the attacks on the United States.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my own and the Government's deep appreciation to the leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, for all of his magnificent public service. It was with a sense of sadness that I learned of his decision to step down as leader of the SDLP. For more than 30 years John has laboured tirelessly in the search for lasting peace on this island. Throughout difficult, dark days he did not falter in his insistence that dialogue was the only way forward and he did not tire in his efforts to persuade others to come around the table. While the award of the Nobel Peace prize was a fitting recognition of his commitment to the achievement of lasting peace, an even greater recognition of his contribution is the esteem and affection in which he is held by the people of Ireland. To John and his wife, Pat, <Col N="1377" /> I extend our deepest gratitude for the many years of tireless, selfless endeavour.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute too, to Seamus Mallon, who announced his decision to step down as Deputy Leader of the SDLP. Seamus has also played a central role in the political life of Northern Ireland over many years.</P>
    <P>In his role as Deputy First Minister he has worked and will continue to work tirelessly for all the people of Northern Ireland. He played a pivotal role in the work which is leading to the achievement of a new police service for Northern Ireland.</P>

    <P>Regarding the Deputy's question, it is too early to say. The tone of Monday's meeting in terms of Northern Ireland debates was not as bad as it could have been, and many useful things were said in the course of it. The extension in time, <Col N="1378" /> while only a matter of days, is clearly helpful. However, it is too early to say if that will assist the situation. There have been useful dialogue and meetings, but I cannot report that anything substantive is about to happen which will solve the problem. We have to maintain our efforts. The tone of the debate over the past week or ten days has moderated to a more helpful level which may allow us to have a more reasoned debate, and I am thankful for that.</P>

      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave a formal role to the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals about matters in Northern Ireland and which put an obligation on the British Government to deal with those views and proposals, no longer applies. In a worst case scenario and if the Good Friday Agreement collapses, is it the policy of the Government to negotiate a new formal arrangement with the British Government so Governments in this jurisdiction may continue to put forward views and proposals to which the British Government would be statutorily obliged to listen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>There is no question but that the old bunker and fortress arrangement which previously operated has been replaced by a more civilised and useful arrangement which is accepted by all sides. However, it has not changed our involvement. The British Government totally accepts the position of us communicating our views and of them communicating their decisions for discussion. Satisfactory replies are not always received, but it operates effectively and I see no change being made to that position. Mutual trust has been built up over a long number of years which effectively means any new proposals brought forward by the British Government or any appointments they make are communicated to the Irish Government giving us an opportunity to express a considered opinion. I do not think that will change regardless of what happens.</P>

      <P>In the discussions he has had recently with the republican leadership arising from the expectation following the Weston Park meeting, and in view of what he has just said, namely, that to all intents and purposes the Provisional IRA is alive and well in this jurisdiction, albeit at a lower level of activity, does the Taoiseach think they will ever decommission? Have we all been fooling ourselves? Has this just been a charade, given they are maintaining an organisation on a semi-active footing on one hand and on the other are refusing to give effect to the clear understanding we have? After the Weston Park discussions with the republican leadership, specifically Gerry Adams, his deputy leader,</P>
      <P>Martin McGuinness, and others, does the Taoiseach agree that all we have had are weasel words and that in reality we will never have decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions. My clear understanding after the meeting in Weston Park was that we were going to have progress on a number of fronts, namely, the stability of the institutions, policing and decommissioning. In the first week of August it seemed as if what we all described as an historical move forward would occur within a relatively short period, and the fact it did not happen was a disappointment. The republican movement and the leadership of Sinn Féin have explained that the issues were taken off the agenda because of the negative reaction of the British Government and the UUP which did not embrace their statements or actions. More positively, the speech by the President of Sinn Féin last week acknowledged that since 11 September the world is a different place and that national and international opinion has changed. He has also emphasised that terrorism, violence or paramilitarism are not compatible. That is a significant statement. Over the past number of years we have also seen the Sinn Féin leadership endeavour to move those who would be associated with them away from a campaign of violence. We have had a number of years of more peaceful times even if there have been breakaways from that.</P>
      <P>However, there are still difficulties, including that which occurred over the summer. There are issues relating to the republican movement and what people thought would happen after the Weston Park meeting. An enormous amount of time and effort went into that meeting and I continue to bore people by saying that it was not just the week we spent in Weston Park, but it was a process which began on 11 January. From that date to 1 August is a long period in anyone's life and considerable effort was put into it only to see it fritter away over a few hours. However, that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still believe that point is still where it has to be picked up. That process set down clearly what everybody has to do in all areas. As I have previously said to the House, I cannot think of any better resolutions than those we have set down. <Col N="1380" /> We are now dealing with the stability of the institutions. We set down precisely how we believe the stability of the institutions should be dealt with. We set down how we believed the issue of policing would be dealt with and even though it has not moved on fully, it has moved on substantially. We set down where we thought demilitarisation would go and what should happen on decommissioning. The two Governments are working with the parties to that.</P>
    <P>Since then we have had the terrible difficulties in the Ardoyne, intimidation of young children, attacks on Catholics' homes and the extension of violence by the UDA and other paramilitary elements. Any killing is one too many, but there could have been even more. There has been an escalation of violence on the streets. The ferocity of the sectarian violence over the past few weeks has been quite horrific because we are not making progress on the political front.</P>
    <P>There are so many other good initiatives. On the North-South bodies we have had things like Coolkeeragh, the road network between Dublin and Belfast and issues relating to gas as well as enterprise and trade issues being dealt with by the Tánaiste and Sir Reg Empey. A number of positive things have continued right up to now. To jeopardise all of that by not moving on does not make any political sense especially for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should look at how far we have moved rather than issues that have not been addressed. That is what the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, along with my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I have been painfully trying to explain every day to the various parties and delegations that we meet. However, we cannot do that unless the process gets the impetus it requires. Everybody knows what is required to inject life into the process &ndash; it is hardly necessary for me to outline it. If there is not life in it, then there will be violence, negative reactions and people on the streets. We cannot point to violence coming from just one area. The intimidation of the children going to the Holy Cross school in Ardoyne or any of the other acts are bad for everybody. Trying to blame one group or another will get us nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his recent meetings with the British Prime Minister did the Taoiseach raise the issue of sectarian attacks by loyalist paramilitaries, particularly in Belfast? There have been in excess of 150 pipe bombings, attacks on people's homes, murders and attempted murders. Has he received a security briefing revealing the view of the security forces in Northern Ireland about whether this campaign will continue? What are the grounds for the statement he has just made that these attacks are simply filling a vacuum left by the lack of political progress and if there were political progress these attacks would cease? Is there not equal evidence that if there were political progress not alone might these <Col N="1381" /> attacks continue, but they might even increase? Can the Taoiseach share the information he may have with the House? These matters are of great concern to many people in this jurisdiction and their frequency and virulence are beginning to undermine the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence shows they are contrived and organised on a very sophisticated level. When strong efforts were made by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and me to ask the Secretary of State, John Reid, to act, this led to the almost total cessation of the acts on Friday, 28 September, when he issued a warning to the UDA. Up to then there was speculation that splinter groups were involved but this changed when he made it clear he would declare that the UDA was no longer on ceasefire. The change in the position was evident overnight. He also said that daily monitoring is desirable so that there will not be a drifting back, but the ferocity of activity, most notably in north Belfast and the Ardoyne school shows how vicious people can be in orchestrating the intimidation of young children and their parents, mainly mothers, on the way to school every day.</P>
      <P>Over the past six or seven years, violence has been linked to periods when there was a political vacuum. There are people involved in criminal activity and people who do not want to see any political progress &ndash; I believe this is what Deputy Noonan was alluding to. These people fear that political progress would affect their illegal activities. However the turning on of paramilitary activity is different.</P>

      <P>In light of the Taoiseach's comments regarding the excellent contribution made by both John Hume and Seamus Mallon &ndash; not to mention Sean Neeson, but particularly the SDLP leader and deputy leader, one of the most courageous things they did, prior to the announcement of their retirement, was to recommend that Nationalists in Northern Ireland join the new Police Service of Northern Ireland. This is a key element in making an acceptable society a reality for all in Northern Ireland, including those suffering from sectarian hatred. Has the Taoiseach anything to say about the comments attributed to the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, that Nationalists of the republican movement would extend to the new police service the same treatment that they had extended to the RUC? This is a chilling reminder of the number of RUC members killed by the Provisional IRA in previous times. Has he raised this matter with the republican leadership in recent times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, and it is well known that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree entirely with Sinn Féin's view on policing. It is clear it equally disagrees with mine. However, if we look back on this issue, policing could not be resolved in the six months run up to the Good Friday Agreement. We agreed that we would <Col N="1382" /> need to get an independent body to look at the issue. Regardless of what was said about the chairman of that body, Chris Patten, when he was appointed &ndash; there is a report on the record of the House to the effect that we were not consulted about that &ndash; he did a very fine job. We had an input in regard to many of the individuals involved and they got together an outstanding team that worked from just a few months after the Good Friday Agreement right up until September 1999. Many eminent people were on that body. They travelled throughout the North, held public sessions, met the political parties and met the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>It was generally believed when it issued a report in September 1999 that it was a balanced report. We then moved on to try to get full implementation on that. We had difficulties with the Secretary of State, Peter Mandelson, on that issue because he rowed back from what was in the</P>
    <P>Patten report. We took a strongly pro-Nationalist line on that because the understanding was that the Patten report would be implemented in full; I know all parties in the House took a similar view on that. We then engaged in a protracted 12 month period when the legislation went through up until the summer of 2000 when we differed with the British Government.</P>
    <P>Last autumn we started to go back through the sections on which we believed there were differences or disagreements. I am not saying we solved every issue but the implementation plan for policing, which we then came to, was a major step. We passionately believe that we covered as many issues as was reasonably possible. We got a commitment that the oversight commissioner would carry out a review over this winter, and we got an agreement that the British Government would bring forward a further Bill to deal with these issues. While the policing board and the district policing committees would perhaps like all of these things to be in place now, at least an agreement was reached. I take that as a solemn agreement that the British Government will not break because the details of it are written down, and the obvious thing to do is move on. It will take about another year, perhaps even to the end of next year, for the review by Tom Considine and the legislation to be passed but at that stage we will be back to where we wanted to go originally. Rather than wait until then, however, it is better that we move on, so I fully agree with the Deputy's comment that the SDLP did the right thing. It was a brave thing to do. It is always easier to sit on the fence and not make a decision but the SDLP was brave to move forward. With the new chairman and vice-chairman, I believe we can make progress on policing.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's last point is the most important one. Do not the events of every summer, but particularly the events of September, show that when we have a cross community policing service, everybody feels safer and we move away from the past? I would like to be able to say to any of the parties in the House that we can change all this <Col N="1383" /> in three months, but that is a nonsense. It is impossible. We are trying to change something that has existed for 70 or 80 years but we now have a blueprint to do that, and it is far better that the people who want to see that change are on the inside trying to direct it. The sad event of last week is that by Sinn Féin not taking up its seats it has given those seats to Unionist members. That is not a good idea but on a constructive note from Sinn Féin's point of view, I hope it will realise in time that we have achieved a great deal and that it will join in this process because that appears to be the logical thing to do.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall the letter from Mr. David Trimble to the members of the Ulster Unionist Council almost 12 months ago, 26 October 2000? In that letter, Mr. Trimble outlined his strategy to increase pressure on republicans and Nationalists progressively to place responsibility on republicans and &ldquo;only that way can suspension be achieved&rdquo;? Surely what we have now is the out-working of this Unionist strategy for suspension of the Good Friday institutions. What is the Taoiseach's view and the response of the Government to Mr. Trimble's statement to his colleagues 12 months ago? Also, does the Taoiseach not agree it is time the British Government ceased pandering to the Unionist veto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is contained in the judicial findings of both the High Court and the Supreme Court in Northern Ireland. They have said that what Mr. David Trimble did on that occasion was wrong. We said that from the start and we all agreed with it. Trying to undermine the institutions or operate vetoes in them is clearly unhelpful and the legal process has answered that question. As we go forward, that ruling is now there. I remember well the morning that happened. It was the last Saturday in October. The Deputy and I will remember the reason Mr. David Trimble played that card on that morning, and I do not need to say any more. I disagreed with it but, in fairness, he is not here to answer. I remember why he did it.</P>

      <P>Real and substantive progress will continue to be made on all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. That is the commitment of my party, but recognising that all of us have obligations to ensure the Agreement is fully implemented, does the Taoiseach agree that the difficulties that have to be resolved can best be resolved within the institutions? In his meeting with Mr. David Trimble last week, did the Taoiseach ask him to withdraw his threat to pull down the executive and effectively collapse the institutions, which he is now doing? Will he share that information with us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was the purpose of practically the entire meeting. The Irish Govern<Col N="1384" /> ment believes that it is only by an inclusive arrangement that we will ever make progress. That requires that decisions be made within the institutions. The institutions should try to carry out the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all respects. Taking a very broad approach to all of the issues raised is the only way forward. That means that the executive, the Assembly and the North-South bodies have to work effectively as well as the other arrangements that involve us on the interparliamentary tiers, both between here and Westminster and the Council of the Isles. That is the way forward. For that to happen effectively, however, we have to get a clear understanding, as outlined by the two Governments on 1 August, of what needs to be done and then remove the obstacles to those issues. Otherwise we will go around in circles until we crash into each other, and crash into the institutions, before we resolve these issues. Unfortunately, the agenda will not change. There are outstanding issues that have to be dealt with and neither the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, me or anybody else &ndash; I always appreciate the support of this House &ndash; can resolve those matters until the issues that are obvious and understood by everyone are dealt with. Only then can we move forward.</P>

        <b>: </b>I also condemn the brutal murder of Martin O'Hagan and other innocent victims shot by reactionary sectarians in the past months. I have criticised the structures set up under the Good Friday Agreement on many occasions for institutionalising sectarian division. It appears to be the case that the main parties, which are based on one side or other of the sectarian divide, are showing themselves to be increasingly incapable of bringing the situation forward and bridging the gap which, according to those who established them, the institutions negotiated under the Good Friday Agreement were supposed to do. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is an increasing and alarming separation of communities and territories along sectarian lines throughout the North and not only in north Belfast, and that this is a very dangerous development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling and reactionary events in Ardoyne, involving the intimidation of schoolchildren, is condemned by all, as are the pipe bomb attacks by loyalists. Does the Taoiseach agree that, unfortunately, intimidation and sectarianism are not only a one-way process and that many Protestants also feel intimidated in certain areas? In view of this, does he agree that a new movement among communities is required to try and establish some form of people power? The majority of people do not want what is happening where, however many constitute a minority, sectarian bigots are allowed to have the upper hand? Does he agree that a new movement of communities, including workers and their trade unions, which fortunately still remain united, is needed to mobilise people and sweep aside the increasing <Col N="1385" /> grip of the sectarian bigots on both sides and thereby avoid the danger of the North sliding into a Bosnia type situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusually I agree with much of what the Deputy has said. If the institutions are working well the public, whom they serve, will see the advantage, especially if every day issues are progressing and if there is confidence and trust that they will be resolved. This will happen even where people may be critical, as they are in the case of our institutions or any other parliament. From talking to those involved in agriculture in the North, I am aware how pleased they are that agriculture committees, involving Sinn Fein and other parties, have been chaired by Dr. Paisley, without fear or favour and in a fair way. It may be difficult for Sinn Féin and DUP representatives but Dr. Paisley is working very well with all parties.</P>
      <P>When the institutions do not work well people become involved in the difficulties. We know why the situation in Ardoyne arose; it did not appear out of the blue. It arose because the Glenbryn Estate, which is adjacent to it, contains new residents who left the Shankill last year because of the difficulties arising from the feud among loyalists. They find it difficult to operate in a community that contains a Catholic school. That is the underlying problem. They have never had to live with this and it is very difficult for them.</P>
      <P>The problem exists on both sides of the divide. Protestants are being intimidated out of Catholic areas and <i>vice versa.</i> It depends on where the line is drawn. None of us is foolish enough to believe this will be resolved overnight but if people believe that the normal democratic, policing and community structures are in place and working, including the involvement of the Civic Forum, change will take place. Only structures of that kind will move people on. In this process there is also room for the involvement of trade Unionists and others but I do not see that successfully happening if the main democratic structures, involving people in positions of influence, are not working. A close analysis of divisions along religious, ethnic and race lines in the North or elsewhere shows this to be the case. A fair and democratic structure must be seen to be working. That is the issue that must be quickly resolved, otherwise we will be in a worse position.</P>

While there is some hope at present, let us hope that if there is movement it will be meaningful and will not be dictated by temporary arrangements. Would the Taoiseach further agree that while it is a colossal disappointment that Sinn Féin has not even agreed to ask its supporters to take up their positions on the policing board, the reality is that there was never any hope of that happening and that remains the position? Let us hope it changes in the future but let us recognise the current reality and not fool ourselves.</P>

      <P>It is almost three and a half years since the people, North and South, ratified, by way of referendum, the Good Friday Agreement. With regard to the holding of illegal arms in this jurisdiction, is a Garda unit actively pursuing the discovery or uncovering of arms dumps or has it been disbanded? Recent intelligence reports indicate the existence of significant arms caches and dumps throughout this jurisdiction, especially in my constituency. Will the Taoiseach <Col N="1387" /> confirm that the Garda is in active daily pursuit of the location of these dumps with a view to bringing those responsible to justice immediately?</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Currie's question, the issue of decommissioning is the central one. It is not, in fairness, the only issue. Many others were mentioned and the Supreme Court decision is one of them. That which relates to the policing issue was perhaps inevitable but it does not make much sense. The reality is that if there is to be a major change and if there is to be a move away from punishment beatings, community beatings and vigilante activities, the way forward is to have a police service which everybody can support and respect. After the legislation is introduced, after the implementation body's report and after Professor Tom Considine's review, the grounds for Sinn Féin's concerns will be removed. Even if it is a year on, it is logical for Sinn Féin to move.</P>

All gardaí, all of the time, including the special task force, are continually involved in the search for illegally held arms.

      <P>Many of the world's leading high-technology companies are experiencing stagnant or falling market demand and have had to retrench their operations worldwide. The Irish operations of the global ICT companies experiencing job losses or closures attribute their difficulties to global factors and not to problems inherent in the Irish economy. They state the causes principally to be loss of sales for their particular product, European and world downturn in the global ICT industry, increasing global competitiveness or over-capacity due to the buoyancy of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> The Government's strategy is to focus intensely on ensuring Ireland remains an attractive location for the ICT sector. This will help to mitigate the worst effects of the downturn and ensure that we are well placed to benefit from the undoubted long-term growth potential of the sector. Key actions include implementing the NDP on schedule, particularly the roll out of infrastructure into the regions, and maintaining the competitiveness of the economy by controlling wage and price inflation. We must also enhance our skills base by continuing to invest in education and training and by promoting an increase in research and development activity through initiatives such as Science Foundation Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put to the Minister the importance of having an audit of skills within the industry. Does she agree it is of fundamental importance to be able to contrast jobs and job losses between urban and rural areas and between those engaged in skilled and unskilled labour? There is a world of difference between job losses at a high-skills plant in Dublin, of which we have had a number recently, and the loss of jobs at a plant like that in Macroom in County Cork where the workforce is largely unskilled. Does the Minister have such an audit at her disposal? If so, what plan is there to prioritise unskilled workers who lose their jobs and workers who lose their jobs in rural, isolated areas where there is less choice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that there is a major difference between the loss of high-tech employment and the loss of low-skilled employment for a host of reasons. In the first instance, a person with a high level of skill is far more employable and we have seen that in recent times where, notwithstanding the difficulties, workers have moved from one employer to another in a matter of days. I agree with him that there is clearly a major difference between more peripheral regions, where things are more difficult, and larger urban areas. Despite those difficulties it is a fact that employment in the economy remains buoyant. The number of applications for work permits continues to be very high, much of it in the low skills area where employers are finding it difficult to recruit locally. In the context of General Semiconductors in Macroom, a number of workers have already been placed in alternative employment, some at Kostal in Mallow, which I opened last Saturday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that it is important to have a mechanism in place, and we <Col N="1389" /> do. As a matter of course when a company announces it is going to close or make people redundant FÁS makes contact with that company. It offers advice and the possibility of on-site training or training nearby if it is a peripheral location or at a local training centre. That is working extremely well. In Donegal in recent years many former Fruit of the Loom workers have now been trained in computer skills and have found new employment. Equally, in the case of the workers in Macroom &ndash; and in the case of the workers in Tallaght who may be about to lose their jobs &ndash; FÁS has the capacity to offer re-training and up-skilling with a view to helping people find alternative employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The most effective way to ensure the euro does not lead to an increase in prices is to empower consumers to monitor prices. To do this consumers need to be able to compare prices between Irish pounds and euros through exposure to dual pricing. That is the objective of the national code of practice on dual display of prices, which was drawn up in conjunction with the Director of Consumer Affairs. By the commencement date on 1 October last, large numbers of organisations had already signed up to either the national code or to sectoral codes which have been approved under it by the Director of Consumer Affairs. This shows that businesses generally are anxious to carry out the changeover fairly and to be seen to do so. They want to retain their customers' confidence now, throughout the changeover and long after it is over. It is vitally important that consumers realise the power that they themselves have in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate sanction for any trader who seeks to take advantage of the changeover is loss of business. Should it happen that consumers think they are not being treated fairly and do not get satisfaction when they make a complaint, they will be entitled to take up the matter with the <Col N="1390" /> Director of Consumer Affairs. The director will publicly name and shame any trader who displays the logo associated with adherence to the national code, or to the approved sectoral codes, but fails to live up to the commitments involved. A concrete example of the power of negative publicity was provided last month when, as a result of a consumer outcry and concerns expressed by myself and the director, a certain company cancelled its plans to replace its one-pint carton of milk with a half-litre carton. I had been in direct contact with the company following its original announcement and I subsequently welcomed the company's decision to honour its commitments in relation to the euro.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the Director of Consumer Affairs, and for myself, the priority is to ensure that the action taken on dual display of prices, as well as the informational activities under way and envisaged by the director, will maximise the likelihood that the changeover to the euro will prove a positive experience overall for the country and its citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State acknowledge that some businesses and retailers have used the prospect of changeover day to round up prices now? Prices are being rounded up now, not on 1 January or 30 December. Does the Minister of State acknowledge that the case he mentioned, Glanbia, is by no means isolated? The problem is that there are no effective sanctions for any retailer or business that wants to engage in excessive profit taking and who sees the conversion to the euro as an opportunity to do that. The Minister did not address the point in my question about whether he would consider a temporary price freeze until consumers become accustomed to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The example mentioned by the Deputy is obviously a company that made a serious error. We have a very open competitive marketplace. We have not used price control for some time on a long-term basis, as the Deputy will be aware from his involvement as a Minister. Certainly, my approach and that of the Director of Consumer Affairs is one of giving companies the chance to use this changeover to seek competitive advantage and to treat their consumers well. The code of practice does that. It gives companies the opportunity to show they can be fair and will not cheat the consumers.</P>
      <P>The list of retailers and businesses that have signed on is very impressive. In the grocery business, all the big multiple stores have signed on and they constitute about 90% of the grocery trade. Newspaper, cigarette and magazine outlets, DIY stores, etc., are all included in the list of those who have subscribed. Any Deputy who wishes to see the list can get it from the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach is one of putting pressure on businesses so they will behave properly. I agree with the Deputy in thinking that if any business <Col N="1391" /> endeavours to use the changeover, which is exciting and should be a positive experience, to gain advantage, it should be exposed. We will be very vigilant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about price control. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly consider any options open to me. My approach to date, and that of the Government, has been one of encouraging businesses and retailers to behave properly. The vast majority of them are doing that. I have outlined the measures the Director of Consumer Affairs can take if somebody signs on for the logo and then does not honour the commitments required of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister just said the vast majority of companies are behaving in accordance with the established code. How does he know that? Can he outline exactly what inspections or procedures are in place to check on prices?</P>
      <P>To date, I have heard anecdotes about prices being raised so that when the changeover takes place, they will be in nice even numbers. Also, I have heard of prices being rounded off. The Minister said that if consumers are concerned, they could make their concerns known to the Director of Consumer Affairs. Are we depending on the consumer to alert the Director of Consumer Affairs or has she additional funding to increase her numbers of inspectors? That is very important at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is conducting price surveys at present and will be reporting back to me. She has been given increased resources by my Department. Additional inspectors were employed during the temporary price freeze on drink prices last year. Those inspectors are still working with the director and they will clearly be working around the clock in the coming months&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an indication of how many additional inspectors there are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the number has increased to about 20, but I will check it and give Deputy Clune the precise number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 20 from how many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there might be six or seven additional inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that nationwide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Again, it is important that the consumer, as in any other area of employment law where there are legal breaches, is very powerful and can complain. We cannot have a police person in every corner shop examining prices. When I mentioned companies acting properly, I think we are all aware of retailers and grocery outlets that are using the euro changeover in a <Col N="1392" /> positive way and giving their customers additional information and ensuring prices are properly displayed.</P>
      <P>The code also obliges retailers to ensure the position of elderly people is catered for, and that of the visually impaired. The pressure and focus is on the retailers. They have to perform.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clune has good business experience and knows that it is a matter of competition. The number of retailers who have signed up to the code is impressive. There are still others who have still to sign on and I encourage them to do so. Those who have signed on have made a commitment, and if they do not honour it they will be exposed. To this end, the consumer is all-powerful because, even though we have increased the number of inspectors, this increase would not be adequate without their involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only conclude that the Minister of State does not do very much shopping himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I shop regularly in Ballinteer, probably as much as Deputy Rabbitte, if not more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess it would be very easy to do more than I do. What the Minister of State said does not reflect the reality of the spate of price increases that has taken place. I have recently been approached by shop workers who tell me that it is known that some of the leading stores in town have been rounding up prices for the last two months in anticipation of the fact that they will not be able to do it on changeover day.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is telling the House that the voluntary code will address the problem. The code is entirely voluntary. It does not have to be subscribed to. Is it not true that our sanctions are worthless in the case of stores and businesses that are not subscribing to the code? The real problem is the lack of any real sanctioning.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister of State say that &ldquo;competition is the answer&rdquo;? I heard that answer given in the case of Glanbia. How could competition be the answer in Glanbia when 80% of the milk in Dublin is supplied by Glanbia? Is it being suggested that I go to Naas, Bray or Maynooth for a pint of milk in the morning? Competition works imperfectly for a variety of reasons. There is no point in the Minister saying to the House that he will consider the problem. The damage is being done now. Some people are engaged in excessive profit taking in anticipation of the euro. There are no effective sanctions. Is the Minister of State aware of the dual pricing implemented by some hoteliers and publicans, where clearly their conversions are not accurate? The converted prices are rounded off such that the benefit goes to the business concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Consumers Association of Ireland has highlighted this problem. Apart from appealing to the patriotism of businesses and retailers, what effective sanctions will the Minister of State put in place before it is too late to prevent the con<Col N="1393" /> sumer being ripped off as a result of the conversion to the euro?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all businesses are engaged in this practice, only some.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is leaving it to consumers. They have to be the watchdogs and cry foul. How does he intend to communicate with the consumers between now and the changeover? Now is the important time. I believe that prices are now being rounded up and the damage has already been done. In many cases, it will be too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last question, as regards communication with consumers, there exists the Consumers Association of Ireland, which is the recognised NGO in this country and it is very much involved in this project. We have given it funding to become involved in the policing process. It is doing it and we will hear from it. That is one way of involving the consumer because the Consumers Association of Ireland represents them.</P>
      <P>Also, I established a consumer advisory council which has had its second meeting. This is the first time this has been done in Ireland. It is a very representative group; it represents the interests of consumers. I do this in the context of raising the consumer voice.</P>
      <P>In regard to the points raised by Deputies, all subscribers to the code commit to carrying out the changeover to the euro fairly and not seeking advantage. They must use a six digit conversion rate. If someone does not comply with that, as the individual in question reported to the Deputy, that individual should also report that fact to the Director of Consumer Affairs because therein lies the real issue. The focus is on information on the dual display and that is why we place the focus on that. I will not rule out other actions if I believe they are required.</P>
      <P>Our focus to date has been on putting the onus on businesses. I still believe that to</P>
      <P>be the correct approach. We have seen price increases at various times imposed by certain businesses and I have heard anecdotal evidence or reports of prices increases in various outlets, some of which are a cause for concern. We have been in the dual price display period since 1 October and I warn business not to try to increase prices under the cloak of this changeover. I and other colleagues will expose anyone who does so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in touch with FÁS, the national training authority, and it has initiated a range of training advice and skills assessment for the company's staff. It is arranging one-to-one interviews to establish training needs. When these needs are identified, appropriate courses can be organised. In addition, information is being provided to staff who wish to start their own businesses. The work force is also being given access to employers who have suitable vacancies advertised with FÁS.</P>
      <P>The company, at its own expense, has engaged the services of a firm of consultants which has initiated a formal out placement programme. This will involve three specialists undertaking individual interviews with staff, assisting them with CV preparation and interview techniques, discussing career options and assisting them in job searches. This programme will run for approximately three months. The company is also facilitating approaches made by other employers inquiring about the availability of staff and it is contacting other companies which may be in a position to recruit additional staff.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Technology, Tallaght, has also offered its assistance in the provision of retraining courses. The IDA is seeking to identify suitable investors interested in acquiring the lease of the factory with a view to recommencing manufacturing activity at the plant and, if possible, the re-employment of some of the existing work force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this is the type of employment our constituency can ill-afford to lose, that these types of jobs are very difficult to replace and that the emphasis needed on up-skilling and in-service training is still not evident in this country? I presume the Minister knows that an agreement was concluded only a month in advance of the closure of this factory that would have involved an element of up-skilling and that might ultimately have led to the retention of at least part of the plant. I am sure she is also aware that a new facility was retained in mothballs for some time in the Whitestown industrial estate in the expectation that this company would have transferred there. Does it not bring into sharp focus the necessity for us to target training on workers in employment and up-skilling them where feasible? Many of these workers will find it difficult in the new climate to obtain alternative employment because the climate has changed dramatically, even in the short few months since the House last met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the company's plans. I acknowledge that it has given valuable employment in the Tallaght area since 1980 when it was first established at the facility. It was the case that the company was very optimistic about its future even though it had suffered losses in Dublin for the past three years. Owing to over capacity globally and the need for the company to restructure its global operation and shed more than 16,000 jobs, unfortunately the plant at</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> Tallaght became a victim of that decision and over capacity.</P>
    <P>Training is happening. It is the case that both indigenous and foreign companies located in Ireland are finding it very difficult to compete with China and many other countries in Asia and central and eastern Europe where labour is substantially cheaper. Where we have to compete is in what is called in the jargon &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; activity, something which is increasingly carried out in Ireland. It involves greater product development, design and innovation and where the labour input is a smaller proportion of the overall cost of the production of the product.</P>
    <P>That begs the question, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested, about the skills base of the work force. Clearly, an unskilled work force will not be suitable for employment in that area. We have seen fantastic examples throughout the country where new technology is being put in place in some old companies. Some very traditional companies are now highly successful. Even in the textile industry there are companies that have embraced technology, Michael H being a case in point which is competing very successfully by embracing, among other things, new technology and upgrading the skills base of the work force to use it. The same must apply across the board.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that, because of the global down turn in the high-tech sector, where we have seen the loss of 500,000 jobs so far over the past 12 months, 200,000 in the United States alone, and notwithstanding our best efforts on training and up-skilling we will unfortunately feel some of the effects of that downturn. The effects have not been as great as they might have been, but that is not to take away from the number of people who have lost their jobs. The national training fund and many of the initiatives, such as Skillnet, which is an employer-trade union initiative, and many of the other initiatives in place are working successfully to rebalance the efforts made in the past in training where it was almost exclusively the training of the unemployed. The balance is quickly moving to the training of the employed for a completely different work environment and scenario.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment one of my main objectives is to promote the ongoing development of the economy and, in the context of policy on economic migration, to mobilise the necessary skills and labour supply in the quantity and quality needed to secure suitable economic growth.</P>
      <P>The instruments of economic migration operated by my Department are the work permit scheme and the working authorisation-working visa scheme. In both cases the schemes are vacancy driven and the role my Department plays is to facilitate the entry of migrant workers in response to requests from employers. The admission of migrant workers has been market-led and the onus has been placed on employers to show that a particular individual or group of individuals was required and that no European Economic Area persons were available or willing to take the job.</P>
      <P>My Department is reviewing our economic migration policy and practices. This is an ongoing process and I assure the Deputy that I am keeping our policy on economic migration under close review so that it can contribute in a positive way to our future development and prosperity and so that it reflects changing labour market realities occurring in the global economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is important to ensure the quantity and quality of skills necessary is available to improve and develop the market. In the context of addressing the shortage of specific skills, will the Minister indicate the main areas for which work permit applications have been sought? In the aftermath of 11 September and the world wide economic slowdown, does she expect difficulties to arise in certain sectors, especially the tourism sector which utilised this process to employ workers?</P>
      <P>Benchmarking of skills is another issue. Many people come into the country with a particular skill and the work available does not match their aspirations. About 75% of all applicants are unskilled. The Department's role is to address the shortage of specific skills especially in relation to sectors experiencing difficulties. What are the main sectors experiencing difficulties now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1397" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of work permit applications in the 12 months to September was 38,037. This year there have been 26,879 to date. Of the total, the number of work permits issued was 34,150. Refusals numbered 707 and 1,128 were withdrawn. The events of 11 September compounded the global downturn already under way but even prior to that we were reviewing the work permit regime in place. We had a very liberal regime over the last number of months because we wished to satisfy the need in the economy. Notwithstanding the stricter criteria now or the closer scrutiny on a sector by sector basis, particularly in tourism, the number of applications remains strong. There may be some lag and we are inquiring from employers who made applications a few weeks ago if their applications are still relevant. In so far as we can ascertain the answer seems to be yes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. Working visas are skills based for the IT sector, nursing, building professionals, engineers and so on but applications across the work permit regime tend to be in the more low skilled area particularly agriculture and fisheries which account for about 4,168 of the figures; catering accounts for 6,991. They seem to be the two main areas where there is a huge demand for labour throughout the country and the economy. There are foreign workers working in low skilled activity in every county. That begs questions of our migration policy. In the context of a downturn those employees are probably less mobile and we must move forward and cease dealing with work permits on a fire brigade basis. Nobody anticipated reaching the situation where we have over 60,000 foreign workers in the country. Our economic transformation was so rapid that none of the economists predicted that. We have the capacity to take the pedal off the work permit regime if there is any sign that the live register is increasing. The employment of our own people and EEA nationals must be the priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are quite a number of people anxious to get back into the workforce but due to the taxation system they are unable to do so? The figure of 60,000 is an issue of concern and the Minister should ensure that they are all doing the work specified on their entry permits. It is important that applications run smoothly but the quality and quantity of the work are very important or we could have a disenfranchised workforce in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that the 60,000 are not all work permits. Many of them are EEA nationals who do not require a permit. One can have an open view as to whether someone should get a permit and be able to move employment and not have bonded labour. Some suggest that is the way forward and that is how we operate at the moment but there are downsides to that. It is a grey area and difficult to have a policy suitable <Col N="1398" /> for every situation. That is why we have flexibility and that is the most appropriate way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 96, 127 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>Our Department has specific responsibility for providing information to assist all businesses, including SMEs, with their preparations for the changeover to the euro on 1 January next. The EMU business awareness campaign, which is managed by Forfás on behalf of our Department, has undertaken this task since it was launched back in December 1996.</P>
      <P>A survey undertaken in July on behalf of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign showed that there were still a large number of businesses throughout the country that have yet to prepare for the changeover. Following this my Department provided an additional £1.26 million (1.59 million) to finance the campaign to the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The campaign produced two key information resources during 2001: &ldquo;Getting your Business Ready for the Euro&rdquo;&ndash; over 215,000 copies have been distributed; and &ldquo;Getting your Retail Business Ready for the Euro&rdquo;&ndash; over 230,000 of these have been distributed. With further specific emphasis on retailers, Forfás produced a training kit for retailers in September 2001 which has been distributed to approximately 40,000 retailers. It includes a one function euro calculator, ready reckoner conversion charts and a euro training manual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, in association with FÁS, an extensive programme of training sessions for retailers has been planned throughout the country until the end of November. Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that they are <Col N="1399" /> able to conduct their business in euro from 1 January next, and the EMU business awareness campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist them to do this. We are satisfied that the necessary information has been, and continues to be, provided to Irish businesses to facilitate them with this task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. My experience of the response to a training session in Longford organised by the enterprise board is that there was a very small turnout. The organisers were disappointed. Either everybody knows everything about it already or few know anything. I opt for the latter. The Minister of State's response endorses my view. The Department has done little about it and the ordinary retailers are being left to carry the can. People in businesses are being asked to act as <i>bureaux de change. </i>Leave it to the shopkeepers. That is the situation.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if a customer walks into a commercial bank now and asks for £100 over the counter he will be told to go to the hole-in-the-wall for it? That is happening. Does the Minister expect the ordinary shopkeeper to do the Government's job in this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the allegation that the Department has not done enough. The job of making businesses aware has been undertaken by Forfás since 1996. Numerous publications involving 1.7 million pieces of literature have been circulated. This survey shows that there is still a lot of work to be done by businesses. I reject that the agency has not done its job well but I agree with the Deputy that the business community needs to redouble its efforts. It needs to get its act together 9and get into top gear. We dealt with the consumers' role earlier and much useful work has been done but businesses should up their performance in the coming weeks. Some of the statistics show that there is considerable work still to be done in regard to software and staff training. I accept that but there is time to do it. The Deputy is right and he mentioned two possible reasons for the lack of interest in the meeting he attended. Some elements of the business community have a lot of work to do in the weeks ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the huge expense for retailers in the changeover to the euro which is a point that people have not addressed? Also banks charge £7 for £1,000 of coins. All retail outlets and banks must be addressed by the Minister. There is little reference to the banking fraternity, which is a major oversight. Is he aware that dual pricing is not on display at all outlets, as was meant to be the case from 1 October? The insurance for holding cash during the dual currency period and charges for electronic payment and credit cards must be looked into. As Napoleon described Britain, we <Col N="1400" /> are a nation of shopkeepers and the Minister has taken the wrong approach. Much literature has been distributed but the consumer is uneducated about the currency exchange. There is a vacuum.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy can see in my declaration of interest, I do not have an interest in any major retail outlet, but that is an important element in how the retailers treat their consumers during the changeover. I am confident they will hold their sales at the right time and that sufficient work will be done between now and then to allow consumers to get familiar with dual display. As the Deputy knows, a great deal of work is being done by my Department and the euro <Col N="1401" /> changeover board under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. By 1 January, we will all be sick of the information. It is an important point but should be addressed to the retail sector.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's point, which Deputy Rabbitte raised earlier, and I share their concerns. I also have information about some businesses raising prices. It is important that consumers take note of that since they have the right to take their business elsewhere. There are specific rules in the code that I mentioned earlier about rounding. Those who have signed up to the code, but are not honouring it, can be reported to the Director of Consumer Affairs who has the ultimate sanction of refusing them the right to display the logo. It is incumbent on consumers to play their part and both the director and I will work with them to expose anyone taking advantage of the changeover period.</P>

        <b>:</b> I reiterate the concerns about confusion. The Minister must accept that 1 January will bring the introduction of the euro and the January sales come on top of that.

If any business has not updated its systems, it should do so immediately. I acknowledged that many must get properly prepared. I am satisfied that on 1 January the consumer will be properly informed but some businesses need to do more. There will be another survey at the end of this month and we will know then what improvements have been achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &ndash; known as the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day to day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code which is enforced in a proactive manner by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority continues to regard the construction sector as a priority area of activity and, in this regard, the additional financial and staffing resources which I have secured for the authority, are being put to particular effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness raising activities. However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in that sector, a continuance of a partnership approach to health and safety, as embodied by the construction safety partnership, is crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSP is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and <Col N="1403" /> other relevant Departments and agencies. In November 2000 it produced a detailed three year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan includes measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas including the initiation of a safety representatives pilot project. This project has resulted so far in the provision of training for 160 safety representatives and is a highly commendable joint ICTU/CIF project. Other areas of progress include the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, increased inspection by the Health and Safety Authority and the establishment of a joint ICTU/CIF safety council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply on the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority. Nevertheless, this question was prompted by the regrettable number of fatalities on building sites over the summer months, which was exceptionally high. Will the Minister accept that he has a responsibility to see that workers are protected? In relation to summer student workers, will the Minister insist that these workers be given a proper safety training course? Generally, these workers clean up on building sites and they need protection. Will the Minister also accept that time constraints on contracts lead to corners being cut? With competition again increasing in the construction industry, does the Minister accept that this will also lead to corners being cut to reduce costs? In the best interests of workers, for whom this House has a responsibility, will the Minister ensure for the workforce &ndash; skilled and unskilled &ndash; that building sites in Ireland are safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this sector requires particular attention. In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for labour, I have given this more attention than other sectors. Farming is another sector that needs particular attention because of the number of accidents and fatalities. The Deputy may be aware that I have decided to change the regulations in relation to training. We now have the concept of mandatory training, and mandatory safety representation will be part of new regulations which I hope to sign shortly. I will raise the issue of students working with the CIF because their protection during summer work is an important consideration.</P>

    <P>The construction safety partnership plan, in bringing together CIF and ICTU, is the way forward in relation to the cutting of corners. Many of these issues have been brought to the fore through this plan and there is now a greater awareness of how to deal with these issues in a partnership way. Companies and unions working <Col N="1404" /> together is the best way to ensure proper management structures are in place, and that workers on sites wear the proper protection. Much work has been done but I accept that the figures are very worrying. The authority has told me that there were 19 construction fatalities in 2000 and 15 fatal accidents reported to date this year. One death is one death too many.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this is an area that requires a sense of urgency on his part. Enforcement and detection play a crucial role in ensuring a reduction in accidents at work. Perhaps consideration might be given by his Department, in the context of revised legislation, to on-the-spot fines. The wearing of safety clothing and equipment are matters of fact. If an inspector enters a site and sees that workers do not have the appropriate equipment, that is a matter of fact. It can be dealt with by means of on-the-spot fine and not by the procrastination which appears to be the order of the day from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last question, I asked the HSA to review the legislation which is over ten years old. The issue of on-the-spot fines is central. It is one with which I want to deal as soon as possible. The review is now back from the HSA and I will deal with it as soon as I can.</P>
      <P>On the question of consulting with farm organisations, I have and will continue to consult with them in relation to farm accidents. There have been far too many accidents, particularly involving young children. We have worked closely with all the farming organisations and will continue to do so. In fact, many construction accidents take place on isolated sites related to farms, with people carrying out works on farms or renovating buildings. It is interesting to see from the figures that on the larger, well organised construction sites, the number of accidents and fatalities is thankfully low. We will continue to consult with farming organisations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The board of Aer Lingus met yesterday, 9 October, and was updated on the current state of the industry, the trading position of Aer Lingus and the plan being prepared by management to address the serious issues facing the company. I understand the plan will be finalised within the next week and the following week it will be submitted to me. As of today I understand staff and their representatives are being provided with a full briefing on the matter. The chairman has given me an outline of the grave situation facing the airline. Aer Lingus is losing £2 million per day and is therefore haemorrhaging cash. Without action the company will run out of cash early next year and is forecasting a loss of £74 million in this year and losses of £120 to £130 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>As a result of the events of 11 September, bookings, particularly on the transatlantic flights, have been dramatically reduced. Recovery next year is difficult to predict given the uncertainty about the US military situation. Without urgent action the company will be insolvent within a short period of time. Let me be perfectly clear, what is at stake is the survival of this company.</P>
    <P>The chairman believes, and has told me so, that there is a need for a reduction of 2,500 people in the workforce. I regret that this should be necessary. As I said in the House on 4 October last, one of my key aims is to protect the maximum number of sustainable jobs. That means taking action to ensure we will have an airline, fundamentally restructured, which will have a basis from which to grow in the future when markets improve.</P>
    <P>In relation to State aid, I already outlined on 4 October last that I had discussions on the current difficulties in the aviation sector with the European Transport Commissioner and my Belgian counterpart who is currently President of the Transport Council. The financial state of European airlines and the question of compensation as a result of the events of 11 September will be discussed at the next meeting in Luxembourg of the Transport Council next Tuesday. At that meeting, I will seek to ensure that, at a minimum, European airlines are not disadvantaged in relation to their US competitors.</P>
    <P>I will also meet the French Transport Minister, Jean Claude Gayssot, in Dublin on Friday. I have already spoken by telephone with him concerning the issue and intend to have a meeting with him after he has concluded his seminar.</P>
    <P>The US Government responded quickly to the serious difficulties of its airlines and significant amounts in assistance have already been paid out in recent days. In the case of one airline, Delta Airlines, a competitor of Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route, this amounted to almost US$327 million. In line with that I wish to tell the House that in the Department today Doreen Keaney accessed the Internet and found two airlines who are operating transatlantic into Ireland. Continental received almost $200 million from the US Government in direct aid and Delta Airlines received almost $326 million. In the <i>Irish Inde<Col N="1407" />pendent</i> today Delta Airlines was reported to be offering return fares to New York at £118. When they talk about the distortion of the EU market, it is my belief &ndash; I will state these matters very clearly to the Commissioner next week &ndash; that money given by the US Congress directly to those two airlines who are operating direct flights between the US and Ireland distorts the market hugely. I understand that Delta will shortly make a further announcement.</P>
    <P>I will be calling for an urgent response to address the European airline industry's difficulties in these exceptional circumstances taking account of the need for a level playing field on the transatlantic route. In adopting my position, I will take into consideration the plan submitted by Aer Lingus, the strategic interests of Ireland as well as the fair competition issues.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the importance of direct transatlantic links to the Irish economy and their contribution in recent years to the tourism industry as well as the manufacturing and services sectors. These links are crucial for attracting US tourists and facilitating business traffic. I will also be pointing out that the transatlantic aviation market is proportionately more vital to the Irish economy than it is to the economy of any other EU member state. This case is greatly strengthened when one takes account of our small population and our island status. In support of this case, Ireland ranks seventh among the 15 EU countries in terms of passengers carried on direct routes to the US, Aer Lingus accounts for 70% of that direct Ireland-US traffic and the transatlantic routes account for up to 60% of Aer Lingus's profits &ndash; when it was making profits. These three simple facts demonstrate why the impact of the events of 11 September were so severe on Aer Lingus and why direct links with the US are a matter of strategic importance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the question of the Shannon transatlantic policy which has been raised in public in recent days. Government policy on Shannon remains unchanged. It should be obvious that a viable future for Shannon is dependent on the survival of Aer Lingus. Government policy is that both Aer Lingus and Shannon survive as viable entities going forward. I will now take individual questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will enthusiastically support the Minister in any possible way in this campaign. What position was put to the Commissioner last week with regard to State aid and what was her response to the model of support that was sought? Does the Minister reject out of hand the reported position of the EU Commission in regard to State aid which we heard today limits it to compensation for just three or four days of lost business? Does the Minister reject this as being an incorrect interpretation of the stated EU guidelines in regard to State aid which permits restructuring in exceptional circumstances, a <Col N="1408" /> point which the Commissioner does not appear to have taken on board? </P>
      <P>What form of package does the Minister envisage and what will be the elements for which approval will be sought when the Minister meets the Commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his statement of support for the plan that will be put forward, it is much appreciated. When I spoke to the Commissioner I explained Ireland's position and having listened carefully she said she would make a statement in addition to Commissioner Monti, which they did today and to which the Deputy referred. As the Deputy said, it is restricted in that they both talk about slots, security, safety, insurance, the four days and arising out of the four days the damage suffered by the airlines. She then goes on to respond to questions from the press, one of which referred to Sabena &ndash; I do not have the press cuttings here &ndash; and the fact that the Government had made bridging finance available for one month. She talked, <i>inter alia,</i> of limited Government backed loans to an airline company in the event that it could prove it had a particular case which would stand to be considered under the exceptional circumstances. That is a follow-on from earlier matters. I have just got this statement in the past 20 minutes and, obviously, Deputy Seán Ryan has also read it. They are the two measures which she and Commissioner Monti are adopting. There will be a full agenda of items to be discussed next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday the Taoiseach will go to Brussels to meet the Commission on a general statement but obviously Aer Lingus will be mentioned. I have spoken to Commissioner David Byrne. I will meet the Irish Ambassador to the EU, Ambassador Anne Anderson, at 6 p.m. and will outline what I intend to say next Tuesday. In turn she will be speaking to her colleagues.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the announcement made today by the Commission is only peanuts in relation to funding and support for Aer Lingus or any of the national carriers and that no consideration has been given to the damage caused due to the falling passenger numbers? What case does the Minister intend to make to the Council of Ministers? Is it only in relation to redundancy or a viability package as put forward by Aer Lingus? What specific approval is the Minister seeking from the Commission? What discussions have taken place with her Belgian counterpart who will chair that Council meeting? With how many of her Council of Ministers colleagues has she been in direct contact? What type of support has she received from those individuals in relation to the case put forward on the floor of the House? Will the Minister agree that the Belgian Government has been prepared to put its neck on the line and support its national carrier? Will she agree that the same should have happened here and that she should support our national carrier to ensure its future viability?</P>

      <P>I met Ms Isabelle Durant who is the Belgian President of the Council of Ministers last Monday week and we had a long conversation. Each Minister is concerned with his or her airlines but, obviously, they are interested to hear what each person has to say. I will meet the French Minister on Friday with whom I will have a full conversation. I will go to Brussels on Monday to attend a telecommunications Council of Ministers meeting but I intend to use Monday afternoon and Monday evening to have bilateral meetings with each of my colleagues. The Deputy asked how the Belgian Government was prepared to be up-front in seeking aid. The Commissioner, Ms De Palacio, was asked that question today at her press conference and she said the reason for that is that Sabena was about to be grounded, it was within a day of going bankrupt. I do not propose to allow that to happen to Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the question asked by Deputy Bruton and perhaps the Minister will reply. What is the Minister's view on the statement we have all seen that the only areas in which she will be allowed to involve herself relate to supporting insurance premiums, extra security costs and direct losses due to 11 September? Is that a false statement, is it a statement we can ignore? If the Minister agrees with that statement she may as well not go to the meeting next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What discussions have taken place about the loss of 2,500 jobs and the payments that will be made to those people if that is the figure that has to be arrived at? Will there be only the statutory redundancy payments or will there be extra payments? Many of these people have worked for many years in Aer Lingus, have been responsible for its growth and success and are now to be thrown out by the Government. On 16 October will the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, <Col N="1410" /> who will attend the ECOFIN meeting, sing off the same hymn sheet as the Minister at the transport meeting or will something different be said to the economic and finance Ministers? Has the Minister had an opportunity to involve the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in the discussions taking place given the huge damage that will be created in the constituency of Dublin North and other areas? Some of the Minister's colleagues from constituencies north of the Liffey are present. What discussions has she had with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to begin preparations to provide work for these people in the event of this number of jobs being lost in that area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who is extremely concerned. Indeed all Deputies in front and behind me are extremely concerned about the matter. The Deputy will appreciate that concern is not only on one side of the House. The Deputy asked if the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I would sing from the same hymn sheet. He will be at one meeting and I will be at the other.</P>

That work will continue tomorrow. The size of the package will be eventually negotiated. That is not for me on the floor of the House, that is for negotiation between management, unions and workers. I welcome the question asked by Deputy Quinn today, if the Taoiseach would consider the inclusion of ICTU in working through the proposals. I understand that Dermot McCarthy, chairman of the National Implementation Body, and ICTU have been talking together. I expect those details would be worked through at that level.</P>

Will she now formulate a Government response to the Commission's proposal for inclusion at both the Transport Council and ECOFIN Council, thereby ensuring that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is on board?

I spoke to him about the issue the following week and I will be talking to him again at the weekend during the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Minister agree that the announcement by the Commission today in regard to the restrictions on the amount of finance that can be made by member states is a minimalist approach and will do nothing to address the crisis in Aer Lingus which is of a much broader dimension? Will she agree that the European Commission decision is ill-timed and pre-emptive and is designed to pull the rug from under the Minister and her Transport counterparts who are meeting next week? In other words, it is saying &ldquo;This is it, we are doing this by diktat&rdquo;? What kind of collective xenophobia is afflicting the European Commission which cannot see there has been a change of policy, a U-turn, on the part of the United States which is giving £327 million to Delta and £200 million to Continental Airlines flying into this country while Europe dogmatically decides it will not do a U-turn? Can the Minister and her counterparts at the Transport Ministers Council meeting next week collectively overturn the Commission's decision or is it the bureaucrats or their so-called political masters who are calling the shots?</P>

I do not consider this statement meets Irish requirements which I will outline clearly when in Luxembourg on Tuesday. I will outline clearly my position on our special status and the moneys provided to Delta and Continental Airlines. I intend to make our position very clear and to bring forward the plan for the restructured Aer Lingus at the Council of Ministers. I will then <Col N="1413" /> make my case based on the restructuring of Aer Lingus.</P>

As she will be aware, Cork does not operate a transatlantic route, nevertheless flights from Cork will be affected by the downturn in the airline industry. I have seen today's report from the European Commission which offers no element of comfort to Cork airport. Will the Minister indicate how she proposes supporting jobs in the Cork region within Aer Lingus? What proportion of the 2,500 jobs under threat will be in the Cork region?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Has the Minister for Public Enterprise any realisation that the proposed destruction of 2,500 jobs mooted by the board of Aer Lingus is tantamount to the destruction of the national airline as we know it? Does she agree it would mean the dismemberment of virtually all the different sections including the outsourcing of all services, perhaps keeping cabin crew and pilots, which would undoubtedly be flogged off down the line? Does she not understand that this will lay waste communities in north and west Dublin, Shannon and Cork? Will she tell the truth about what is involved, that is, that the international aviation industry is cynically using the atrocities of 11 September to carry out massive rationalisation of hundreds of thousands of jobs, which they wanted to do prior to 11 September, but could not do so for political reasons in the various countries? Does she understand that the EU Commission is part of the conspiracy because it wants to privatise all the nationally owned airline carriers, and this is the opportunity for it to push through this policy which it could not politically get through heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister wake up to what is going on or is she prepared to stand up for the interests of Irish workers and the Irish population in this instance? Will she admit it is incredible that a mere four weeks following the atrocity we are witnessing the virtual destruction of the national airline on the basis of the drop-off in transatlantic numbers and the projected losses for two or three years? What about a development plan to increase the numbers in a very short time, which will inevitably happen? Does she understand that since low fares were advertised two days ago Aer Lingus cannot cope with the massive bookings? The Minister referred to the downturn in bookings. Is she aware from the board of Aer Lingus that the airline cannot handle the volume of <Col N="1414" /> bookings and, therefore, it is entirely possible to put the national airline on a viable footing as a nationally owned entity if there is a will and a plan?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that the main threat to Aer Lingus as a viable, state-of-the-art publicly owned company is not the events of 11 September or the EU Commission but her Department, the most senior officials in which do not want to maintain Aer Lingus in public ownership? They want to see it privatised and are prepared to use any excuse to bring that about. Is the Minister aware that one of them stated publicly that the problem with the State putting money into Aer Lingus is not the EU Commission but because it is a foolish thing to do and that the national airline should be privatised? Will she agree that if the Government is not prepared to give the necessary resources to Aer Lingus in investment or loans to tide it over this difficult time and to lay the basis for full recovery that it will be responsible for and complicit in the sabotage of one of our most vital national resources and the sabotage of the lives of workers and the communities in which they live? I hope Aer Lingus workers, their families and communities rise up against the Government to compel it to invest the necessary funding, irrespective of what the EU or those in favour of privatisation say.</P>

I will not propose that Aer Lingus <Col N="1415" /> should survive in a state which would leave it in the same situation in six or nine months time. It cannot continue to lose £2 million per day. It will make every effort to get bookings and to encourage people to travel. It can well cope with bookings they are getting.

      <P>I do not accept that the document which came from Brussels this morning must be accepted by us. Neither do I accept that there must be 2,500 job losses. The Minister led us to believe that the viability plan has not been finalised by the board. However, if that is so I do not know how the workers had access to it today. Secondly, she said it would be presented to her on Saturday or Sunday and that it would be brought to Brussels on Tuesday. We all remember the very difficult period in the early 1990s and the Cahill plan. Notwithstanding the reservations, does the Minister accept that one of the successes in bringing about a resurgence in Aer Lingus at that time was the involvement of the trade unions and the workers? In that context will she accept it is totally illogical to bring a viability plan to Brussels without any consultation with the workers? Will she now agree to discuss the document? I do not believe there was any meaningful document to discuss today.</P>
      <P>In the context of the exceptional circumstances which have existed since 11 September, is the Minister or the Government prepared to go to Brussels on Tuesday and to have a showdown with the Commission? Will the Minister accept that existing policy can be changed? It is not the bureaucrats who will bring about that change but the political leaders. Will the Minister give a specific commitment that she is prepared to go to Brussels and, in the interests of workers, the regions and of north Dublin in particular, ensure the policy is changed if necessary?</P>

The alliances I have already begun to form and the presentation I will make will, I hope, lay the foundation for our case to the Commission. I will speak in favour of the workers and of keeping the company viable. I want Aer Lingus to remain in operation. The financial situation of the company is extremely perilous and it will very quickly become insolvent &ndash; within the next few months according to the chairman &ndash; if there is no restructuring. If that occurred, we would be here discussing what happened. I am not prepared to <Col N="1416" /> allow that happen, but I am prepared to put my case strongly in Brussels.

      <P>The Minister will also be aware that in the context of aviation in Europe she has some latitude in terms of peripherality of airports such as Shannon Airport and in terms of public service obligations through which Shannon Airport could be assisted given that it would be more directly affected than any other location because of its reliance on transatlantic business.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about her plan in relation to State aid. What is her interpretation of a level playing pitch? My understanding is that the US Government has given state aid that will cover 80% of the projected losses of their carriers for this year, only half of which was related to the 11 September attacks. They are giving substantial state aid in cash, not in loans. Furthermore, does she believe that Aer Lingus can be long-term viable if the only form of aid is in loans, as she appears to be implying? We are told there are losses of £2 million a day, that is £180 million before the end of the year, and £125 million in redundancy payments. We are potentially talking about £300 million, £400 million or £500 million in loans. That would leave the company debt-ridden and unable to produce a viable future. Can the Minister clarify what is the nature of her plan?</P>

      <P>Can I pursue the question raised by Deputy Stagg in relation to an agreed Government position between the Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy? To ensure that the hymn singing is totally harmonious, will the Government make a written submission to be circulated at the meetings on Tuesday, for which I understand there is precedence, so that there will be a cohesive and well thought out approach from Government and that there will be no doubt in the minds of other Ministers attending and of the Commission? Furthermore, is the Minister aware of the vital importance of air access to the Shannon region? I accept what she said about safeguarding Shannon but if competition is to supersede policy in terms of regional development and cohesion, we are giving way to the competition issue in relation to our dealings with the European Union. It is vitally important that the Minister emphasise regional development and cohesion and the importance to Shannon, as other people here have said, of airline traffic in view of the fact that 35% of airline traffic in Shannon is transatlantic whereas it is only 17% in Dublin. Will the Minister give us an undertaking that she will ensure that the interests <Col N="1421" /> of Shannon will be uppermost, particularly in relation to regional policy?</P>

If that is the case, will an emergency meeting of the Cabinet be held this weekend when the Minister receives the viability plan for Aer Lingus? The Minister spoke earlier about our special status. Will the Minister explain to the House why she has had discussions with only one of her counterparts in the EU, her Belgian counterpart, and the reason she has not met her other 14 colleagues prior to next Tuesday? Will she ensure that she will meet those colleagues? Two weeks of board meetings have taken place, yet she has not met any of her colleagues bar one. This disaster happened a month ago and the Minister has still not met them. Why has the Minister not discussed this issue with her colleagues? Are there no phones in her Department?</P>

        <b>: </b>I want to ask the Minister about the net question, that is the loss of 2,500 jobs, which the Minister seems to accept. If Aer Lingus sheds 2,500 jobs, will that not totally undermine the company? How can a company shed 40% of its workforce while sustaining either volume or quality of service? Does the Minister not agree that if she accepts a reduction of 2,500 jobs, instead of it being the kiss of life this will be the kiss of death for Aer Lingus? Will she not accept that a company that made £60 million profit as a group in 1999 and has now run into a series of short-term crises, including foot and mouth disease, industrial relations problems, which thankfully have been sorted out, and the 11 September attacks, has the capacity to trade back into viability if it is given a financial injection, time and scope?</P>

      <P>The House knows that the Minister takes her responsibilities seriously but will she accept that it was the shilly-shallying and the toing and froing on the ownership issue which placed the airline in a very vulnerable position, and that the Taoiseach and herself are primarily responsible for that? In relation to restructuring the airline and making it successful again, which everybody wants, does the Minister see any lines along which we might proceed to address the underfunding of the pension funds over the years? People accept that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta were seriously underfunded. Does the Minister see any scope in that area? Does she have confidence in the current management team?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About six months ago we celebrated the strong performance of the 1999 accounts and the tremendous sacrifices made by the workers during the 1990s. Looking at comparisons with British Airways and some of the smaller European <Col N="1422" /> airlines which are trying to restructure &ndash; I am not talking about Sabena, which got into trouble &ndash; does the Minister have confidence in the current management team?</P>
    <P>I want to ask about the north side and the west side of Dublin. In mid-August I wrote to the Taoiseach about the jobs meltdown that was beginning in the west and north of Dublin when 2,000 jobs were lost at Gateway. Job losses have accelerated during September. Dublin City Council and, I understand, Fingal County Council passed motions demanding a jobs task force for the Dublin region to address the devastation that has hit the IT and related industries. The aviation industry is the linchpin for the current job losses. The Taoiseach has not responded to Dublin City Council and we continue to wait for him to take a lead as the representative of our region. Perhaps the Minister will convey my concern to him.</P>

Will it mean, for example, no more Aer Lingus flights to Cork or between midnight and the morning? What effect will the restructuring and the job losses have on Aer Rianta? What are the cash reserves available to the company? Do they amount to £185 million the Minister referred to in the Dáil last Thursday and can they be used to ameliorate the losses?</P>

With regard to her interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, is she saying that the Government is prepared, given the necessary approval, to make available loans or grants to the company to enable it discharge its redundancy obligations? Does she agree that long-serving colleagues in Aer Lingus could not reasonably expect to lose their jobs for any less compensation than was forthcoming in the Cahill plan?</P>

This will be subject to further exploration but in their statement today the two Commissioners referred briefly to guaranteed state loans.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Sullivan's concern about Shannon Airport continuing as a gateway to the mid-west and the Shannon region.

      <P>I will speak to the Taoiseach about Deputy Broughan's concerns and I am sure he will reply to the Deputy. I will ask the chairman about the pension fund in the restructuring talks.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is extremely elitist in that it deals with what we in the country regard as the Dublin 4 syndrome. Will the Minister indicate <Col N="1426" /> what moneys will be disbursed to the provinces, rather than just to the arty-farty section of society primarily centred on the south sides of our inner cities? We all love our heritage and we bemoan the fact that every day of the week it seems to go down the drain like rain water after a thunder storm. That happens without interference from Government agencies, by and large, and often without interference from local authorities. On some occasions local authorities may be responsible for the destruction of our heritage.</P>
      <P>Every time I see an old building being bulldozed, an excavation taking place of a new road or a house building project, I ask myself, &ldquo;Is there anybody supervising that work to see that our heritage is not being eroded, removed or destroyed?&rdquo; I know at first hand of many instances where ancient national monuments have been destroyed wilfully, particularly by developers who know that if they report the finding of something historical it will hold up their work. They will suffer a financial loss as a result. It is only human nature that they would try to evade it, but people should have a civic spirit which would overcome their monetary concerns. They should have a civic spirit that would want to see valuable heritage retained. The Minister's Department does not have the resources or the personnel to supervise the safeguarding of our heritage and that is why I say the Bill is elitist.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about our history. I am concerned that every time an old person in my neighbourhood, in my county or in any part of the country dies, a huge chunk of unrecorded history goes with them. I have said before that it is a disgrace that the work of the Irish Folklore Commission, which was set up shortly after the foundation of the State, is locked away in the vaults of University College Dublin. It is very difficult for someone down the country who wants to do some research to gain access to it. I am disgusted at that. It is not right that history, gathered in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s by the Irish Folklore Commission, is locked away and not freely available to libraries and other interested groups such as historical societies. There are recordings of interviews and first-hand accounts of the famine, the Fenian rising, the Land League, land grabbers and evictions. All that history is recorded but not available. If you go to your local county library you will not get it. It is here in Dublin and it is stowed away, as are many of our historical masterpieces which are in the National Museum or some other museum or centre here in Dublin. The Minister should open up this store of knowledge which has not been given back to the people in the provinces. It has been retained here and it is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill means well but is very restricted in that it deals only with projects which will involve the spending of more than £250,000. That is a very considerable sum of money and undoubtedly there are some valuable works of art, artefacts and manuscripts that can be purchased and added to the store of national treasures. However, <Col N="1427" /> everyday history, recent and from earlier centuries, is being absolutely neglected and I would like to see that rectified. The Minister has a Department to address that, but she does not seem to be interested. I have repeatedly asked questions on this subject and I did not get any response. We are pawned off by being told that Dúchas has been given the task of seeing that these treasures are preserved. What I mean by treasures is our heritage. However, I do not see any practical work being done on the ground. I see buildings in my area being destroyed.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look into the following case. During a recent building development the remains of a 12th century church in my town, Dungarvan, were partly or largely removed. What a national treasure that is. I would also like her to inquire into what has happened and is happening with the restoration and opening up of a well at Shandon, near the very famous Dan Fraher Field. A well which is hundreds of years old and was the only water supply for the people of my town in the middle ages and later centuries has been covered up and abandoned. It will never be preserved. Those are simple things, but they are important. That is the spice of life as far as our history is concerned. That is our history.</P>
    <P>What about the Geneva Barracks near Passage East in Country Waterford? History tells us that the Croppy Boy was hung there. That has been let go to wrack and ruin. Why are places like that not preserved? What about Lismore Castle, which I have referred to repeatedly in this House? It is one of the most historic buildings in the country, dating back many centuries. The owners are willing to see that the west wing of the castle is preserved and enhanced but the Minister refuses to make money available for that purpose. Perhaps some of the money to which the Minister is referring would be devoted to that project. It would require a couple of million pounds to restore it. It is one of the most imposing buildings that one will see in Ireland, but it is in need of extensive renovation.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to go outside Dublin to ensure heritage down the country is retained and enhanced? What about the liosanna that have been bulldozed away over the years? What about the different types of ring forts that have been eradicated, without anything having been done about it?</P>
    <P>I have continuously pleaded in this House for the Government to set up a statutory body to ensure the strong ethnic links between the south east, particularly the Waterford estuary, and Newfoundland are retained and that their history be explored. What has happened? Nothing.</P>
    <P>In 1996 or 1997, we appointed an honorary consul in Newfoundland. Other than that, I have not seen any tangible results of efforts to preserve the link. Tens of thousands of people from the Waterford estuary area settled in Newfoundland, as did people from south Kilkenny, south Tip<Col N="1428" /> perary, Wexford, south Carlow, east Waterford and Waterford city. The colony is still in existence and the emigrants' ancestors are still there in huge numbers. We pretend they do not exist, which is a huge dereliction of our historical past and a huge dereliction of our heritage. That is what annoys me about this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against James Joyce. He is wonderful and his works are a national treasure, but why expend the moneys that are available on a very few national treasures and those centred in and around Dublin? Why not broaden the list of treasures that receive money? Why do people have to come from the country to the National Library or UCD to study the records? Why can they not be dispersed to the authorities throughout the country?</P>
    <P>I spoke of the links between south east Ireland and Newfoundland. It makes me green with envy when I go to places like Nova Scotia and see the links that are retained between the Scottish Gaelic people and the Western Isles and Cape Breton and its surrounding islands. They put us to shame. We are a disgrace in comparison with what the Canadians, British, and Scottish in particular, have done. We are making no attempt to do something similar. I know that our spokesperson, Deputy McGinley, chairman of the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language, has been to that area and he knows what I am talking about. We have no pride in our history. We have no pride in our heritage. We are concerned only about bulldozing it down and ploughing it into the ground.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing today has a praiseworthy aspect. The thing that counts to the ordinary Irish man and woman is the history of what happened in the past. I am speaking about the ordinary working man &ndash; farm labourers, builders' labourers, county council workers, those who worked in industries under awful conditions, members of the armed forces in the past 70 years, members of An Garda Síochána or members of the RIC before them &ndash; whose blood, toil and sweat made this country what it is. They want to commemorate historic figures. They want the records of what such people did and what they said. They would like to know their history and their achievements. Ours is a society that does not seem to care about the past. Affluence has overtaken us and has made us indifferent to the things about which we should be concerned.</P>

There is much scope for development in relation to our heritage. Having sat through some of the debates here today, I wish the Minister well because she has had so many offerings of advice as to what she should do and a geographical tour of Ireland telling her what she needs to be fixing&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had to laugh at the multiple references to &ldquo;down the country&rdquo; and &ldquo;coming up from the country&rdquo; to Dublin. I have to come down to Dublin and go back up the country to my constituency. Maybe I should put in a pitch for what is up the country, where we have a lot more heritage sites than much of the rest of the country. I can argue that point because, a few years ago we did a tour of Ireland and, to me, every hole in the hedge had a granny's kitchen and a standing stone. About three coach loads of people seemed to stop to look wherever any site seemed to be.</P>
      <P>If we had been exploiting our heritage and background to the same extent as was being done further south, particularly south of the traditional Galway-Dublin divide, we would have left the rest of the country standing in terms of what we had to offer.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be here today. Every time there is money given out and there is a new Vote for money, the Minister has to be congratulated for achieving the Vote. The vote is £10 million over the next five years, of which £3 million is available after the enactment of this Bill. It must be important that we are considering the Heritage Fund Bill now and that money is coming through.</P>
      <P>I agree with what was said by many speakers earlier concerning the bringing of heritage to the people and the acquisition of significant artefacts, whatever they may be. One will never be stuck for a list of articles suitable for purchase. That will be one of the Minister's less significant difficulties. It is a matter of limiting what one can buy to the £10 million.</P>
      <P>Originally, I misread the statement in the Minister's speech that referred to acquiring important items of moveable heritage. I thought it meant the Minister was going to bring artefacts around the country. I then encountered references to the national collections, which brought us back into the Dublin realm. I am sorry to say I will be adding my voice of dissent to the concept of centralisation. Many throughout the country want to see living history. They want to see history brought to the people that need to see it &ndash; young people, to get them interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I taught for a few years and know that, for young people, the concept of 50 years is an incredible mystery. They cannot understand that there was a time when there were no mobile telephones, cars, or many of the things that, young as we are, we have seen coming on stream. The concept of something being more than 50 years old is mind-boggling to them. I once taught a girl to play the piano. I asked her how old the piano was and she asked if it was older than me. I replied <Col N="1430" /> that it was much older than me, to which she replied that it must be about 40. The piano was made in 1843 which was way beyond her comprehension. It is not easy to bring the concept of 100 or 200 years to children, but there is scope to do it.</P>
    <P>Housing artefacts locally means people who come to Dublin do not see those artefacts relevant to different counties, but that is not the terrible disaster many may think. An example is the Greencastle Maritime Museum. For years we knew of ships from the Spanish Armada which had sunk off the Donegal coast at Kinnegoe Bay, many of whose artefacts have been removed by divers, including my uncle. People fought for years to have the artefacts housed in Greencastle in the Inishowen peninsula. The argument against it at the time was that artefacts need to be preserved properly, but we have developed a facility in Greencastle in the form of a museum which would do anyone proud. The board of management and the committee have developed a museum and added a planetarium, both of which are located at the harbour. Most of the artefacts are directly linked to the sea. The success of the museum lies in its pictures of people who would have been captains of boats or who were on boats that sunk. These would be people that others would have known. There is a living quality to the museum and a tangible link with the past which people can feel. While some of the artefacts predate many generations in the area, people who visit the museum can feel a part of the history, something which touches them deeply. It is a good example of why artefacts from a region should be kept there.</P>
    <P>Letterkenny Museum has also developed well. I appreciate the money given to these facilities because, at one stage, Letterkenny suffered dry rot and the museum almost disintegrated. It has since been restored to good working order and good staff work there.</P>
    <P>While I thank the Minister for the money being spent on Grianan Fort, I am very disappointed that a few questions were raised about the staff of her Department. People in the area, like many places where there are important artefacts and historic monuments, are in love with their monument and would not have anything happen to it if they could help it. They also want to have access to the monument. As a result of improvement works, the monument had to be closed for a while with access restricted. People understood that this was in the common good. As a result of the interest shown, departmental officials met Donegal county councillors for the area. We thought we agreed what access would be allowed. Unfortunately, it appears to have changed unknown to public representatives in the area. I express my displeasure because, if we meet departmental officials, come to an agreement and sell that message to the people, it makes it difficult when things happen that are contrary to what was agreed. The people in the area are passionate about gaining access to their fort, notwithstanding <Col N="1431" /> that it was closed due to vandalism. There are people who want to care for their heritage while also having access to it. All I ask for is communication. The visitor centre contains a great deal of information on the area and I commend the staff on their work.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be familiar with Greencastle Castle. The issue there was safety, trying to ensure that people who loved their artefacts did not climb through it while searching for something they could bring home with them. Unfortunately, most of the things they might find at that location would be only modern artefacts. There are many similar places. There are also links to famous people in my area. In St. Mura's burial ground in Fahan there is a link to Florence Nightingale. Many of these are not exploited. The forts in Inch, Greencastle and Dunree and Buncrana Castle are not publicised as something unmissable. Perhaps the Minister might investigate how to divert funds to people who can best sell the message about these sites. In some cases it is a lack of knowledge and in others people deliberately stay away from their heritage and links to important people.</P>
    <P>I think of my home town in that regard. About 200 yards from my house is the home place of General Montgomery. I recall speaking with a former British Ambassador who said that he was quintessenatially British and not Irish. If one were to go to Moville and look for his house or his parents' graves, no fuss would be made. The house is falling in. I would say that there is an advantage to having someone from the local area who became important, for whatever reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>He was Bishop Montgomery and he left a great estate to the people of the town which is why we have one of the best walks in the country. It is politically incorrect to celebrate many things we could celebrate. That needs to be addressed and we must accept that it is a divergence of background which created us. It is by accepting the past that we can progress into the future.</P>
      <P>There are locations which need to be developed. We heard this morning on the Marian Finucane show about Malin Head being the warmest place last year with the best sunshine and all such positive things. However, it is a focal point which is not developed. It is the most northerly point and must have seen much down the years. Despite this, nothing is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> I would like to see within the heritage area education and tourism potential being developed. Apart from anything else, many of the artefacts housed in museums provide an indoor facility which is not weather dependent. No matter how inclement the weather, people can find something to look at. That is one of the advantages of museums, such as the Greencastle Museum. People can spend time there and make a link with the past.</P>
    <P>Often displays, the presentation of artefacts and the marketing of museums are not good. One still thinks of museums as dark, dull, boring places when they are not. A new initiative needs to be taken in the marketing of museums. No matter how many artefacts are gathered, if people are not interested in seeing them, we are going nowhere. Perhaps the Minister would discuss with the Departments of Education and Science, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Marine and Natural Resources ways of working together to develop the potential which is not being exploited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred earlier to a matter that touches on our links to Scotland. A lot is happening now in relation to those links, particularly Scotland-Donegal links. With the setting up of the Scottish-Irish forum a lot of interaction is beginning to occur on a political level and I assume the Minister will be able to advance the development of the heritage links of all the people who left Donegal and had a second home in Scotland. There is massive potential there.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate to have an uncle who is extremely interested in history. He could talk anybody under the table in relation to Scottish-Irish links as he has done a lot of research on the topic &ndash; that relates to what Deputy Deasy mentioned. Many of the people who have carried out research and who had a great interest in folklore and Irish history have died and much of what they had to say was never recorded, collected or presented in a way useful for the future. If one of the £250,000 allocations for an artefact was given to a county, even if only on a couple of counties a year basis, it could be spent on employing someone to go round and meet the characters and pool together some of the stories.</P>
    <P>My regret is that there is so much happening and yet nothing seems to be done. Almost every village has a historian or a local history group which meets weekly in a hotel room or bar, but their stories are not getting out to the people who would enjoy hearing them. We should try to ensure there is one person in each county to develop those stories.</P>
    <P>Leader and other groups assist county councils and tidy towns organisations take seriously the development and the heritage of their towns. We need co-ordination and maybe that could be organised through the schools. Perhaps we could initiate school projects, in primary schools in particular, to encourage people to examine the heritage of their areas. The only topic I remember <Col N="1433" /> hearing about from my primary school days is the Vikings. If we had been taken around our area to see the local monastery and high cross we would have remembered a lot more. Now years on I know as little as I did when I went to school about the heritage closest to me. Some initiative in the primary school area would be welcome and would bring a lot of our heritage to life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to artefacts causing problems in relation to developments and said that developers might not mention matters so that their development can proceed. A couple building a house might find a standing stone and be set back many months. That problem arose in relation to the development of an Alzheimer's unit in Carndonagh. The finding of the standing stone has left everything else outstanding for a considerable time. There is a proliferation of historical sites and artefacts throughout the country and we cannot develop everything. It is a tough decision as to what should be excavated or when an artefact should be photographed and moved to a more suitable location.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to speak on the Heritage Fund Bill without referring to one of my closest constituents, Mr. Brian Friel. We now have a Brian Friel archive in the National Library. I do not need to explain the wonders of the works and the significance of his plays throughout the world. It is important that there are incentives for people like him. I welcome the tax credit system that will help in the preservation of heritage. People can get tax credit for the archive material they contribute. Brian Friel has contributed a lot to putting material down on paper.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the £10 million funding. We have probably spent more time complaining about what is not being done than in welcoming the funding. It is good to use the opportunity to express our interest in this particular subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I welcome the making available of additional funding for heritage, which is badly needed. However, I was disappointed with the restrictive nature of the Bill. Funding is restricted to items of more than £250,000 and to the acquisition of items such as paintings and items of historic value. They will be housed almost totally in the institutions listed in the Bill. Beside Leinster House we have probably the greatest display of artefacts in any capital in the world and it is unfortunate that more of our people cannot have access to them with reasonable comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the council is almost totally associated with the institutions listed, the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery, the National Archives and so on. The directors of those institutions are to be the members of the council. Human nature being what it is, their interests will be focused on their own institutions and the rest of the country will gain little. The £10 million which will be made <Col N="1434" /> available over a period of five years is wonderful. If, for instance, there is a sum of £3 million to be spent this year, have the directors identified items on which this sum may be expended in the short period of time left in the current year, about two months? If so, that is a short time and I hope that preparations are made and the items earmarked for purchase are available. If some of the funding is left unspent in the current year, it returns to the Minister for Finance to invest until it is needed again &ndash; if I read it correctly. If such funding, £10 million, is available then it should be used more widely to purchase artefacts at a national level to be available throughout the country instead of being centred in Dublin to be seen by visitors from Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as stated here.</P>
    <P>I disagree when the Minister says in the explanatory memorandum that the heritage fund will have no direct impact on rural communities. If a valuable item in a rural community needs to be purchased, where will it spend the rest of its days? I see the Minister shaking her head. Can she tell me what provision is made for an important artefact to remain within or near to the community? An exhibition of major paintings, for example, will go on display in Cork or Limerick but rarely in Galway because it has no museum of the standard to house such works safely. That is why, when I first heard of this fund, I hoped that a portion of it would be used to establish museums throughout the country. Yet the Bill restricts it to items which the Minister considers to be of great value. There is no spin off to the rest of the country's heritage. If what I say is incorrect, I accept that.</P>
    <P>There are two examples of a rich heritage which I have failed to persuade the Minister or her colleagues to recognise as important or to help the local communities. One is the historical Portumna Castle where the Office of Public Works has done a fine, but limited, restoration job. Adjacent to the castle is Portumna forest park and it is possible for Coillte to donate this land to her Department so as to integrate it into the castle heritage complex as the castle and walks complement each other. The other example &ndash; and I am sure that the Minister like other local representatives has received representation about it &ndash; is Coole Park. There an abundance of heritage is threatened by the National Roads Authority's developing of the N18 right in front of its entrance. As a matter of urgency, I hope that the Minister and Dúchas will do all in their power to limit the impact of the proposed dual carriageway. If allowed to proceed as planned, it will destroy a beautiful heritage site and the easy access which people now enjoy would disappear. We all accept the necessity of progress, but the impact this would have on an important heritage site must be considered and an alternative found. The many people who love Coole Park and all it stands for would appreciate that. It is an important tourist attraction in an area with few attractions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Can anything be done about releasing back to their localities the vast quantity of different artefacts stored out of sight in various buildings, some of which are inappropriate, in Dublin? They serve no function by occasionally being displayed, usually on request. I hope that the Minister will do something through the unallocated funds in the proposed five years about important material that is locked in the archives.</P>
    <P>I have tried hard to find the location of the Book of Duniry, an important artefact from my own parish in County Galway. It is an historical book which I cannot trace. It does not appear to be in the State and may be lost. If it is outside Ireland, I am sure the Minister could repatriate it, even temporarily, and put it on display in the county. Such works on display at local or county level would enthuse young people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney mentioned education. There is no better way to encourage young people to appreciate the artefacts we have in Ireland than to bring people to them. The opportunity that so many have to visit Dublin to see the National Museum, National Library and other sites may be beyond reach due to time or expense for some. When I was in the classroom, I usually brought a school tour to Dublin once a year to see Leinster House, the National Museum, the National Art Gallery and the National History Museum. Those trips had a lasting impression on the minds of those who attended and they appreciated the opportunity to see artefacts first hand. Many were studying art and it was important for them to appreciate real works of art. Many developed a life long appreciation from that. Perhaps some of the unspent funding from any of the five years could be utilised to bring items of importance to rural areas even on a once-off basis. I accept that it is expensive and a difficult job.</P>
    <P>I disagree when the Minister says that this would have no impact on rural communities. It has a serious impact if such items are found and then taken out of local areas because many such items have been taken and have never been brought back. Some of the younger generation would never have seen important artefacts from their own areas. Such an item might be mentioned in a local history but people will not know how to find it or identify it. They are more <i>au fait</i> with the most recent arrival in the wax museum than they are with items of important heritage value from their own area. That is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on our national broadcaster to address this matter. The national television station should realise that these items should be frequently shown. There have been occasional excellent programmes but they are all too infrequent. Lyric FM and its impact on bringing classical music to the people is a fine example of what can be done. The same could be done in an educational way to bring heritage to the schools and the public at large. It would reinvigorate enthusiasm for heritage.</P>
    <P>While many would say that our heritage has <Col N="1436" /> been destroyed, Dúchas has done a fantastic job in the area of preservation. While Duchas at times impedes progress, we depend on it as our national heritage organisation to protect what is there and what we can now identify. It has done a tremendous job in identifying heritage sites. Perhaps it has gone overboard in preserving anything and everything but without its efforts, much would be lost. We must compliment Dúchas on its achievements. I plead with the Minister to lift the restrictive nature of this Bill to allow for some expenditure on access to heritage for those outside Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001. I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and for setting up a heritage fund for the protection and purchase of important artefacts. It is a worthwhile Bill. Much of our heritage, both urban and rural, has been lost over time through one accident or another. It is vital that we protect both structures and artefacts in any way possible.</P>
      <P>Members have argued that the number of sites listed in the register of national monuments could be an impediment to development. There is some case that could be made in that regard, and some structures such as lime kilns have been well documented. Many have been bulldozed during farm development, rightly or wrongly. When it comes to redeveloping those areas, planning authorities are taking a very rigid view. Pressure is being put on young couples who must get archaeologists to write expensive reports on these issues. If the precise location of these sites was documented instead of the listing of a general area, it would be easier.</P>
      <P>However, we must ensure that the heritage that exists in abundance around Ireland is maintained and preserved as far as possible. I encourage the Minister, in conjunction with wider education strategies, to help schools to use their own local history as a subject. Older people in a townland or area may have a history of the artefacts, churches, ruins and monuments of an area and I dread to think that much of this will be lost for coming generations. When current primary pupils grow up, will they have the same breadth of knowledge about rural landscapes and urban streetscapes as past generations? I visited several national schools last week as part of National Children's Day and saw that teachers were displaying large maps of their locality which showed the location of standing stones, lime kilns, old roads and other points of interest. I hope that this progress is built upon and that local history is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across another matter recently when researching for planning permission and trying to find the old ruins of a penal church. The book <i>Where the Arglen So Gently Flows</i> by J.J. O'Riordan not alone contains the national monuments but also the folklore. Everyone has heard stories about the fairy forts and the little people associ<Col N="1437" /> ated with them but in the two chapters of folklore in the book it is fascinating to read of the vivid imagination of the people at that time. I suppose the folklore was a source of entertainment and irrespective of whether these stories are true, the book is a fascinating read. If such documents are out there it is up to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to preserve them and this Bill is a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a few specific issues. When people know of the existence of artefacts in attics or wherever, should they bring it to the attention of the Department and the national fund when it is in place? We have an impressive depth of knowledge in the National Museum, the National Archives and the other State cultural institutions, but we should all be on the look out for artefacts that are out there and should be protected.</P>
    <P>A nation's greatest asset is its heritage and it must be protected. In developing farming in the 1960s and the 1970s the old ring forts, fairy forts and lime kilns were bulldozed to make way for what was seen as more important than mere relics of past heritage. The same was true of thatched houses and older buildings while new houses were seen as far better. Today we have gone back to the position where dated is <i>in vogue</i> and people are trying to reinvent the past. This is happening not alone in housing but in Irish pubs around the world where our heritage is being acknowledged. Old thatched or stone houses that have survived are now considered treasures, and I hope this trend continues.</P>
    <P>A number of developments have taken place during this Government's lifetime. A fund was set up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for the conservation of the structure of old houses. It is easy to claim the amount of money should be much higher but it is certainly a help to get a £10,000 grant or up to 50% of the cost of maintaining the structure in its original form and, as such, is very welcome. I saw an example of this in Banteer in my constituency where a house that was used as a calving shed and was going to be knocked is now a beautiful two bedroom cottage which is let during the summer and creates an income for the farm family. In many towns and villages people with great imagination and determination have bought vulnerable derelict buildings either alone or as part of a group with the intention of restoring them. I pay a particular compliment to the Minister for the way she has helped us maintain the beautiful original stonework in the Banteer heritage centre and in the old school which is now a theatre in Charleville. It is wonderful that the State and the Minister sees fit to fund such projects.</P>
    <P>I urge the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of Education and Science to bring this matter to the attention of young people. My generation would certainly disregard it and say we are looking to the future and not to the past. There was an old saying that if one does not know from where one <Col N="1438" /> came there is a very good chance that one does not have a clue where one is going. I think the majority of people have a good knowledge of the Early Christian times in this country and the Viking invaders as there are many monuments left from that period. We have some artefacts from the Bronze Age and if there are others out there they should be maintained. We do not have the full history of an folach fiadh. We know it was located on the side of marshy land and it provided for some type of cooking but there is still much to explore in this area.</P>
    <P>It is frightening that even to this day with all the education and attempts to preserve our heritage, some of it is still being torn up in the dead of night. Although they may not relate to the distant past, I do not believe there are any forges remaining apart from places such as Muckross House in Killarney. They should be preserved as they would be a tourist attraction. It was pointed out to me recently that we have much information on post-medieval history but in 100 years' time will people still have that information and should we be encouraged to maintain what we see today throughout the countryside?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it before the House. It was a commitment in the programme for Government and I am pleased to see that honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this very important Bill. It is important to establish this fund of £10 million for the acquisition of artefacts of significant importance which will be available to the main State cultural institutions. I hope what is acquired by the main institutions will be available for loan to various regional centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe £3 million will be made available this year, and £2 million will be available in each of the two following years with a final payment of £1 million and since this will be a rolling fund, money not used in any one year will be carried forward which is an important aspect of the legislation. It will provide funding to five institutions, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the National Archives. I had dealings with Dr. Wallace on the O'Hara collections, of which I am sure Members are aware, and Mairead Dunleavy of whom I have to speak very highly. Listening to previous speakers I understand Dr. Wallace had some excellent documentaries on television. Those documentaries should be on film for schools. Art is not only for people in Dublin 4; it is for every village and town. Those documentaries should be available to national and second level schools. I watched a documentary on the <i>Armada</i> some weeks ago. The funds should be used to put the whole collection on film also. We are all aware of the major collectibles but many are not educated about <Col N="1439" /> them or their history. To have that available to schools would be of major benefit.</P>
    <P>Any item under consideration is required to have a valuation over £250,000. If that is the case the fund of £10 million would allow for a total acquisition of 40 items at a maximum. While all bodies have an annual acquisition budget, this sum is obviously additional to the fund which the institutions already have. If an item was on sale for £50,000, what would happen? From my experience in business I know that if a minimum floor price is put on any item, it is amazing how prices can creep in if it is known in the State that institutions have a minimum budget, particularly if the item is rare. Clearly there are opportunities to get rare acquisitions at considerably less which would be a huge addition to the State. I am not sure of the mindset behind the sum of £250,000 but being in business it seems to me that the floor price could be lower. I am concerned that that is giving a message.</P>
    <P>All the recent purchases have been by private individuals not public bodies. In certain cases one is dealing with the public market. We are now dealing with a downturn in the economy worldwide. There is a big difference between &ldquo;for auction&rdquo; and &ldquo;for sale&rdquo;. Deputy Ring, who is an auctioneer, will confirm this. At present everything is for sale, while two years ago everything was for auction. The difference is that for auction ten people are looking for the same item while for sale means one is in the marketplace. The definitions of &ldquo;for auction&rdquo; and &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; on the minimum floor value should be defined differently. If collectibles are for sale as opposed to for auction it means that the floor price could be considerably lower. I ask the Minister to look at that. It is not only people in the collectible business but dealers who collect manuscripts and books all over the world. For example, I bought the <i>Book of Ballymote </i>12 months ago<i>. </i>The <i>Book of Ballymote</i> is a facsimile which&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not say that. I was delighted to bring the <i>Book of Ballymote </i>back to Ballymote. It is only the facsimile. The original <i>Book of Ballymote</i> is in the Royal Irish Academy. I thank Siobhán O'Rafferty who allowed transparencies to be taken of the four best illustrated pages of the book. The facsimile of the <i>Book of Ballymote</i> will shortly go on display in Ballymote. The transparencies are well illustrated on canvas. This facsimile which came in from Holland was published in 1887 while the original book was published in Ballymote in the 1300s. As Deputy Ulick Burke said, the original book is in the Royal Irish Academy since 1785. The lack of knowledge on the <i>Book of Ballymote</i> even in Ballymote is amazing. I am hoping to correct that in some small way. The facsimile book cost £2,500 and even at that time it was a considerable invest<Col N="1440" /> ment. I believe it is increasing in value at the rate of 30% per annum. One could pay considerably more for the facsimile book of which there are only a few copies. In certain counties, Clare, Sligo and Donegal, massive collectibles could be acquired which would be a huge asset to this fund as opposed to acquiring 40 items for £10 million. One could get 100 items of a distinctive collection which could be on sale in Europe.</P>
      <P>I was in contact with a Dr. Stewart Neadon, Curator, Bronze Age Celtic Art, in the British Museum. There is a huge Sligo gold collection on display in London as we speak. I wish to draw to the Minister's attention one item, the Curry Torc, a pure gold necklace dating back to the Bronze Age 2,500 years ago, which was unearthed in Curry in the 1850s. That gold necklace is on display in the Bronze Age Celtic Art Studios at Great Russell Street, London. Dr. Stewart Neadon indicated that they would be disposed to talking to the Minister with a view to having it on loan. The significance of the Curry Torc to Sligo would be a real treasure. Perhaps this possibility could be examined by the Minister's officials. Sligo gold, which was unearthed in the 1800s, and a great deal of Irish gold is on display in the British Museum. If possible, I suggest that gold should be returned, under stringent controls, and put on display.</P>
      <P>A collection that is dear to me is the O'Hara Collection of carriages which was given to State in 1952 by Dermot O'Hara, Annamore Estate. It is an unique collection of seven carriages, Bianconi carriages, all of which are different styles. It is our intention to have those returned to Sligo. However, considerable money will have to be spent on their conservation and restoration to put them into an exhibition. Will the Minister indicate if and when funds are available for such work? </P>
      <P>My predecessor, Ted Nealon, was the first Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in 1985. I am open to correction but I understand he appointed Mr. Justice Hamilton as chairman of an advisory committee. He had great vision at that time. It has now become a huge Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning artifacts to their place of origin is important. During the summer the President opened the Niland Gallery. We are fortunate for Nora Niland's wisdom in regard to the Jack Yeats collection. They were indebted to the missionaries who compiled a wonderful collection of Yeats paintings, which is a real treasure for Sligo. The Niland Gallery was part funded by the Minister's Department. I will shortly visit Turlough House in Castlebar. It is a wonderful concept which brings history back to the people and the regions. As speakers said earlier today, the National Museum is considered elitist and people feel it is not for them. Bringing artefacts back to where they originated is a wonderful concept. Sligo is fortunate to have a very rich heritage, particularly in regard to Jack and W.B. Yeats. This week a Belfast company published a book listing items <Col N="1441" /> for sale, including manuals, booklets, all distinctive and collectable items. The Minister should provide some funding for smaller items which will be collectibles in the future. From small acorns large oaks grow and I am sure the Minister will invest wisely. The purchase of the <i>Ulysses</i> collection amounting to more than £1.4 million was a valuable acquisition for the State. The Minister was successful in acquiring fine paintings for the National Art Gallery and I recognise that this is free of charge.</P>
    <P>It is now time to bring fine arts to the people. I am not sure if that will be possible from a security point of view but, given the appreciation of art, nothing is impossible. There is a fine arts studio in Sligo where artists have open evenings. People genuinely appreciate the library collections which people visit in their own regions. Such fine displays may not be fully appreciated in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The provision of £10 million in the Bill for the acquisition of further objects of heritage is important. Every county has a rich heritage. Dúchas has done outstanding work in Ballymote Castle which is open to the public after 20 years. This is much appreciated. Much has been done in regard to the acquisition of items and it is now time to promote these collections. Turlough House has been advertised on the national airwaves. There should be such advertisements in regard to Dublin. It is important to promote this business. The bringing of collectibles from Ireland to London is also important.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the Hamilton report recommended by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton to the then Minister, Mr. Ted Nealon, and the White Paper on Culture, Access and Opportunity. The new legislation will seek to introduce an effective licensing system governing the export of works of art and a wide range of material over 50 years old. This includes furniture, silver, glass, including stained glass, musical instruments, porcelain, books above a specified value, archives, including sound, photographic archives and so on. It is a matter of regret that so much time has elapsed between the Government White Paper, the Hamilton report and the introduction of the Bill, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of establishing a heritage fund to acquire and preserve important items of heritage. I am sure the Minister would be the first to recognise that there are fantastic heritage groups throughout the country who are visionary and give of their time to provide lectures and publications on a shoestring budget. We have come a long way in the past ten or 12 years. The role of the National Museum, the National Gallery, the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Concert Hall, the Chester Beatty Library and the Director of the National Archives is very important in regard to the collectibles stored in Dublin. Sligo has received approval in principle for considerable funding for a museum, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The development in Mayo is welcome because it will bring collectibles back to the people. I <Col N="1442" /> appeal to the Minister to bring art back to the younger generation. Deputy McGinley covered many aspects in his statement this morning and I compliment him on his observations on the Bill. The use of the fund to acquire important items is very important. Section 6 of the Bill refers to a gift of land or other property which the Minister may on the advice of the Council of National Cultural Institutions accept for the benefit of the heritage fund. The Minister should consider tax concessions in regard to gifts to the State. There are very fine collections in private hands. People should get tax concessions if they give the State collections for public display. It is important to keep a catalogue of items of national interest in private ownership.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to speak on this important issue and I appeal to the Minister to consider a lower limit of £250,000. Perhaps £1 million of the £10 million could be designated to items of less than £250,000 in value. This would provide a great opportunity to acquire items of significant importance to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. The Labour Party spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1443" /> Reform, Deputy O'Sullivan, stated in the debate last night that the Labour Party will support this Bill which was drafted by the National Parents and Siblings Alliance. The alliance is to be complimented on bringing forward this very worthy Bill which is underpinned by fundamental principles relating to the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with a disability. The Bill seeks to secure the fair, simple and speedy resolution of complaints relating to infringements of those rights. Central to the Bill is the appointment of a disability commissioner to investigate complaints against service providers. An exciting concept in the Bill is the establishment of a disability advocacy service. The Bill also provides for a code of disability rights and for the assessment by health boards of the needs of persons with a disability in accordance with the provisions of the code of disability rights. If implemented the code would lead to considerable improvements in the rights of persons with a disability and the vindication of those rights.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, wants to go further and guarantee the</P>
      <P>rights of persons with a disability to full participation in society by proposing an amendment to the Constitution. The Government has failed to deliver in the provision and vindication of rights of persons with a disability. After almost four and a half years we are still awaiting the promised comprehensive disabilities Bill, while it has rejected the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The National Parents and Siblings Alliance has taken an important initiative in drafting the Bill which is obviously the product of much thought, hard work and professional drafting. In its amendment to the motion for a second reading the Government dismisses the Bill on the basis that it proposes bringing forward legislative proposals which will be wider in scope than those contained in the Bill before the House. The Minister will understand why I treat this commitment with the utmost scepticism. The amendment in effect attacks the National Parents and Siblings Alliance by rejecting the Bill as being based on a philosophy of segregation and separation of people with disabilities and not taking full account of the policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities. Does the Minister, the Government, Fianna Fail and PD backbenchers and the Independent Deputies who support the Government really believe what is contained in the amendment, which is designed to insult and offend rather than unify in the interests of all persons with a disability? I think not. It is not too late for the Government to allow the Bill pass Second Stage tonight and it could be amended on Committee Stage. What has the Government to fear in doing this if it is really going to produce a superior Bill during its lifetime which will be passed into law before the next general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the National Parents and Siblings Alliance on bringing forward the Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill, 2001. This Bill was born of profound frustration over decades with failures by Governments to give full recognition to people with disabilities and to provide the essential services they deem necessary. We see this from a brief glance at the national disability database compiled by Fiona Mulvaney which gives excellent information on the 26,760 people with intellectual disabilities. Four and a half years after the Government took office there are still 806 people in psychiatric hospitals in inappropriate accommodation and nearly 500 people receiving no service of any kind, which is shameful. One third of all those over 35 years with an intellectual disability will have major needs in the period up to 2006. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, nearly 17% of children and adults with intellectual disability have no service. Because of these figures I sat here last night in disbelief listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, telling people with disabilities, who have struggled for decades, that there was no hope and that she would not accept the Bill, which she flung back in their faces and in the faces of their parents and carers. It is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>I refer to carers of people with disabilities. As my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, correctly indicated the Labour Party policy, <i>Yours by Right</i>, points out the need for a constitutional amendment on disability rights. We also need a constitutional amendment to copperfasten the rights of carers. We must have a needs assessment for carers and abolish the disgraceful and hated means test for carer's allowance. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, has had five years to get rid of this means test with regard to these heroic people who 24 hours a day, seven days a week, look after people with severe disabilities. However, the Government has not abolished the means test. Fianna Fáil will shortly answer to the electorate who will take a very severe view of its betrayal of carers and people with disability as evidenced again tonight by the failure to adopt this modest Bill introduced by Deputy Fitzgerald and which my colleague Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked us to develop.</P>

The Government has brought in seven Bills already and will introduce a Bill which will go far beyond the suggestion the Opposition has made. They would be far better to listen to what is going on than to be shouting misinformation across the House. They have nothing to contribute. They have been an opposition in a coma for the past four years. They have nothing positive to say and they try to drag down someone who is trying to do a fine job in this particular Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Government intends to do as outlined in the House. The Government is putting together a Bill that will go a long way to ensuring that people with disabilities will have access and participation at all levels of society. They will be given real physical access to public services and public buildings. The Government will put in place procedures to monitor the implementation of this Bill. It will ensure that the rights of those with disabilities are enshrined in the Bill <Col N="1448" /> and that we are able to build on the work the Minister has undertaken in the past four years.</P>
    <P>There are specific parts of this Bill from which I have been diverted due to Deputy Broughan's remarks but I want to highlight the fact that there is a need to ensure that we have proper access for all. That can be based on transport, the development of e-government and e-commerce. Building on the achievements of this Government, it will bring forward its own disabilities Bill. This will give those who are physically or psychologically challenged a proper platform to participate and gain access to every level of society, including physical access to Government buildings and participation in employment. Access is part and parcel of what this Bill is all about. I support the direction the Government is taking and I support what the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, has been doing in her Department.</P>

      <P>I have been in this House for the past four years and many worthwhile Private Members' Bills have been presented to the House in that period. They have been well crafted and well thought through. I compliment the National Parents and Siblings Alliance for helping to craft this Bill. It is an excellent Bill in its own way, but it is very narrowly focused. What the Government proposes to do in its own disability Bill will be far more wide ranging and will do what the policy of this Government in its legislative programme has set out from the beginning.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be drawn on a side issue, but it is somewhat rich of Deputy Broughan to complain about this Government. I was not here, but he was part of the Rainbow Coalition that drew up two Bills that were found to be unconstitutional. It took two and a half years for this Government to rectify the mistakes made by that Government.</P>

      <P>If that had not happened, the Government disability legislation would have been advanced far earlier. I started teaching about 30 years ago and there was a special class in the school. Regrettably the special class in that school, which was a very large one, was located in a small room at the back of the assembly hall away from everybody else. A number of years later I moved on to a new school and I was teaching a student who developed muscular dystrophy. His family wanted him to remain in the mainstream education system. However, the difficulties we encountered in even getting a disabled toilet, ramps from the local authority, a disabled person's extension and need assessment, with which I totally agree and which will form part of the Bill, were not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill will inform the legislation which the Minister and her Department will bring forward. It will promote positive action and it will <Col N="1449" /> result in access for people with disability to education, health, housing, transport, etc. It is regrettable that some people who are here long enough to realise it have not addressed some of the key issues in that Bill &ndash; I particularly refer to the Fine Gael Party. It needs to be argued that this Bill will achieve what they want it to achieve and will provide a better system of care, a better system of rights and a programme of positive action for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate. I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for the focus and concentration she has brought on this area since her appointment. Clearly the Minister of State and her officials have given due consideration to the Private Members' Bill before the House. They feel there is a deficiency in the Bill and it is not sufficiently comprehensive to address the whole range of problems that people with disabilities face today.</P>
      <P>We all accept that we need to do much more than we have been doing in providing help for people with disabilities. If the Bill has a merit it is that it will provide a focus for debate on the subject. It provides the Minister and her officials with the opportunity to examine, dissect and consider the proposals contained in it. That has been done and deficiencies have been found. The Minister will bring forward her own Bill to deal in a much more comprehensive way with the whole range of issues involved.</P>
      <P>All public representatives have regular contact with people with disabilities &ndash; physical, intellectual, sensory, etc. They know at first hand the type of problems people experience in their daily lives. We must start from the point that people with disabilities are entitled to participate in the economic and social well being of the country. The changes that are necessary should be initiated immediately. While legislation is merely a beginning in terms of changes in society, many areas can be dealt with without legislation. One area I have in mind relates to access. As one who has spent some time in recent years in a state of disability, I can appreciate the importance of access to buildings, transport, etc. People who are confined to a wheelchair or who are not physically able to get around are clearly disadvantaged and are deprived of full participation in the social, economic and educational life of this country. I hope the Bill the Minister will bring forward will address comprehensively the deficiencies in this area.</P>

        <b>: </b>I am sure there are some good ideas in the Bill and that the Minister will take them on board. We also have the direction from the NPSA. I have to declare my interest in the sense that I have a daughter confined to a wheelchair. She is 17 years of age and has been confined to a wheelchair for most of her life. I am very much aware of the road blocks that exist in terms of accessibility and people with disabilities getting the recognition they deserve. People with disabilities are not looking for sympathy or hand-outs. They are looking for their rights, and it is important that the Minister's Bill is broadly based and that the views of people with disabilities are taken on board.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the frustration suffered by people with disabilities. Discos for young people are usually held downstairs and it is practically impossible for disabled people to gain access, as it is to gain access to local government buildings. The attitude of local authorities throughout the country to providing access to their buildings is shameful. I see it in my own town of Enniscorthy with Wexford County Council, and I am sure it is the same in every county. There is a lack of understanding of people with disabilities. It is important that the Minister seriously consider the views put forward from all sides of the House tonight. She is an open-minded person and I have had many discussions with her about people with disabilities. I am sure she will take some of the suggestions on board.</P>
      <P>On the 3% rate of employment, some Government offices are very good in this regard but others are not, so it is vitally important that that be included in the new Bill. It is all very well to have some kind of aspiration to reach that goal but to achieve it is proving very difficult. Some local authorities and Government bodies are not dealing with that issue in the appropriate way.</P>
      <P>The other area that is dear to my heart is VRT refunds for people who want to purchase motor cars. It is practically impossible to get access to that. Unless one fits into a box, one will not qualify. There should be some compassion from the Minister for Finance in relation to that. A person who has lost an arm or a leg should be dealt with on his or her merits and it is time that whole area was changed in the interests of people who suffer disability. I know the Minister has had a committee looking at that area for quite some time but it is important that some action is taken.</P>

It will be enacted before the next general election. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who spent most of her first year in office sorting out the two Bills the previous Government passed through the Oireachtas. They were sent to the President for signature but she refused to sign them. They were sent to the Council of State which referred them to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court sent them back here because they were unconstitutional. The Minister of State had to spend her first year in office rectifying that legislation and, in addition, enacted three other Bills in recent years, with two now coming on-stream.</P>
      <P>I do not want the word to go out from here tonight that the Government is not committed to people with disabilities. Five Acts have been passed since 1997. That is what the Minister is trying to get across, but people will not listen. They are obviously watching the audience here tonight and the public commentators. The Minister said she will bring in a comprehensive Bill which will go even further than the Bill that is before us tonight. Nobody wants to see a Bill enacted by this House which is incomplete.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me a brief opportunity to contribute to the debate tonight. As Deputy Browne said, no one here has a monopoly on wisdom in relation to this important topic. It is important that we have an opportunity to contribute to a debate on an important issue like disability, and it is good to keep the issue to the fore.</P>
      <P>The issue of disability is important and must be addressed through legislation. It is more important, however, that the legislation brought into this House is definitive, comprehensive and constitutional so that those in whose interests we are all working are given the best possible chance. We cannot be narrow in our focus. We cannot segregate those with a disability in a negative fashion. We must be informed in the legislation we promote and address the wide range of issues that go beyond health and encompass, for example, access and transport. I would be happier, therefore, to await the Minister of State's Bill which has had a wide consultation process and is to be published before Christmas. I trust the Bill will be worth the wait and that people will not be pigeonholed as disabled people merely with a health problem. It has to be holistic. The days of segregation should be gone. Inclusion must be the order of the day. I have seen great success in my constituency where children in second level schools who have a range of disabilities, including autism, are being mainstreamed and are getting the support they need from this Government.</P>
      <P>All citizens deserve adequate services and the focus of the Minister of State has been to address the deficits that have emerged over a period of time. She has been matched in her focus by other Ministers, including the Minister for Health and Children, and through the North-Western Health Board, of which I am a member. Tremendous strides have been made in the holistic approach to disability. That is not to say that everything is perfect. Far from it, but tremendous strides are being made in the lifetime of this Government. Major structural changes have occurred in terms of the delivery of disability services in the past two years. These structures must be critically assessed and, where necessary, strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the tenet of the Bill before us, and I commend all those involved in bringing it before the House tonight, it would be a poor reflection on the new organisational structures if we had to <Col N="1453" /> allocate additional moneys to buy carpets and desks to furnish yet another office. It should have been put where it belongs, into the services for those with disabilities. Had I longer to speak I would expand on the need for parents of children with special needs in north Inishowen for pre-school aids and after school integration. I would also elaborate on the tremendous work being undertaken in primary and secondary schools to deal with those with disabilities, including the</P>
    <P>crèche development outside Buncrana for those with severe disabilities where an exciting project of sheltered work is being established or support services for existing sheltered work and respite homes in Carndonagh, etc. However, these are for another day and I am proud the Government is supporting such projects. A Government disability Bill must be introduced and I look forward to it being added to the five major disability Bills already enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined last night by my colleague, the Minster of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary</P>
      <P>Wallace, the Government's forthcoming disability Bill will have a much broader focus and will impact on many of the areas that have prevented people with disabilities from participating on an equal basis in Irish life. Before dealing with the numbers involving my Department, mentioned last night, there needs to be honesty in terms of the debate. We know from our history that legislation and constitutional change on its own do not guarantee anything. We also know from the history of primary education that constitutional guarantees provided since 1937 were not adhered to for decades.</P>
      <P>The provision of services is ultimately the litmus test of any Government commitment to people with disabilities. For example, it is hard to credit that up to 1998 people with autism were not recognised as a specific category in the education system, notwithstanding a major review in 1990 involving a range of parties, both statutory and non-statutory, looking at the area of education with special needs. We need to tell people that it is dishonest to pretend that legislation or constitutional action will be a panacea. I accept that may not be the intention of those on either side of the argument but we must be clear that legislation alone never guarantees a resolution to issues of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that passing legislation establishing a legal right that is not contingent on the exigencies of the Department of Finance will benefit people with disability and that legislation that is hamstrung by the availability of financial resources&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the myth that is being propounded. Through my involvement in the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children I have experience of what is <Col N="1454" /> involved. It took this Government to decide to prioritise people with disabilities. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance introduced a new order to give disability a priority in the budgets of 1999, 2000 and 2001. We increased the level of investment in disability and accorded it priority over other areas across the health services.</P>
      <P>Decisions were taken in the Department of Education and Science in 1998 that resulted in over 1,000 additional classroom assistants and more resource teachers. That did not cost the earth and it could have been done in 1994, 1995 and 1996. It did not require legislation or constitutional amendment. It was done because we decided to do it.</P>
      <P>We know of the critical issues in the Department of Health and Children in terms of the provision of services, not only for people with disabilities but for those with mental health and the elderly. They revolve around the dearth of personnel in the paramedical area. We also know we are critically short of speech and language therapists. We could pass a law tonight guaranteeing rights to everybody for everything but that will not change tomorrow the availability of or access to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy or audiology. We must prioritise the policies&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim a monopoly of wisdom on this issue but I should be allowed make my contribution to this debate. Those groups involved in disability are aware that there are insufficient numbers of paramedics or allied health professionals to provide the services we need and want and for whom we have provided funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past 50 years there has only been one speech and language school in the country and successive Governments stand indicted on that. There has been a complete lack of planning on the manpower side. The same applies to physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last we have the wherewithal and the plan to provide enough training places to ensure there will not be shortages of these personnel. We need them to provide the services on the ground and that must be faced up to when drafting legislation. It is important that we put these issues up <Col N="1455" /> front with people and not try to pretend that we can create a panacea that will resolve everything overnight when we know that cannot happen. That is not to rule out a legislative approach but it is to give the debate a perspective which has been lacking in much of the public commentary.</P>
    <P>A number of comments were made regarding the social services inspectorate and its role in terms of services for children, etc. It is the intention to broaden its role to include services for adults with disabilities. There is significant work to be done in terms of standards and protocols to underpin that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, it must be acknowledged that by late summer the numbers of such persons was below 600 compared to 970 in 1996. Significant progress has been made on this aspect and more will be made by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <P>The number is still 600.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rainbow Coalition Government did nothing about removing people from inappropriate settings. To be fair, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance took the first significant steps by providing the money to make it possible to relocate people. The only issue delaying matters is the need to secure designs, plans and so on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reliance on community enterprise schemes in terms of personal assistance, we have liaised with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to mainstreaming the entire service. In the last budget we ring-fenced money to be made available to health boards to create additional personal assistants as part of their overall budgets for home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, the Government on the Health side has provided approximately £213 million to meet identified needs in existing services and to support the development of new services. These developments have been based on the needs identified for this group by the national intellectual disability database which is significant development. The database has provided the wherewithal to plan properly and to get into the area of multi-annual budgeting. We know of the needs and the database has been a catalyst for the increased funding that has come on-line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have established a national monitoring committee to provide a forum in which the various national partners involved in the development programme for these services are updated on a regular basis and on the progress that has been made with regard to both new and enhanced service developments. The forum is kept informed of the monitoring processes used to assess the impact of these service developments on the needs that have been identified for this <Col N="1456" /> group. It also provides the opportunity to discuss, where appropriate, areas where the committee can be of assistance to the overall implementation of the development programme. The committee is representative of the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland together with the Department, the health boards, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the Health Research Board.</P>
    <P>In relation to people with physical and sensory disabilities, additional funding amounting to £110 million has been provided to date to enhance the levels of support available. We are in the process of developing a national physical and sensory disabilities database which will become the template for proper planning of additions to services and meeting identified needs over the next number of years. We are putting a lot of investment and work into establishing that database. It is one of the most important things that can be done in terms of physical and sensory disability in the immediate future to guarantee future provisions. In terms of mental health we have made significant strides in the provision of better services across the board, particularly with the recent enactment of the Mental Health Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>If anyone were to ask me what was the single most important issue, I would have to say that it is manpower planning. We did not do it over the last number of decades. That is what we have to do now. It is more important than anything else, particularly in the areas to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Fitzgerald for bringing forward this Bill which seeks to enshrine in law the rights of those with disability. People with disabilities do not want to be pitied. They want their rights to be accepted and guaranteed by law and to secure the fair, speedy and efficient resolution of complaints relating to their rights. This Bill seeks to establish the right to an assessment of the needs and services required to fulfil their needs. The National Parents and Siblings Alliance initiated and promoted this Bill and will be disappointed that the Government has not accepted it in good faith. It could make whatever <Col N="1457" /> changes it deemed necessary on Committee Stage. I am sorry to have to say it, but the Government has missed a genuine opportunity. I will only believe it when I see the new Bill come in as promised because the Taoiseach has promised so many Bills that have not come on time.</P>
      <P>The following is an example of the problems I come across daily. The mother of an eight year old child with cerebral palsy, living in my county, has to attend Temple Street Hospital and the Central Remedial Clinic. She was delighted to receive a few pounds carer's allowance last April, not because of the money, but because it provided her with a free pass for buses. Although her husband has a reasonable income they cannot afford a car of their own because of the costs of caring for their child. Imagine the lady's disbelief when, a few weeks after being granted the carer's allowance and bus pass, she was asked to submit her husband's pay slip for the week. It was showing the national wage increase and not only was her carer's allowance removed, the bus pass was too. When this lady goes to Dublin she has to pay for the bus for herself and two children and also for a taxi to the Central Remedial Clinic. On her return she gets the free service back to the bus station that is available to Dublin based families. It is serious to have a child with cerebral palsy anywhere. The problems associated with this or any other handicap creates enormous problems for the family concerned, but if you live rurally you carry another handicap and cash burden. If you live in Dublin you get the free services, but in other areas you have to pay. I believe as do others who spoke here earlier, that means testing for the carer's allowance, especially in cases like this one, should be discontinued.</P>
      <P>We certainly need a rights culture in terms of basic rights for the disabled. There are 350,000 people with a disability. Hundreds of people are in need of the day care facilities. Thousands with physical disabilities do not benefit from activities and development. It was disturbing to read a report some months ago from the Irish Wheelchair Association on the confinement that is the daily lot of many. Many feel they are prisoners in their own homes.</P>
      <P>I want to return to a point raised by Deputy Byrne from Wexford regarding VRT. The VRT and VAT allowance must be changed and the rights of disabled people must be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to confer rights on the disabled and it is worthy of support. The Minister of State is going to vote it down, but before she does she should confirm that she is prepared to have her own Bill implemented in full at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday I visited the Irish Wheelchair Association in Belmullet. There were 20 people there and the manager is from Australia. There is pride, courage and commitment there too. Advances are being made and have been made but their rights are still not recognised. A young wheelchair bound woman was travelling by train <Col N="1458" /> from Ballina to Heuston. Upon arrival at Heuston her friend asked for somebody to help her off, but because there was nobody in attendance by the time she found a helper the train had been backed a half mile out and into a siding. She was there for an hour and a half. These things should not happen. Signs are left outside shops on streets where they are an obstacle to those who are blind or unable to see very well. Wheelchair access to public buildings is a major bone of contention.</P>
    <P>The people from the association told me they can apply for the essential repairs grant or the grant for housing under the health board schemes, but they will not be given anything to facilitate them wheeling the wheelchair around the outside of their houses. Every medical report says it is good for people to be outside in the fresh air and sunshine and to have the opportunity to move around. Yet the very grant scheme that allows for internal changes because of one's disability refuses to allow even a modicum of support for a decent footpath around even a portion of a house. That should be changed. It is discriminatory and it is just not good enough. The case regarding mobility allowance has been well made here. In order to qualify for that allowance one must go through a means test, an age test and a medical test and it must be decided by a medical officer that it is worthwhile and would be good for the person to get out of the house. Last year £1.5 million was paid out for the mobility allowance and £29 million was paid out to associated companies for subsidies for public transport which are 90% inaccessible to disabled people. That is serious.</P>
    <P>On Monday I attended the national training NTDI awards in Castlebar. They were presented by the Tánaiste. There were 200 people in attendance with different disadvantages. The Tánaiste made the very good point that this is not just an incidence of disadvantage, it is an incidence of opportunity. There were people at the ceremony suffering from diabetes and its effects, from arthritis and its effects, from wheelchair confinement and spinal injuries. They all had the outstanding achievements of their courage, pride and commitment to attaining something they did not have before, thereby progressing themselves through to certificate level, to achievement and recognition. That is all they want. They have to live inside their heads. Deputy Mary Wallace is the Minister of State. She could accept this legislation and recognise their basic rights. She could build on the legislation on her own, but because of the ways of Government people do not want to accept what is good, right and proper. I support the Bill and I ask that careful note is made of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Creed and others for the work they have done in bringing this Bill before the House last night and this evening. I read the Minister of State's remarks of last night and I say to her that she is missing a golden opportunity to take this <Col N="1459" /> issue out of the political arena once and for all. If the Minister of State accepted the Bill on Second Stage tonight, and then proceeded with her own Bill &ndash; which she states she wants published by Christmas &ndash; I would believe her. I heard her last night and read her comments afterwards and I do not think there is a chance in hell that her Bill will be before the House before Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that four years into the term of her office &ndash; let us not forget that she has direct responsibility for this matter &ndash; she utters weasel words of the kind we heard last night on what is a constructive proposal to do something significant for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I heard the exchanges of the Minister of State last night with Members of the Opposition. The fundamental part of this Bill that can make a difference is the automatic right to an assessment. We will make no progress for people with disabilities, particularly children with special needs, unless we have the fundamental right to an assessment. Then we will be able to deploy a programme of support for the person in question. Until that is accepted &ndash; it is at the heart of the Bill &ndash; we will make no progress.</P>
      <P>The Minster states that the Bill will be produced before Christmas. There is no chance that Bill will be made law before the next general election and that is the reality we are facing.</P>

      <P>I have four minutes. The Minister of State should not interrupt me. The Minister of State has shown she is not able to deal with the problem and I think it is a resigning issue. It is a resigning issue for her and other Members of the Cabinet who have been in power for the past four years and have done nothing to address the matter. That is why we are in the rut we are in.</P>
      <P>We had to drag a woman and her son through the courts in order to have her rights vindicated this year. Those are the circumstances that obtain and they are not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coming budget provides us with an opportunity to do something significant for people with disabilities. Some 75% of people with disabilities <Col N="1460" /> are dependent on social welfare as their only source of income. The current rate of disability allowance is £88.50. I want to see significant progress in the upcoming budget and the Social Welfare Bill to increase that sum to £110 or £115. That is the priority that we should establish in terms of our budgetary estimates. I wish the Minister of State and her Government would do something significant by accepting the Bill tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the Bill before the House tonight. It comes about as a result of many years of campaigning by many people with disabilities, their carers, parents and siblings. It is a direct result of work by the National Parents and Siblings Alliance. We should acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>It has been the product of those who always found themselves on the outside, always knocking on the door and begging and pleading for funding and recognition of their full rights and entitlements. It has not been easy for them, and we are all well aware of the Jamie Sinnott case in which his mother had to go to court to establish a right to education for him. Recently, another case in my constituency involved the parents of John Meehan, who went to court in July. They were attempting to establish the right to educational support for their five-year-old autistic son. They were back in court this week to get the Minister for Education and Science to acknowledge and honour the commitment he had made. That case was settled yesterday.</P>
      <P>These cases occur all the time. Rights are not recognised. Parents of children with special needs &ndash; with intellectual disabilities in the cases I have mentioned &ndash; have to bring their cases to court. That should not be the case. This Bill sets out to enshrine in our legislation a recognition that people with disabilities have rights. It is time we grew up and recognised this.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed by the amendment tabled by the Minister of State, whose speech I heard last night. If the Bill has shortcomings, why not deal with them on Committee Stage and bring it forward and facilitate the legislation? Let us not divide the House on such an issue tonight. What confidence can people with disabilities and their families have in a Government that will not recognise their proposals or accept one from the National Parents and Siblings Alliance? </P>
      <P>I refer not only to those with mental disabilities, but to people with physical disabilities. I hope the Minister of State accepts some of the points made to her in this debate. Many of us who deal with grants for disabled people and try to get special aids and facilitate the educational requirements of people with disabilities find it extremely difficult. Obstacles are put in people's way in terms of trying to get reports from occupational therapists, building surveyors and engineers. It is cumbersome and difficult and involves a great deal of red tape, which people find frustrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months pass very quickly when trying <Col N="1461" /> to achieve such things. I am aware of one case in which it has taken 18 months just to install a ground floor shower. That should not be the case. These cases should be processed efficiently and the red tape should be removed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the disabled drivers' grant has been mentioned. I have heard in this House how difficult it is to get a grant although one has to have a vehicle specially adapted or equipped. One would need to be without limbs in some cases to receive a grant, despite the fact that one is medically recognised as being disabled.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Creed and Fitzgerald for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished and disappointed at the confrontational and critical attitude of the Minister of State and Government speakers to this Bill, particularly in terms of what is left out of it. The Minister of State mentioned matters such as access to national parks and e-commerce. I am not sure if she understands how insulting this is to the disabled and their families. What bothers me most is that her position arose from a complete misunderstanding of what the Bill is about.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to establish a code of disability rights. If we had this and a commissioner to ensure the rights are enforced, then everything else of which the Minister of State spoke would follow.</P>
      <P>I hope she will not criticise me tonight if I concentrate specifically on one issue because I know my time is limited. It is the need for the mandatory assessment of needs for every single person, whether born with a disability or whether he or she has acquired one. Without this, even if we have the money and the best will in the world, how could the State ever know, plan for, or provide for the needs of the disabled? The reality is that the State cannot and does not at the moment.</P>
      <P>The services the disabled need differ and will change over their lifetimes. It is certain that if we do not have early assessment and a planned programme of services to follow, based on that assessment, then their needs will certainly be greater in later life. They will certainly be costly to the State, but more importantly, it means unrealised potential, greater disability, greater deformity, poorer health, greater dependency and a much degraded quality of life. This is the tragedy of the failure of early intervention and the absence of intensive and appropriate therapies at a young age.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Too late&rdquo; is the saddest phrase in the English language, and for many of the disabled and their families who are here tonight, and the thousands who are not here and cannot be here, it is already too late. The Minister of State heard the visitor in the gallery expressing frustration and sadness tonight for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All any of us, as parents or as a society, want for our children is that they reach their potential, and we want nothing more for our disabled children. We do not look for miracles. We do not <Col N="1462" /> want sympathy and we certainly do not want the media who dip in and out of this issue when there is an especially heartbreaking story for them. We want our children to reach their full potential and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Bill is deficient in ways, but the Minister should not ignore the fact that it establishes the priorities of the disabled and their families. She should not dismiss them and replace them with empty promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity, however brief, to support the Bill and thank the National Parents and Siblings Alliance who put a great deal of work into the preparation of its detail. Like many Members, I appeal to the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to accept the Bill and not to divide the House on it. She should table amendments instead if the Government believes additional matters need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is vital that people with disabilities are able to participate in society with rights equal to those of everyone else. Many of the measures outlined in the Bill would be important in that regard, such as the disability commissioner, the code of disability rights, the disability advocacy service and the fact that the service is independent. These are basic ideas on which the Minister could build if she accepts the Bill.</P>
      <P>Other Members have indicated various matters which have come to their attention. One matter which has come to my attention is disabled persons' grants. Unfortunately, in my constituency it takes 12 months to be assessed. Once an application is made, it will be 12 months before an occupational therapist is in a position to visit that family and assess the applicant's need.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill. Its details are important and could be built upon by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, for introducing the Bill. It covers the ground well. It is important to remember that the Government has been in office for four years. If we cast our minds back, we can recall its slogan for the previous election, which was &ldquo;People Before Politics&rdquo;. However, the performance of the Government has always been a case of politics before people, especially in the case of people with disabilities. Certainly it has been a case of economics before people with disabilities. This Thatcherite Government with its Thatcherite attitudes has always put the weakest in society to one side. That is certainly the case when one examines its reaction to those in our community with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Much could have been done with the surplus in the coffers for the weakest in society and in a wide range of areas but it was not done. It is interesting to note the reaction of the Department of Finance. One of the reasons the Bill has not been accepted is that it must first be accepted by that Department before anything can be done. It is the real power broker where the Government is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> We all have our stories about people with disabilities. Two come to mind. One relates to taxis where it is a simple matter of getting a ramp. These are things which should not pose any difficulty and, if the Bill were in place, they would go smoothly. Another concerns a constituent of mine who has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease. All the things that person needs done will not be done for a long time because it is a complicated process. The Bill will assist those people. It is long overdue and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I thank and congratulate Deputy Fitzgerald for bringing it before the House. It is an area on which I feel strongly. However, because of time limitations, I wish to concentrate on one area of disability, namely, autism.</P>
      <P>Kathy Sinnott, the mother of Jamie Sinnott, has not only highlighted through High Court and Supreme Court cases the glaring inadequacy of the system for dealing with the growing problem of autism, she has also appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science to outline how much work needs to be done to put a structured system in place to treat children and babies affected by autism and other disabilities in a proper and civilised manner.</P>
      <P>Since the disgraceful Government decision to appeal the Jamie Sinnott judgment, we have heard statements from the Minister for Education and Science expressing real commitment to putting in place an educational structure for autistic children and adults. He has made the infamous blank cheque book claim on a number of occasions, giving the parents of autistic children some hope that attitudes and resources available from Government would change for the better in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>There is an urgency to get legislation passed by the House that contributes to instilling much needed belief that we as legislators are serious about addressing disabilities in law. There is no guarantee in the Constitution, in law or in practice that people with disabilities will get an equal opportunity to be educated, to maximise their potential and to live as close to normal lives as they possibly can. The Bill is straightforward legislation seeking to establish one substantive right, namely, the right in law to an assessment of needs and to the services that will follow from that assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, it is the National Parents and Siblings Alliance which has drafted this legislation and we in Fine Gael support it in an attempt to have it accepted in the House. There are many positive aspects to the legislation and I do not understand why the Government has insisted on rejecting it. I do not accept its reasons for rejection, namely, that it will bring forward more comprehensive legislation soon. It has had four years to introduce legislation in this area and has not done so. There is nothing to stop the <Col N="1464" /> Government adding to the legislation, should it wish to, on Second or Committee Stages to make it more comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The principles of the Bill are good: a disability commissioner's office to ensure early assessment, a code of disability rights, the promotion of education, publicity in respect of the observance of the rights of persons with a disability, investigation of breaches of the code of rights and the taking of legal proceedings, if necessary, to pursue them. These are principles no one could or should reject. I am disappointed the Government has chosen to divide the House, especially as I believe the Minister of State has a genuine desire to address the issues of disability.</P>
    <P>With each day that passes that we do not act to put legal structures in place to improve services to parents and their children, another child develops autism who could have been intercepted. Another family's life is turned upside down. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was right when he said that passing legislation today will not make an immediate impact in practice tomorrow, but surely it is the right place to begin. If there is a law, the services must follow, and that is the guarantee parents want and demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill and I compliment Deputy Fitzgerald on bringing it forward. She has been a great and long time campaigner for the rights of the disabled down the years. As someone who worked with special children on a voluntary basis, I know full well their needs and requirements. No amount of money could be put in place to help people with disabilities and their families. The growth we experienced in the past four years provided the funding which should have been given to people with disabilities and to services for them. Before then the money was not there but it is there now and should be provided.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an honest attempt to address the real needs of people with a disability and that is why the Minister should accept it. In the aftermath of the Sinnott case Government promises came thick and fast. The Minister promised a disabilities, education and training Bill which we have not yet seen and he promised to recruit 70 additional psychologists to assist in removing bottlenecks in needs assessment. None has been recruited to date. The Government announced the establishment of the special needs education forum to contribute to the elements which will make up the State's comprehensive response to the needs of people with disabilities. The first meeting was to be held in September but it has not happened to date. The action programme for the millennium promised much. It said that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates, were comprehensively addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy is based on the core principles of <Col N="1465" /> promoting empowerment through appropriate accessible and responsive services. Despite the commitments given by the Government, very little has been done. That point is graphically illustrated by the fact that in 1999, three years after its publication and acceptance by Government, 80% of the report's recommendations remained unfulfilled. There are major difficulties in a large number of areas at the moment. Respite care for carers and parents of disabled children is not available.</P>

      <P>I wish to reiterate what my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, said here last evening. The Government is committed to legislation in this area that will underpin greater participation by people with disabilities in our society. This means giving people with disabilities the same opportunities to participate as are enjoyed by the rest of our citizens and avoiding the old philosophy of separation and segregation for the disability sector. The Government will, therefore, bring forward legislation in a new disabilities Bill that has as its hallmark the attainment of equality by our citizens who have a disability. The approach of the Government, in line with the progress already made in facilitating equality driven, positive action measures, will ensure that we have legislation that will underpin the participation, not the segregation, of people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to denigrate the efforts of others in this field. Indeed, I applaud the work of the National Parents and Siblings Alliance which <Col N="1466" /> published its own proposals last July. I consider, however, that the approach in those proposals is inadequate in terms of the limited scope of the proposals. The Fine Gael Bill before us this evening, on the other hand, offers nothing new, nothing that can usefully be adopted. It is an exercise first and foremost in opportunism, taking some of the thought and content of the National Parents and Siblings Alliance's proposals and presenting them as their own in this Bill, as if it were some exercise in original thought, but which will not add one iota to the attainment of recognition and equality for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The traditional provision of services for people with disabilities was designed on a segregated basis which catered for different groups of people with disabilities in specialised institutions. The policy of this Government in relation to disability matters is based on the premise that disability is a social rather than a medical issue and the recognition of equality as a core principle in our approach to policy formulation.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us tonight totally fails to recognise the progress made in relation to disability policy over the last four years. It appears to me to be an opportunistic ploy on behalf of Fine Gael to exploit an emotive issue and to make a political football out of disability.</P>

      <P>While Fine Gael has cynically &ldquo;harrowed&rdquo; the thrust of the Bill produced by the parents and sibling group, too lazy to formulate its own policies, the Government has been working hard on a comprehensive disabilities Bill and as my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Wallace, has outlined, we are well on the way to meeting our target of producing this wide ranging Bill before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind everyone here tonight that before this Government took office there was no comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in this jurisdiction which prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities. Since then, we have enacted the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, which together with the equality infrastructure, the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director for Equality Investigations which has been put in place to give effect to the legislation, are regarded <Col N="1467" /> by some commentators as the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Government's approach to disability is based on the concept of equality for all. The measures to be covered in the Government's new disabilities Bill will be proactive in nature and will require all Departments and State agencies to participate in initiatives to advance and underpin the inclusion of people with disabilities. It seems the Fine Gael proposal to set up a disability commissioner, for example, immediately segregates people with disabilities from the wider community and does nothing to enhance equality for all in our country.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that those across the floor have no confidence in Irish citizens with disabilities and believe the old way of treating people with disabilities differently from the rest of the population, with separate institutions, is the best way. I am glad that l belong to a Government with confidence in Irish people with disabilities and who believe it is our duty to provide the opportunities, based on equality, to allow all our fellow citizens to participate as equals in Irish society and to have the opportunity of reaching their potential.</P>

Our philosophy in relation to equality for people with disabilities is to remove barriers where they exist and to provide supports where they are needed. The Government's disabilities Bill will, of course, deal with certain matters that are the subject of the present Bill, including the assessment of needs of people with disabilities and the provision of related services.</P>

    <P>I am shocked by that contribution by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is shameful. I have always said that the heart of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, was in the <Col N="1468" /> right place but her Government has let her down. I cannot understand why she cannot accept the main principle of this Bill. I know now that the senior Ministers in the Cabinet have a different clientele that they want to look after. That clientele is obviously not the disabled. What I heard from the Minister a few minutes ago is shameful.</P>

      <P>We shall see. The Government had four years to do it and it is only now, before the general election, that it is winding up for it and then it will be shelved. This is possibly the most important debate we have had in the House in the past four years. All disabled persons, irrespective of their disability, are entitled to be treated as equal citizens. The Jamie Sinnott case will never be forgotten in any part of Ireland where the carers of the disabled meet. They know what this Government did when they had the opportunity to do better.</P>
      <P>What must these carers think when, at the time when this economy was at its best, they only just got on a little better than previously? What will happen if there is a downturn in the economy? The principle of this Bill is so important because, irrespective of what happens, the disabled will be looked after. It will not be based on whether there is money in the Exchequer or on the ups and downs of the economy. This Bill aims to ensure that their fundamental rights are looked after.</P>
      <P>There are huge deficits around the country in services to the disabled. In Ballinasloe there are many families who do not seem able to get the support to which they are entitled. That the carers never get a respite must be a fundamental matter that can be addressed reasonably easily, but still there are those in Ballinasloe and east Galway who never get a break. I have heard nothing from the Government side which leads me to believe things will get better. This Government will be judged on how it handles this tonight. It is interesting to see the Progressive Democrats and the independents arriving to vote. On other occasions they stood up for what they thought was right.</P>

        <b>:</b> I express on my own behalf and that of the Socialist Party, our solidarity with the organisations championing the rights of the disabled who brought this Bill forward. I pledge my support for it. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the appointment of &ldquo;a disability commissioner to investigate complaints against persons or bodies who provide health or disability services and to provide for the promulgation of a code of disability rights and for the assessment by health boards of the needs of persons with a disability in accordance with the provisions of that code,&rdquo; and so on. How can the <Col N="1469" /> Government oppose that? The sad reality is that we have a Government which promised a disability Bill on numerous occasions and yet, in the dying days of this Dáil, we have yet to see it. That is a scandal.</P>
      <P>An ominous note is struck by the Department of Finance which said &ndash; and this has probably been quoted already &ndash; that it &ldquo;cannot accept recommendations which imply the underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as a right. This right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer&rdquo; and so on. As we enter a period when the Government will say that belts must be tightened and the Exchequer results are not as good as was thought, we can expect people with disabilities to be neglected again. This is not acceptable. People with disabilities and their carers must be put in the front line of those whose needs must be catered for. I will vote for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate will judge whether the Government has done enough for people with disabilities. Is the Minister satisfied with the long waiting lists for residential care and the lack of progress in the provision of access to buildings or public transport for people with disabilities? If the Government's record is so good, as the Minister stated, why must parents take High Court cases to secure an education for their children? Education for children with disabilities should be a right and not the gift of any Government. A forum should be established to hear submissions from parents of such children. Older children receive little or no service from the Department. A Department official should be appointed with responsibility for remedial action in each case. Such a forum should have equal representation of parents and Department officials. No one is better fitted to serve than the parents who dedicate all their lives to looking after their offspring with special needs.</P>
      <P>In August, the Government promised a Bill. I appeal to it to accept this Bill in a spirit of co-operation so that we can advance together the education and other needs of children with disabilities. According to the Constitution, we are supposed to cherish all our children equally. We have failed in that. At great sacrifice to themselves, great strides are being made by dedicated parents in providing education to their children. An autism special school was established in Galway with six pupils and has made outstanding progress. I encouraged the Government to make funds available to it and similar ones with an established track record in the education of children. I ask the Minister to support parents' efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Fitzgerald for introducing this Bill. Such a Bill should have been moved years ago. The disabled person's grant is not even available in Sligo. This Bill seeks to promote and protect the rights of people with disabilities, and to secure a fair, simple, speedy, efficient resolution to complaints of infringe<Col N="1470" /> ments of those rights. It provides for the appointment of a disability commissioner to prepare a code of disability rights and to investigate complaints against persons or bodies in breach of the code. This ought to be in place along with an assessment of needs of all persons with disability. It seeks to remove barriers to equality. Given the good economy, it is disappointing that in the dying days of the Government, the Minister is only now contemplating a Bill. The most vulnerable in our society are left to the last. As Deputy McCormack said, the electorate will judge the Government on its inaction.</P>

The challenge for us is to break free of the shackles of the Whips system to give effect to what we believe is the right thing to do.

      <P>We are familiar with the term that the poor must always wait but in the ethos of this Government, they must wait and the disabled must wait even longer. The regrettable reality is that we did not claim that this Bill is the panacea to all the ills confronting disabled people, but we believe that it is substantially different to the legislation to which Deputy Wallace referred. She stated that &ldquo;my goal since taking office has been to seek to place people with disabilities on an even footing with the rest of our citizens.&rdquo;  That was a good start but then she referred to various equality Bills. The real question is what benefit is this legislation to Jamie Sinnott and all the many thousands who cannot access services. This Bill is substantially different and more important because it breaks new ground by establishing a legal right, not to the Rolls Royce service which <Col N="1471" /> the Department of Finance, to which Deputies O'Donoghue and Martin kow-tow, fears will break the bank, but because it guarantees them a right to a service that puts them on an equal footing and grants mainstream status, as Deputy Wallace said in her speech.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin, the Minister for Health and Children, introduced an education Bill following the Sinnott judgment which made resources available contingent on Exchequer generosity. This Bill seeks to break new ground. Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in his mean spirited address referred to this Bill being inadequate but at the same time praised the Bill published by the National Parents and Siblings Alliance. Not only was his contribution mean spirited but it was out of touch because it is the same Bill. We are sponsoring the Bill given to us by the alliance. It is their publication last July which was good. Fine Gael are sponsoring it in the House.</P>

      <P>This is not the perfect Bill. The current position is that parents of children with a disability are prisoners of the system that ultimately might give them an assessment, but equally says at the end of that assessment that &ldquo;we actually have the service that you require also&rdquo;. As a result, children are inadequately placed.</P>
      <P>What we need is a legal right to an assessment of needs and individual plans for individual citizens that gives them a right to access a service commensurate with that assessment of needs. That is why this Bill is significantly different and breaks new ground. It will not break the bank. It is in keeping with the views expressed by the overwhelming majority of Members if one cuts through the adversarial nature of politics in the House. It is what everybody bar the three Ministers who spoke really wants to give effect to. It is what the public want to give effect to and it is regrettable that the parents and families of people with disability go through such difficulty on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the Sinnott judgment, this story had all the media attention but it was quickly dropped and went into a lull. We need constant attention on this issue. We will lose tonight's battle because of the party Whip system but we will not walk away from it until we win the war. The war is to establish a legal right to an assessment of needs and a legal right to access a service commensurate with those needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I first raised this issue with the Taoiseach last Thursday. It is fair to say that in</P>
      <P>recent months there has been a jobs meltdown in the northside, west and entire Dublin region. Today we heard the horrendous news of the possible loss of 3,200 jobs, which follows the loss of 2,000 at Gateway in August, 600 job losses at Intel and dozens of job losses in smaller companies. In mid-August I tried to contact the Taoiseach on the matter. In early September as leader of the Labour Party on the City Council I put forward a motion which was passed unanimously asking the Taoiseach, supposedly the premier north side representative, to establish a jobs task force the remit of which would be the replacement of jobs lost and the protection of existing jobs in the most vulnerable and deprived areas of the north and west sides of Dublin. The city manager, John Fitzgerald, contacted the Taoiseach in early September but over a month later he is still waiting for a reply.</P>
      <P>We need urgent action. Even before the events of 11 September there were a number of job losses on the north side as a result of a downturn in the IT sector and the general economic disaster of the Bush Presidency. Most on the north side were stunned on 9 August when we heard Gateway 2000 was closing. That closure was very carefully choreographed by the Tánaiste. The announcement was made at a time when the Tánaiste knew most of us were on holidays and when it was difficult for us to respond. This effectively meant the loss of 2,000 jobs as a year before that Gateway employed over 2,000 staff. Over a long period the number was allowed decrease and when the Tánaiste felt we were not looking it was closed. It is sad to see the factory for sale in the property pages of today's newspapers for £20 million. I wonder what the relationship is between the IDA and the Tánaiste in terms of that closure.</P>
      <P>The closure of Gateway 2000 is one of many. The Internet cabling company, 360 Com., a very interesting company which cabled the US and Europe with Ireland, providing the main Internet connection, also closed, as did Seronix, a brilliant electronics company which made heart pacemakers. There was also a setback in Intel where I understand there have been at least 600 redundancies. Motorola has also closed &ndash; I could go on and on. The north side industrial estates, such as Clonshaugh and Airways, the other airport industrial estates, the west side estates in Blanchardstown and north Kildare and the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot industrial estates have been devastated and we have had no action from the Government, though it is led by a Taoiseach from the north side and a Tánaiste from the west side. They have delivered absolutely nothing; they are just wringing their hands.</P>

    <P>This afternoon we had the sad spectacle of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, projecting the loss of 3,200 jobs, half the work force of our national airline, which will <Col N="1477" /> have a desperate impact not just on the north and west of Dublin but on the Limerick, Shannon, Cork and north Kerry regions. It is a disaster and the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are just wringing their hands while the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is like Loyola de Palacio laying down a right wing Thatcherite view of how we can behave in terms of our airline, a most amazing turn of events. We are the shareholder of that airline and the priority of the Minister should be to return the airline to profitability. It was doing very well through the sacrifices of the workforce and the work of the previous Government under my colleague, Deputy Spring, the former Tánaiste. That Government was prepared to invest money in the company and re-establish it as a very profitable business. We now have a pathetic response from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste who are not prepared to take the necessary action at EU level. We saw the immediate action taken by President Bush. He was prepared to invest resources, but here we have only had pussy-footing by the Minister with no action or effort to take a strong line at EU level.</P>
    <P>We have a jobs melt down on the north and west sides of Dublin and the Taoiseach, if he has bottle and a sense of responsibility, must do something as a matter of urgency for the area which he represents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I fully share his concern and disappointment over the recent job losses in north Dublin. I assure the Deputy and the House that every possible effort is being made by the national development agencies to secure replacement industries and by FÁS, the national training authority, to secure alternative employment for the work force affected.</P>
      <P>I am very encouraged by the level of job offers which have already been made to employees who recently lost their jobs. For example, in the case of the closure of the Gateway plant in Clonshaugh, the company was immediately contacted by approximately 160 employers interested in hiring its staff. Some 21 companies from north Dublin attended a jobs fair at Gateway to recruit staff for their own operations and interviews are ongoing. In the last three weeks, FÁS has established an on-site employment office at the Gateway plant to assist employees in finding alternative employment. The efforts of FÁS are ongoing in this regard and over 300 people have already secured alternative employment. FÁS expects that the majority of the remaining staff will be able to find employment in the near future. Over 250 staff indicated they wanted to take up FÁS evening classes in a range of skills and they have been accommodated in FÁS training centres in Finglas, Cabra and Baldoyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland remains in close contact with the company with a view to minimising the effects of the closure by encouraging the outsourcing of <Col N="1478" /> activities currently carried out by the company. I understand the company is involved in negotiations with a number of companies in this regard with the possibility of transferring both business and personnel.</P>
    <P>In the case of the staff of the Kylemore bakery who were recently made redundant, a significant number have already obtained alternative employment. FÁS and CERT, the State tourism training agency, have been working closely to provide a range of services for the employees and this work is ongoing. It is anticipated that the majority of the Kylemore staff will secure alternative employment very soon.</P>
    <P>In the case of the other smaller closures in north Dublin in recent times, the services of the State agencies have also been available. If we look at the overall greater Dublin area, job prospects are very encouraging. Total employment in the Dublin area has increased from 511,000 people in May 1999 to 547,000 people in May this year. In the same period the unemployment rate in the Dublin area fell from 4.7% to 2.9%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2000 employment in IDA companies increased from 33,000 to 52,000 people and in Enterprise Ireland sponsored companies from 44,000 to 51,000 people.</P>
      <P>The following major initiatives are currently creating significant job opportunities in the greater Dublin area. Construction on the new American Home Products facility at Grange Castle, near Clondalkin, is under way with 500 people already employed on site. This is the largest IDA project approved for Dublin in 2000. Construction will employ 2,500 over the next three years. The development represents a £1.1 billion investment by the company in Dublin and will create 1,300 jobs at full production. Recruitment of key personnel is already under way and significant recruitment will commence next year.</P>
      <P>Construction of the Bristol Myers Squib facility in Blanchardstown is well advanced and production is due to commence in early 2,003. Recruitment is under way at the moment with 430 new jobs to be created here. In addition, the company's £70 million investment in Swords has been completed and most of the 70 new jobs are already in place.</P>
      <P>The International Financial Services Centre, located in the Dublin Docklands, covers an area of 16 hectares and 120,000 square metres of world class offices have been developed for internationally traded services. A total of 800 projects have been licensed to trade there, including a number of leading banks and financial services companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin is now one of the world leaders in software development. Nearly all the major technology companies have now invested in Dublin. In order to position Ireland's digital media sector at the forefront of the emerging global media revolution, a digital media district is being set up in <Col N="1479" /> Dublin's inner city. The decision of the MIT media lab to locate in Dublin will greatly enhance the international profile of the industry in Dublin city and accelerate the development of this sector in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>North Park is a new £70 million business park being developed at the junction of the M50 and North Road in Finglas, Dublin 11. The new park will provide 600,000 square feet of industrial space and two office blocks in a landscaped environment. Other significant developments are also being undertaken at various business parks around the city and county. In addition, the county and city enterprise boards have been working with micro enterprises and small scale start ups to increase the stock of companies in the region. The county and city enterprise boards work in close co-operation with Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>The national development agencies are working effectively and successfully in securing industrial development in the Dublin region and the overall level of employment remains robust. We do not consider the establishment of another task force is justified in present circumstances, but we will be keeping developments in the north side under close and continuous review. The Deputy and the people of north Dublin can be fully assured that the Tánaiste and I, together with our Department and the State development agencies, with the full support of the Government, will leave no stone unturned in assisting the economic and industrial development of Dublin's north side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Spring. The news that Tralee Beef and Lamb closed yesterday at midday came as a major shock and disappointment to the work force and the farmers supplying the plant. There was no forewarning or notice given. The workers were informed after lunch yesterday that a receiver was moving in and that they had to leave. They left without their P45s and are still without them. More than 800 farmers supply Tralee Beef and Lamb. There was a throughput of about 800 to 1,000 cattle per week. Even last Monday, 130 cattle went through the plant. Farmers had no warning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 300 to 400 farmers are owed considerable sums of money, some since last July. Individual farmers are owed sums from £1,000 to £50,000. One cattle dealer is owed more than £140,000. A figure of £3 million is estimated to be owed to farmers. The receiver has an estimate of about £1.2 million, but the farming organisation is convinced that it will be even more than £3 million. These are not only from Kerry but from West Limerick and Cork as well. Many of them will go out of business if they do not receive payment very soon. Farmers will have to take their cattle <Col N="1480" /> to the Bandon or Rathkeale plants with an additional transport cost of £10 per animal.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the workers receive their P45s immediately so that they can draw their unemployment benefit and that the Government will step in in the event that there are insufficient financial resources to pay redundancy. There are 80 workers in the plant, many of them butchers and boners and they will find it quite difficult to get alternative employment. They have families to support as well as mortgages and car loans to repay. It has been a very hard blow for them.</P>
    <P>The farmers who are owed money should have first claim on the sale of assets otherwise many of them will go out of business. This comes as a major blow to the industrial base of Tralee and I appeal to the Government and the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that the workers and farmers are looked after and also to try to get another operator to come into the plant which is a state of the art facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Deenihan, for sharing his time. I shall not reiterate the points made by him except to say the loss of 80 jobs at any time in Tralee is a serious blow to the industrial economy of our town. The loss of a beef plant to the constituency and Kerry in general is a very serious blow as Deputy Deenihan has outlined.</P>
      <P>Given the confusion that exists and the lack of notice that was given, I probably know as much about the difficulty in this industry as anybody in this House, having lived through the Goodman saga a decade ago. This is a difficult business at any time. However, Tralee Beef and Lamb was a well-established business. The relationship was very good between the management, work force and farming community. We are now faced with quite a serious disaster.</P>
      <P>Given the confusion surrounding the reason for the company bringing in the receiver, we would like to see this business being re-established and either sold on or bought as a going concern. This is a modern Europe funded facility and there is a need for a beef and lamb production unit in Kerry. I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Minister of State to come to Tralee in the next few days to meet the management, work force and the farming community to see what the prospects are to have this business re-established as a going concern.</P>
      <P>There are two major concerns. One is that 80 jobs will be lost and the other relates to the sums of money lost to the farming community. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which has primary responsibility for the sector, should organise a meeting in Tralee in the next few days to meet the various interest groups. That would be of enormous help to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State or the senior Minister, Deputy Walsh, to come to Tralee to meet <Col N="1481" /> the concerned parties. In this day and age what has happened to Tralee Beef and Lamb is not acceptable. It is a difficult industry but with goodwill all round and support from the banks, this factory could be re-opened as a going concern without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an mbeirt Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a ardú. I thank the Deputies for raising this question. It was with regret that I heard first on Raidió na Gaeltachta of the closure of this factory. I share the Deputies' concerns over the loss of employment and the effect on the farming community.</P>
      <P>Tralee Beef and Lamb is a privately owned company, which employs some 70 staff in the processing of cattle and sheep for the domestic and export markets. The company went into receivership yesterday. This has resulted in a considerable number of creditors, including its farmer suppliers of cattle being owed significant sums of money. My information is that payment for cattle had not been made for deliveries in the past four to five weeks. This company slaughtered an average 800 cattle per week and occasional deliveries of sheep.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the closure and receivership of this company is regrettable, both in terms of the immediate loss of employment and because of the impact on cattle suppliers and other creditors who are left in very uncertain circumstances as regards the moneys owed to them. Farmer suppliers feature strongly among this group. I understand that in some instances farmers are owed figures of the order of £20,000. However, this is a commercial issue, which will have to be resolved between the creditors and the receiver, and I urge farmers to contact the receiver immediately to pursue their claims.</P>
      <P>In most other cases in the beef-processing sector, same day payment for cattle deliveries has been the norm for some considerable time. The main competitors of Tralee Beef and Lamb pay for cattle under conditions, which are far more favourable than was the case with this company.</P>
      <P>This enterprise, which was a custom built facility received national and EU grant aid totalling more than £200,000 in 1996 when it commenced production. It is a major disappointment that this company has now ceased trading in the circumstances reported today.</P>
      <P>I will certainly convey the sentiments expressed by both Deputies to my senior colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease had fairly catastrophic consequences for the area. With the passage of time the impact of it has not decreased. <Col N="1482" /> There remains a residue of unhappiness in the area in the wake of the cull, particularly relating to the level of compensation that has been paid. There are indications that a review procedure will be put in place and I would like to hear tonight the time scale for the establishment of the review tribunal.</P>
      <P>The sheep cull removed from the area the principal source of income for many farmers in an area where there is a significant number of part-time and full-time farmers. The impact on the sheep population in Britain particularly has left a shortage of supply of breeding stock with a consequent increase in demand and price. This has left the farmers at a disadvantage on the double. The review of the compensation level is still awaited and I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me the position on this.</P>
      <P>There is some doubt about the ewe quota that needs clarification. Will farmers, for instance, be allowed to retain that ewe quota until they have the full complement of stock back on their lands? Because of the considerable numbers required, it will take some time to restock fully. I am pleased also that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, is here tonight. He recently announced the rural regeneration programme, CLÁR, for the Cooley Peninsula. I am aware he will visit the peninsula tomorrow evening and his visit is awaited with considerable interest. People are anxious to know what exactly is involved with the CLÁR programme and perhaps he might take the opportunity tonight to give us a preview of what is contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo agus ar an dul chun cinn atá a dhéanamh le rudaí a fheabhsú sa cheantar seo i gCondae Lú, a bhí buailte go dona leis an ngalar crúb agus béal. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; at Proleek on the Cooley Peninsula had severe implications for the population of the area, in particular for livestock owners. It necessitated measures to contain and deal with the outbreak, which involved depopulation of susceptible species throughout the area. The impact of this experience on the farmers of Cooley has been acknowledged on previous occasions in the House and elsewhere. I am pleased that a phased re-stocking has been under way for some time, with cattle and sheep returning to farms in the area. Some of these sheep were purchased in my part of the world, and we welcome our neighbours from across the country at any time, particularly when they are buying. This is welcome and hugely important in enabling the people of Cooley to put the FMD experience behind them and move on. If farming is once again to thrive on the peninsula, it is important that farmers look to and begin to plan for the future. It is, moreover, important for the image of and sentiment towards the area, in farming and every other respect, that it moves forward and is seen to put the FMD experience behind it. This is not to diminish or trivialise the experience <Col N="1483" /> which the people of Cooley have endured but rather to encourage them to look to what can be once again a bright future for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>There are items of what the farmers of Cooley regard as unfinished business arising from the FMD outbreak and its consequences. These issues have been the subject of various exchanges and of discussion between a top level delegation from the IFA, which included a number of Cooley farmers and the Secretary General and other senior officials of my Department, as recently as 21 September this year. At that meeting it was agreed that a number of propositions put by the IFA and a number of concerns expressed would be considered by the Department. That is being done and responses to the various points raised will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>I listened with particular interest to what the Deputy said on ewe quota. I fully realise that re-stocking a hill is not as simple a matter as many people think because stock not born on a hill will tend to wander back to the place from where they came. I will certainly raise the ewe quota issue in the Department and come back to the Deputy with a specific response on it.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government gave a commitment for a targeted investment programme in both urban and rural disadvantaged areas. CLÁR is the programme for revitalising rural areas. I launched this programme in Strokestown last week.</P>
      <P>I have selected 16 areas &ndash; including Cooley &ndash; to participate in the programme and I emphasise that these areas have not been selected randomly or arbitrarily. The main criteria for selecting them was a percentage loss of population between 1926 and 1996. These are, in general, the areas experiencing the most rural degeneration with a constant decline in population, withdrawal of services and all the attendant problems that brings, but, as I have said, I have also included the area which had a full cull of livestock due to foot and mouth disease, that is, the Cooley Peninsula. To do otherwise would have been to ignore the area that has suffered the greatest devastation this year due to that cull. The average loss of population in the rest of the areas is 50% and the total population of the areas that will benefit from this programme is 283,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims of CLÁR are to reduce social exclusion in the 16 areas. We will do this through the development of physical, social and community infrastructure. CLÁR will accelerate investments under the national development plan in order to tackle the decline in the regions identified and to overcome the new problems in the Cooley area. In addition, as recently announced by the Taoiseach, there will be a direct fund of £20 million over a two year period up to 2003 to underpin the success of the programme. CLÁR will complement the RAPID programme announced by the Government earlier this year for disadvantaged urban areas and also the pro<Col N="1484" /> gramme for provincial towns to be announced soon by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>These three measures clearly illustrate the Government's commitment to tackling social exclusion. I intend that this programme will operate using existing structures, working closely with State agencies, and complement the range of initiatives and programmes already in place.</P>
    <P>Since this programme focuses on priority of investment under the national development plan, the action identified will mirror closely the various investment programmes in the NDP and will also have regard to existing plans for the regions. In other words, we will use CDP's and all the other agencies that have existing plans, including regional assemblies, local authorities, Leader groups etc., so that we can get this programme operating on the ground immediately.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to consult with local interests, as the Deputy mentioned, I will visit the Cooley area tomorrow where I will meet the public and the various interests to discuss what they believe are the priorities in their area. Following these meetings we will draw up an action plan for each area which will then be agreed with other relevant Departments. My aim is to complete this phase of the programme by the end of this year and that investments to these areas can begin to flow early in 2002. Prioritisation under the programme will be the key to this, particularly bringing forward as quickly as possible those measures that can be done in 2002 and planning those that can be done in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006.</P>
    <P>Among all the various parties involved, I am sure the priorities identified by the communities in the areas selected can be accommodated thus leading to an alleviation of population decline, disadvantage and the sense of loss of community that has been felt by these communities for so long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Government announce the decentralisation programme for south Tipperary, or has it any intention of announcing such a decentralisation programme? We have waited too long for this announcement and various promises have been made. In the 2000 by-election we were told a decision would be made by September 2000. Later in September, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Davern, went on local radio, Tipp FM, and said that the decentralisation programme would be announced before Christmas 2000. In the 2001 by-election, the Fianna Fáil director of elections, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that the programme would be announced by September of this year. Nothing happened following those announcements and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, was reported in the media in early September this year as saying that an announcement would be made within a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will this announcement be made? We have had enough promises and we need action <Col N="1485" /> now. South Tipperary has an unanswerable case for decentralisation. It is the only county in Munster without a decentralised Department and there is not a single decentralised job in the county. On the basis of the previous two rounds of decentralisation and the proposed decentralisation, the county would be entitled to approximately 750 decentralised jobs.</P>
    <P>South Tipperary cannot wait any longer for decentralisation, in particular the towns of Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town. Those towns have inordinate levels of unemployment, running at something like 12%, which is three times the national average. The lifeblood of those towns, young people, are leaving and are not returning. A total of 94% of young people leave both Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town either for education or employment, and do not return. Recent studies on deprivation show that approximately 50% of the population of south Tipperary live in designated deprived areas.</P>
    <P>This is especially the case in the two district electoral divisions, in Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town. They are classed in the lowest grades four and five in that survey.</P>
    <P>The county has been in the lower part of the county prosperity league. Up to 2000 it was placed seventh lowest in the league but in 2001 it dropped to fifth from the bottom. On that basis decentralisation is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The electricity infrastructure in the county is totally inadequate. The norm is a facility of 220kv but nowhere in the county is it available. Only Clonmel has a 120kv facility.</P>
    <P>The county is in the south-east region, the lowest by way of development, even though other regions such as the BMW region, are allocated substantial investment and grants and EU development aid. The south-east is considerably worse off.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a specific undertaking with a specific time scale that the long promised decentralisation for south Tipperary will be announced in the House tonight. Numerous promises have been made and all the deadlines have passed. Since the Government took office over four years ago local and national politicians in the Fianna Fáil Party have whispered throughout south Tipperary that decentralisation was on the way. The Minister should announce such a programme tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of decentralisation is one which, I know well, is close to the hearts of many Members of this House and the fact that it should be raised so soon after the summer recess amply demonstrates that. As an advocate of decentralisation and one who has seen, at first hand, the benefits which it can bring to a local community and to those who have decentralised, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to once again address the issue here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of city centre congestion in Dublin is one which is acutely familiar to all of us who, for <Col N="1486" /> reasons of work or pleasure, have to come into the city. The Government is committed to tackling the problem of congestion and is pursuing, on a number of fronts, various initiatives which will, in time, significantly improve the existing situation. I am convinced that decentralisation is one area where the Government can take a lead.</P>
    <P>While the relocation of several thousand civil and public servants may not, in itself, have a dramatic effect on city centre congestion, it will demonstrate to other sectors of the economy how it is possible, indeed desirable, to conduct important business outside the capital. The Government has a responsibility to play its part and through the vehicle of decentralisation can play it very effectively.</P>
    <P>In the context of a major programme of decentralisation, the issue of staff welfare is very much to the forefront of everybody's mind. The Minister has, in this regard, been very consistent in restating his commitment to the voluntary nature of decentralisation. It is a legitimate aspiration for anybody who wishes to do so to own their own home and I am only too well aware of the struggle being experienced by the many who feel that home ownership is beyond them in and around Dublin. Many public servants, and indeed thousands of Dublin based workers, are now involved in lengthy and very time consuming commutes to and from their homes. There is an increasing quality of life issue associated with travelling to work in the city and the prospect of being able to live in much greater proximity to the workplace should be a big factor in ensuring the success of a new programme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the issue of decentralisation is one that has featured most regularly in parliamentary questions and in a number of Adjournment debates over the past year or so. There has also been considerable interest in both the national and local media. I am pleased to say that considerable progress has been made in developing proposals for a new programme, notwithstanding the volume of material received in the Department of Finance from various local authorities, chambers of commerce, community associations and so on. Much of this material has been of a very high quality and the arguments advancing the merits of so many centres throughout the country have been well made.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation, chaired by the Minister for Finance, has been considering the various aspects associated with a new and comprehensive programme and that work is continuing. There are important lessons to be learned from the previous experience of decentralisation and there is a clear determination that those lessons must not only be learned but applied. This Government will not be rushed into a premature decision on a new programme and considers it critical that any such decision be taken only having first considered all of the relevant issues, including the very many excellent submissions made.</P>

      <P>Many of my colleagues in this House have seen at first hand the benefits that decentralisation has made to so many local communities throughout the country. It is this kind of experience which makes me such an enthusiastic advocate of decentralisation. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, and Deputy Healy strongly support the case for the inclusion of south Tipperary in a new programme and the Deputy should be assured that the case has been well made and is one which will be fully considered in advance of a Government decision.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Healy for again raising such a topical issue, one which I know is of so much interest both inside and outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The textile sector has been under severe pressure for a number of years. Jobs within the sector have reduced despite positive growth elsewhere. Competitiveness and the availability of skilled labour are the major obstacles.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has more than 160 client companies working in the clothing and textile sector. However, the industry needs to make some changes in regard to the type of product being offered. To remain competitive the industry needs a higher value added product to sell into niche markets for higher margins. Enterprise Ireland is already promoting this concept to all its client companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> All Enterprise Ireland supports are available to companies within the clothing and textiles sector. Specific supports are dependent on client needs and are becoming more focused on capability building within companies that is training and management development. Enterprise Ireland also offers a range of market development supports as well as financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Assistance is designed to be as flexible and responsive as possible. This can range from finding a designer to work with a company to marketing support to ensure companies are targeting their products for the market. Overall, supports are available in strategy management, production and operations, design, marketing and finance.</P>
    <P>We are already seeing some examples of the success of this strategy in the regions. County Donegal is one case in point where the majority of Enterprise Ireland companies have found a balance between producing high quality niche products in small volumes in Ireland and outsourcing their large volume orders from lower cost countries. This balance is necessary for any manufacturing company to survive in the competitive market place today.</P>
    <P>The textile sector is very much in an era of change but I am satisfied the actions we have taken and will continue to take will address the problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of older people in the workforce will grow in coming years with the population under 25 set to fall while the numbers in the older age groups are forecast to rise. Given these trends I believe that it is prudent to look at ways of encouraging older people, embracing retired persons and women in the home, who wish to do so, to return to the workforce, as well as assisting older unemployed in their transition to employment.</P>
      <P>Government policy aimed at reducing the overall tax burden on labour, the reform of the tax system, and the individualisation of the standard rate tax band, all serve to increase the incentive to persons returning to work. This policy will act as an incentive for older people to continue working, for women returners and older unemployed to seek and take up a job and for retired persons to return to the workforce, especially those who may wish to work part time to supplement their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of further initiatives in this area, I am considering a number of matters in the context of both short-term and long-term agendas for <Col N="1492" /> action. The type of areas under current consideration are those which focus on initiatives that promote opportunities, match people with vacancies and address the twin issues of training and retraining. FÁS has a role to play here and I will ask it to examine the further steps that can be taken to afford older persons appropriate opportunities to take up suitable vacancies, and in exploring possibilities to hold discussions with employer organisations about those issues. Longer-term issues in the area of pensions, taxation and benefits, and their interaction and impact on the decisions of older workers, will also be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983.</P>
      <P>Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income until 31 December 1991. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy, which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc. Approximately £18 million remains in the fund.</P>
      <P>The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration.</P>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund also received an advance of £100 million in 1985 from the Exchequer for the administration of Icarom plc following the failure of ICI. The advance involved funding arrangements from the banking sector.</P>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund is under the control of the High Court. It may be drawn down only in the event of a liquidation of an Irish authorised non-life insurance company. Under current legislation, therefore, the fund cannot be used in the case of Independent Insurance.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the collapse of Independent Insurance Company Limited.</P>
      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited is a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, the UK authorities are responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>The position is that the company is in liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. The company is under investigation by the serious fraud office in the UK.</P>
      <P>Officials of our Department have met officials in the UK treasury department and the Financial Services Authority. They stressed our concerns in relation to Irish policyholders with Independent Insurance Company Limited. The UK authorities have undertaken to examine the application of the existing law governing the UK policyholders protection fund, to Irish policyholders.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the difficulties being faced by policyholders and am very concerned that any company would face closure because of the failure of Independent Insurance Company, it would not be acceptable to burden taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO live register monthly area analysis shows that numbers claiming unemployment benefits in the north west region, comprising counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, have fallen from 17,822 in March 1997 to 13,935 at the end of August 2001. This represents a drop of 22%.</P>
      <P>However, live register figures include those working part-time. The Quarterly National Household Survey shows that numbers fully unemployed in the Border region, which includes the three relevant counties, declined from 14,700, or 8.9% of the labour force, in November 1998 to 9,900, or 5.5% of the labour force, in May 2001. During this period, those in employment in the Border region increased by 13%, from 150,000 to 170,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data from the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, Údarás na Gaeltachta, and the County Enterprise Boards &ndash; show that, in the period 1997-2000, jobs created exceeded job losses by around 700 in the three north west counties. Furthermore, IDA is seeking in 2001 to maintain its target, achieved in 2000, of delivering 50% of new internationally mobile jobs to the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region. Enterprise Ireland, in addition to fostering exist<Col N="1495" /> ing clients with high growth potential and providing incubation and start-up space, is identifying new opportunities involving expansion-minded Dublin-based companies. In the past two years, six such companies have expanded into the north west region.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced a number of significant new projects for the region, including Prumerica Systems, Pacificare, Interventional Technologies and Kirchhoff Ireland in Letterkenny, Forward Emphasis in Malin, Iontas in Moville, MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon, Abbott Ireland in Sligo, and in the past few days projects by Mulmuf Limited and a major investment by Transware, both also in Sligo. These and other projects recently announced for the region have the potential to create almost 2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>My Department and its agencies are taking a number of actions to ensure the continuing attractiveness of the north west region, including the completion of the infrastructural elements of the national development plan &ndash; this will take on board the recommendations of the upcoming national spatial strategy &ndash; the implementation by both IDA and Enterprise Ireland of their enhanced regional strategies; the deepening of the country's skills base, with particular emphasis on the initiatives of the newly established Science Foundation Ireland; and exploiting, through co-operation with Intertrade Ireland, the opportunities for enterprise which are opening up as a result of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will however appreciate the potential impact of the serious and unforeseen factors which have emerged recently, namely foot and mouth disease, the escalating downturn in the information and communications technology industry world-wide, and the tragic events in the US. Inevitably the combination of these factors will act to substantially moderate our recent exceptional performance. I am, however, confident that the country can weather this difficult time effectively given the continuing strong fundamentals of our economy. </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 122, 135, 151, 159 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, was a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities who were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>Officials of our Department have met officials from the UK treasury department and from the Financial Services Authority in the UK. They stressed our concerns in relation to Irish policyholders with Independent Insurance Company Limited.</P>
      <P>The position is that the company is in liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. The company is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK.</P>
      <P>The UK does not operate a &ldquo;no failures policy&rdquo; in relation to financial institutions. The UK has, however, a safety net in the form of the policyholders protection fund to compensate policyholders of failed insurance undertakings, who meet certain criteria. In this connection, they have undertaken to examine the application of the existing law governing the fund, to Irish policyholders.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the difficulties being faced by policyholders and am very concerned that any company would face closure because of the failure of Independent Insurance Company, it would not be acceptable to burden taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK Company.</P>

      <P>Since the closure of the company on 4 July 2001, all of the 65 staff have been offered the services of FÁS. Many have not yet availed of the service. However, those who have registered are receiving the help of an employment services officer. Their training or retraining needs are being identified where appropriate and they are being given easy and quick access to employers who have suitable vacancies advertised with FÁS. A number of ex-employees have been offered training and are being given priority on existing programmes.</P>
      <P>On 12 September I announced that Enterprise Ireland and FÁS are to jointly fund the hiring of an executive by the Athy Investment Development and Employment Forum for one year, to help to develop a series of responses to the socio-economic issues being faced by the town. Both agencies have key roles and a deep interest in regional development and work to foster community-led initiatives in the area. I am hopeful that this support, linked with the considerable local input already made by a number of agencies, including Kildare County Enterprise Board, Kildare County Council and Athy Urban District Council will make a substantial positive difference to the employment situation in Athy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the Fourth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to <Col N="1499" /> be held in Doha, Qatar from 9 to 13 November 2001, will take the necessary decisions to launch a new round of trade negotiations in the WTO. The failure of the Seattle ministerial meeting in December 1999 to launch a new round of negotiations was a great disappointment.</P>
    <P>The launching of a new round would be a very positive signal in the context of the current global economic downturn, particularly in the aftermath of the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been, and is, engaged in the detailed work, within the WTO, preparing for these negotiations. Ireland has participated fully in the preparation of EU positions and subscribes fully to the European Council conclusions of October 1999, which form the mandate for European Community negotiators.</P>
    <P>The EU is firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The position of developing countries is central to the whole preparatory process and Ireland has ensured that the legitimate concerns of developing countries are taken into consideration. Implementation issues and special and differential treatment across a broad range of negotiations are key concerns for developing countries.</P>
    <P>Eight rounds of trade liberalisation and strengthening of multilateral trade rules have made a major contribution to global prosperity, development and rising living standards. Since 1951, global trade has grown seventeen-fold, world production has more than quadrupled, and world <i>per capita </i>income has doubled. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50% over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. In recent years, the volume of global trade has increased substantially. WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 128 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The following investigations are ongoing: five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. The examinations of Celtic Helicopters Limited and Kentford Securities Limited are well advanced, and I expect to receive reports on these companies before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In July 2000 the High Court quashed my decision to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. An appeal was lodged on my behalf with the Supreme Court. This was heard on 2 July 2001 and the Supreme Court reserved judgment. The court's decision is awaited.</P>
      <P>Three High Court inquiries are being undertaken into National Irish Bank Limited (NIB) and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. These inquiries are expected to conclude towards the end of this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>Reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.</P>
      <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to about £5.96 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil service staff who are working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations are being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the amount of £5.96 million, the cost of the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, which are being undertaken by High Court <Col N="1501" /> inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, currently stands at about £3.3 million. None of this has yet been recovered from the two companies. As I have indicated previously, I intend to request the High Court to order the full recoupment from the companies concerned of these costs on completion of the inquiries.</P>
    <P>Of the balance of £2.66 million, the principal areas of expenditure have been incurred on the investigations of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited &ndash; £1.9 million, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc &ndash; £204,000, Faxhill Homes Limited &ndash; £207,000, IIB Bank Limited &ndash; £128,000 and various other section 19 investigations &ndash; £55,000. The sum also includes £170,000 in respect of the State's portion of the costs of liquidating the group of companies associated with the Clonmannon Retirement Village.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 123, 136, 137, 143 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &ndash; known as the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by, and obtainable directly from, the authority.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 19 construction-related fatalities in 2000, while 15 construction related fatal accidents have been reported to date in 2001. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the authority, for 2000, is 734. Comparative data for 2001 is not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code which is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. In this regard, the additional financial and staffing resources which I have secured for the authority, are being put to particular effect in the construction sector <Col N="1503" /> through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities.</P>
    <P>However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in that sector, a continuance of a partnership approach to safety, as embodied by the Construction Safety Partnership, CSP, is crucial. The CSP is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and other relevant Departments or agencies.</P>
    <P>In November 2000, the CSP produced a detailed three-year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan includes measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas including the initiation of a safety representatives pilot project. This project has resulted, so far, in the provision of training for 160 safety representatives and is a highly commendable joint ICTU/CIF project. Other areas of progress include the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, increased inspection by the Health and Safety Authority, the establishment of a Joint ICTU/CIF Safety Council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities and, most recently, the development of amendments to the existing 1995 construction regulations.</P>
    <P>These legislative amendments will take effect from 1 January next year and I hope to sign the amended regulations shortly. They are extremely significant in that they will introduce, for the first time, the concepts of mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representation, while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. Further amendments to the 1995 construction regulations are also being explored under the auspices of the CSP.</P>
    <P>In addition, in response to my request, the board of the Health and Safety Authority has completed the review of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and legislative proposals to amend the Act are presently being developed at departmental level. It is my intention to address a number of pertinent issues in this context, such as the issues of offences and penalties, with a view to strengthening those provisions. A strengthened and updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will of course be of benefit to all sectors of employment.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the revised construction regulations, the State continues to play its role in the effort to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector, through the provision of a strong legislative base and the provision of the associated training, advisory, inspection and enforcement services. I am confident that both sides of industry will also respond in a <Col N="1504" /> positive manner and take on board their particular responsibilities and duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 129 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain essential services currently provided by participants on community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; are being mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for these services.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of schools services is currently under way and after an appropriate transition period to allow participants work out their contracts in schools, such services will be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. Arising from these changes, an additional £46 million is to be made directly available to schools on an annual basis, phased in by 2003, for the purposes of providing replacement services in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the completion of the transfer of CE funding to the Department of Education and Science, there will be no further CE involvement in schools services. CE participants currently working in schools will be facilitated in completing their full engagement in their school project, which may be for a period up to three years. The new flexibility arrangements for certain disadvantaged workers on CE, which I recently announced, will not apply in schools projects. <Col N="1505" /> However, such participants may be facilitated in non-school projects.</P>
    <P>Supervisors are employed by sponsors of CE projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. Under the mainstreaming of schools services supervisors may be retained to manage dedicated schools projects for so long as at least five participants remain on the project. They will then remain for a further period of up to two months from the date of departure of the fifth participant to facilitate the orderly winding down of the project. The positions held by supervisors in these schools projects will then be made redundant as the mainstreaming of schools services is phased in and as these projects are discontinued.</P>
    <P>FÁS employment services will make every effort to ensure that CE supervisors being made redundant are made aware of other employment opportunities, including those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other CE schemes. FÁS employment services will initiate contact with such supervisors and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of CE supervisors for future prospective employers.</P>

      <P>It will not be possible to determine, with precision, the final net cost before end 2002 because the reimbursement of German VAT &ndash; which may amount to over £0.65 million &ndash;  is not likely to be completed before then.</P>
      <P>In any event, I can assure the Deputy that the total cost of Ireland's participation in EXPO 2000 will not exceed the approved amount of £9.1 million.</P>

      <P>My Department had been in regular contact with the management of Irish ISPAT in regard to the company's obligations under the 1996 Sale Agreement. I was also aware of the strong competitive difficulties internationally for producers of steel. However, I was dismayed to learn from the management of the company on 15 June 2001 that it was going to shut down its steel manufacturing plant at Haulbowline, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I travelled to London on 22 June 2001 and met with senior management of ISPAT International who stated that they considered their Irish subsidiary was not capable of achieving viability. Following that, Irish ISPAT went into liquidation on 28 June 2001.</P>
      <P>I want to inform Deputies of my appreciation of the efforts of the Labour Relations Commission to assist the management of Irish ISPAT and the trade unions to work out a viability plan, which unfortunately did not result in the continuation of operations at the plant.</P>
      <P>With regard to the retraining of the ISPAT employees, I understand that FÁS has met the employees to establish their training needs. About 218 of the employees have registered for either job vacancies or training or re-skilling etc. and FÁS is currently preparing programmes around their needs. A number of the craftspeople and a number of those with computer skills have found alternative employment. Also, approximately 18 apprentices have been placed in new jobs.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a high level of satisfaction among the former ISPAT employees and their trade unions with the response by FÁS to the situation. A FÁS co-ordinating committee is in place and a representative of the ISPAT trade unions has been nominated to this committee.</P>
      <P>FÁS will continue to offer its services to those employees wishing to avail of them.</P>

      <P>It is essential that FÁS play a strong role in underpinning recent rapid economic and employment gains. In this regard an important focus will be on continuous upskilling of those both in and seeking employment so as to ensure an adaptable workforce capable of meeting the challenges ahead and in order to maintain and enhance the competitiveness of firms. We are also presented with an opportunity to place a continuing focus on assisting the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in their transition to employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to question why insurance premiums should be increasing in an environment where, for example, the numbers of motorists are increasing at the same time that accident rates are declining. Equally, while the numbers at work have increased, the effort to improve workplace safety seems to be resulting in fewer accidents. This is not to be complacent. Clearly, we must continue to strive to reduce accidents.</P>
      <P>However, it must be acknowledged that the environment for insurance costs has deteriorated in recent months. I understand that re-insurance costs were already escalating before the tragic events of 11 September in New York. In addition, recent High Court judgments will require insurers to strengthen reserves for past claims not yet settled as well as future claims.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU law, I am not in a position to intervene in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. Apart from continuing to encourage active competition on the Irish market, I am confident that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, by reducing the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, will assist in moderating insurance costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 2000, I introduced a &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; process entitled the working visa/work authorisation scheme for the <Col N="1509" /> employment of non-EEA nationals. This scheme applies to registered nurses as well as employees in the information and computing technologies sector and construction professionals. This scheme makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and Consulates abroad. Working visas and work authorisations are issued to the employee to come to this country to work for a period of up to two years. Provided that everything is in order, the processing time for dealing with the applications averages about six working days.</P>
      <P>The processing time for work permit applications has risen this year due to the unprecedented number of applications that continue to be received in the Department. The number of applications has increased from an average of 350 applications per week last year to over 1,000 per week recently. Increases in staff resources and overtime have facilitated the issue of over 26,800 work permits in the first eight months of this year compared to 18,000 for the full year in 2000.</P>
      <P>The current processing time for the issue of work permits is approximately eight weeks assuming that the application is correct and complete. The Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of work permits.</P>
      <P>Consideration is also being given to expanding the categories of healthcare personnel to which the working visa/work authorisation facility can be extended.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with the introduction by this Government of a national minimum wage in 2000, the Government authorised an increase in the Labour Inspectorate to 17 inspectors which equated to almost a 100% increase in personnel. As pointed out in a recent report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers that number has fluctuated in the interim. I am pleased to report that, as of this week, the Inspectorate is again at full strength.</P>
      <P>The consultants' report to which I refer was completed following an intensive business process re-engineering project across the entire employment rights enforcement section of my Department. The consultants found that it was difficult to determine an appropriate yardstick to define what the appropriate number of inspectors should be. They linked the size of the Inspectorate to the Department's level of ambition in relation to conducting targeted investigations and following up on complaints received.</P>
      <P>The level of ambition of the work of the Inspectorate will be pursued in the context of the Inspectorate's business plan for 2002. The issue of staffing resources will be addressed in this connection.</P>
      <P>Since January 2001, 18 cases have been brought forward for prosecution. Of these, one case was struck out, another could not proceed as the company was dissolved and four cases were settled prior to hearing. The remaining 12 cases resulted in convictions and fines, including in most instances the awarding of expenses and costs. The breaches detected came under the Industrial Relations Acts, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Protection of Young Persons Act and the Payment of Wages Act. In certain cases there were multiple breaches involving several pieces of legislation.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for work permits received by my Department in the 12 months to 30 September 2001 was 38,037 applications. This includes new applications and applications for renewal of work permits.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 2001 when a pre-check vetting system was introduced by the work permits section only correct and complete applications were accepted. This means that incomplete applications or those applications that are not accompanied by the correct fee including the necessary photographs and documentation are returned and are not regarded as valid applications for statistical purposes.</P>
      <P>The number of work permit applications processed during the 12 months in question was 35,985 and includes the number of applications issued, refused and withdrawn. The number of work permits issued in this period was 34,150, the number refused was 707 and the number withdrawn was 1,128.</P>
      <P>The number of work permits issued in respect of the various sectors of industry in the past 36 months are as follows:</P>

    <P>The number of work permit applications issued by my Department increased by 300% last year and by a further 200% this year. Increases in staff resources and overtime have facilitated the issue of more than 26,800 work permits in the first nine months of this year compared to 18,000 for the full year in 2000. It is currently taking more than 40 working days to process applications.</P>
    <P>Approval was received late last year for a 50% increase in staffing in the work permits section. The appointment of these additional staff has facilitated the processing of increased work permit numbers this year. A further request to increase staffing levels has recently been made and I understand this request is currently being considered by the Department of Finance. Some staff from within the Department have been reassigned to the work permits section also.</P>
    <P>Policy for the issuing of work permits is being kept under close scrutiny in the light of recent negative world wide economic developments.</P>

      <P>In response to a changing dynamic in the Irish economy, IDA Ireland has recently decided to implement a new strategy for the agency going forward until 2010. This new strategy has a three pronged approach to continue to attract quality foreign direct investment from existing and new companies with a focus on developing clusters of world class industries and moving from cost based to knowledge based investments; the establishment of regional economic centres at key locations which have not seen the full benefit of growth in recent years, while maintaining the target of doubling the number of jobs from greenfield projects in the Objective One regions; and a greater focus by the agency on the areas of education, skills and research to ensure key future competitive advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Against this background, IDA Ireland will continue its efforts for the delivery of new, higher value and replacement jobs. The agency is already working with existing companies to assist them in upgrading their activities. The agency will also be looking at niches where there is potential for Ireland to become the number one player and shifting the focus from an individual project focus to a cluster dynamic.</P>
    <P>Recently, the IDA announced that additional posts would be transferred to Athlone, which will comprise staff from regions, property, and healthcare divisions bringing the staff compliment up to 30. In addition, posts are being transferred to Sligo comprising staff from international services and consumer products divisions bringing the staff compliment up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions, and to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
    <P>Also, in an effort to achieve a better regional distribution of jobs, the IDA has acquired a number of additional sites and upgraded many of its sites to business park standard. Furthermore, it has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations.</P>

      <P>While I have no statutory responsibility in relation to the matter, I share the concern of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science on this issue. If Ireland is to grow its competitiveness in technology, it is desirable that we have a strong interest and participation in science subjects in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the following steps are being taken by the Minister for Education and Science to address the matter. A task force on the uptake <Col N="1515" /> of the physical sciences at both second and third level has been established. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues that contribute to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. A new biology syllabus will be introduced in September 2002 for first examination in June 2004. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised. A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year. Additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided to schools. Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. A special annual <i>per capita </i>grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry has been introduced.</P>

      <P>The employment performance of the Irish economy was exceptionally buoyant in 2000. Firms supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland created over 33,000 permanent full-time jobs, with a net increase in employment of almost 22,000. In addition, firms supported by the county enterprise boards created a further 3,355 jobs.</P>
      <P>Up to recently, both agencies remained optimistic about this year's performance, forecasting 21,000 new jobs and a net employment increase of 11,000. However, we are all aware of the unforeseen factors which have arisen, namely foot and mouth, the escalation of difficulties in the IT industry and most recently the tragic events in the US. These factors have combined to significantly moderate the agencies' expectations for the current year. While Forfás expects overall job creation to remain strong at about 19,500, the net employment increase has been revised significantly downwards to 3,400, the bulk of this adjustment being due to increased job losses in foreign owned firms particularly those based in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While any deterioration in these figures is disappointing, the fundamentals of our economy <Col N="1516" /> remain strong. I am confident that we can withstand the present downturn and remain an attractive location for both foreign direct investment and indigenous firms. To this end, the Government is continuing to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment, and encouraging companies to move up the value chain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective way of ensuring that the euro does not lead to an increase in prices is to empower consumers to monitor prices. To do this, consumers need to be able to compare prices between Irish pounds and euros through exposure to dual pricing. That is the objective of the national code of practice on dual display of prices, which was drawn up in conjunction with the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the commencement date on 1 October last, large numbers of organisations had already signed up to the national code or to sectoral codes which have been approved under it by the <Col N="1517" /> Director of Consumer Affairs. This shows that businesses generally are anxious to carry out the changeover fairly and to be seen to do so &ndash; they want to retain their customers' confidence now, throughout the changeover, and long after it is over. It is vital that consumers realise the power that they have in this area: the ultimate sanction for any trader who seeks to take advantage of the changeover is loss of business.</P>
    <P>Should it happen that consumers think they are not being treated fairly, and do not get satisfaction when they make a complaint, they will be entitled to take the matter up with the Director of Consumer Affairs. The director will publicly name and shame any trader who displays the logo associated with adherence to the national code or to the approved sectoral codes, but fails to live up to the commitments involved. A concrete example of the power of negative publicity was provided last month when, as a result of a consumer outcry and concerns expressed by myself and the director, a certain company cancelled its plans to replace its one-pint carton of milk with a half-litre carton. I had been in direct contact with the company following its original announcement, and I subsequently welcomed the company's decision to honour its commitments in relation to the euro.</P>
    <P>Speaking for both the Director of Consumer Affairs and for myself, our priority is to ensure that the action taken on dual display of prices, as well as the informational activities under way and envisaged by the director, will maximise the likelihood that the changeover to the euro will prove a positive experience overall for the country and its citizens.</P>

      <P>I would like to place my reply to this question within the overall context in which the Government decided in favour of Ireland's participation in EXPO 2000.</P>
      <P>Consideration was given to the case for Ireland's participation in EXPO 2000 by the Foreign Earnings Committee, FEC. The FEC was of the view that participation at Hanover could not be justified on trade or investment promotion grounds but acknowledged that failure to participate, against a background of participation by all other EU member states, could be damaging to Ireland's overall relations with Germany. The decision to participate was therefore taken on broader foreign policy and cultural grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preliminary findings of the independent evaluators contracted to assess Ireland's partici<Col N="1518" /> pation would suggest that the impact on foreign investment or trade was indeed minimal. The evaluators do however believe that our participation is likely to have provided a return on taxpayers' funds, given the estimated tourism benefits, the national prestige/diplomatic issues and the other benefits in terms of the attraction of skills and the cultural issues. They are also of the view that the main focus of promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, with a secondary focus on skills attraction and food promotion, was appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a recent case in County Dublin involving an alleged case of pyramid selling and a robbery and I understand that the local Garda Síochána are investigating the case.</P>
      <P>The Pyramid Selling Act, 1980, was introduced to deal with pyramid or multilevel selling as it is sometimes called. The Act defines in some detail what is called a scheme. One of the elements which must be present in a selling scheme before it can be regarded as pyramid selling is that goods or services or both are to be provided by the promoter. The Act makes it an offence for a promoter or a participant in a scheme to induce or attempt to induce people to join a scheme. It is also an offence for a promoter or participant in a scheme to receive payment from participants by holding out that those participants will receive payments or benefits from introducing other persons into the scheme.</P>
      <P>I urge people to be vigilant when considering investing their money and if they feel that a scheme is one that is prohibited under the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980, they should contact the Garda Síochána who are the enforcing body for the Act.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of whether so-called gifting schemes are covered by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980, my Department is at present in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the matter. I understand that the Garda are of the view that such schemes are not covered by the 1980 Act.</P>

      <P>Since the Donegal Employment Initiative Task Force submitted its report to me in July 1999 a number of key recommendations have been implemented. These include improved access to the county, upgrading of skills, provision of industrial and enterprise space, investment in tourism, energy and telecommunications.</P>
      <P>The actions undertaken to improve access are as follows: funding of the order of £130 million has been committed for the national primary and national secondary roads in the county between 2000 and 2003; infrastructure improvements at City of Derry Airport and Donegal Airport &ndash; public service orders from City of Derry Airport and Donegal Airport to Dublin and £35 million investment in quay facilities in Killybegs with additional funding for harbours and piers throughout the county.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the upgrading of skills in the county additional funding of £4.2 million was made available to FÁS in Donegal. FÁS registration and skills analysis have been put in place. Capital investment was also made in the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, enabling the provision of additional courses.</P>
      <P>Industrial and enterprise space has been increased throughout County Donegal with the provision of 21 publicly owned sites. A further 29 publicly owned units have been provided for inward investment, community and indigenous enterprise. Civic offices have also been developed as public private partnerships to provide advanced office space.</P>
      <P>Tourism has been boosted in Donegal with the investment of £1 million on branding and ongoing promotional material. Lough Swilly boat park and peninsula hopping initiatives are at advanced stages of planning. Furthermore, a tourism section has been established as part of the Community and Enterprise Unit of Donegal County Council with a tourism manager and a tourism development officer. The development of a tourism strategy for the county as part of the Donegal county strategy is being prepared by Donegal County Development Board. This will position Donegal to bid for funding as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>Current plans for the development of broadband infrastructure to County Donegal will introduce high-speed access and competition to the telecommunications market in the county. Donegal County Council will prepare a bid for funding under the next round of Structural Funds for telecommunications. The extension of gas pipeline to County Donegal has been announced and may enable the provision of gas fired electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The £5 million Economic Development Fund established by Donegal County Council has been instrumental in leveraging many of the above initiatives. Further mechanisms will be established by Donegal County Development Board in association with Donegal County Council to ensure the integrated delivery of the recommendations of the Donegal Employment Initiative Task Force, thereby ensuring that the county is a prime and competitive location for job creation.</P>

      <P>Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights states: &ldquo;In the determination of his civil rights and obligations . . . everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing . . . by an independent and impartial tribunal . . .&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal was set up to provide a speedy, fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringements of their statutory rights. The ordinary members of the tribunal and of the Labour Court are appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the nomination of the social partners.</P>
      <P>The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, who as a general rule have legal qualifications, and the chairman and deputy chairmen of the Labour Court are all appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. These appointments are made after careful reflection and appropriate consultation.</P>
      <P>Rights Commissioners are appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from a list submitted by the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these bodies is independent in the performance of its functions and the Minister does not have any influence on their decision making processes. Except in the case of Labour Court recommendations in relation to industrial relations disputes, which are not binding on the parties, the decisions and determinations of each of the bodies can be appealed by the parties. <Col N="1521" /> Generally speaking, determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and decisions of the rights commissioners and the Labour Court are accepted by the parties and very few of them are appealed.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the event that any party is aggrieved by the procedures of any of these bodies, it is open to such party to apply for judicial review. I am satisfied therefore that the operation of all these bodies complies with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>Insurers offer cover based on underwriting experience as well as trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, past and potential. Decisions on the risks that the companies are prepared to underwrite are a matter for the companies themselves. EU law prohibits intervention in underwriting decisions by insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Over 300 EU insurers are authorised to write business on the Irish market in accordance with the terms of the directives establishing the Single Market. This brings the benefit of additional cover and competition to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>We are making a number of efforts to reduce the cost of insurance cover in Ireland. Such efforts include the work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>

The protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers.

In this regard the labour inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring the employment conditions of various categories of vulnerable workers, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate, in conducting its enforcement responsibilities across all sectors of the economy under the relevant labour legislation, operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation whatsoever with respect to nationality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two years IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional <Col N="1523" /> offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its HQ project divisions.</P>
    <P>Recently, IDA announced that additional posts would be transferred to Athlone, which will comprise staff from regions, property, and healthcare divisions bringing the staff complement up to 30. In addition, posts are being transferred to Sligo comprising staff from international services and consumer products divisions bringing the staff complement up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions, and to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's incentive package is also geared in favour of the Objective One regions which is in line with EU state aid limits. In the Objective One regions IDA has acquired a number of additional sites and also upgraded many of its sites to business park standard. Furthermore, it has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations.</P>
    <P>As a result of the above initiatives, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new greenfield investment projects have been secured for the Objective One regions. This is a strong result in that it came from intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the IDA team working in close partnership with the local authorities and the third level colleges and universities across the country. Despite the ongoing retrenchment in the US economy, which is the source of a significant proportion of overseas investment, IDA continues to strive towards maintaining this level of investment in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>However, improved access is crucial to attracting new overseas investment to the regions and in this context the importance of improved air and road access cannot be over emphasised. This has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which includes plans to bring our roads, railway and air services up to a standard consistent with a modern economy within the next six years. Availability of high quality telecommunications and energy supplies are also essential. IDA Ireland is keeping in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of IDA's priorities.</P>

      <P>Following the closure announcement, the company was immediately contacted by approximately 160 employers interested in hiring its staff. IDA Ireland remains in close contact with the company with a view to minimising the effects of the closure, by encouraging the outsourcing of activities currently carried out by the company. I understand that the company is involved in negotiations with a number of companies in this regard, with the possibility of transferring both business and personnel.</P>
      <P>In the last three weeks, FÁS has established an on-site employment office to assist employees in finding alternative employment. FÁS efforts are ongoing in this regard and over 300 people have already secured alternative employment. FÁS expects that the majority of remaining staff will be able to find employment in the near future. Twenty one companies from Dublin north attended a jobs fair, at the company, to recruit staff for their own operations and interviews are ongoing.</P>
      <P>Over 250 staff indicated that they wanted to take up FÁS evening classes in a range of skills and they have been accommodated in FÁS training centres in Finglas, Cabra and Baldoyle.</P>

      <P>The potential dangers posed to persons through exposure to asbestos fibres, or materials containing asbestos fibres, is well recognised.</P>
      <P>In the European Union, including Ireland, the placing on the market and use of any asbestos fibres and of products containing them intentionally added is now prohibited, other than in respect of a limited number of derogations, operative up to 1 January 2005, in the case of certain products containing chrysotile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive European Union derived legislation also exists for the protection of workers exposed to asbestos at work. Those provisions are transposed in Ireland through the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, as amended in 1993 and 2000. Those regulations are designed to provide protection to those workers involved in activities which may lead to possible exposure to asbestos fibres. Examples of such activities <Col N="1525" /> include removal of asbestos-containing materials, demolition and construction work or maintenance work.</P>
    <P>Also under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 1995, a preliminary health and safety plan must be drawn up by the project supervisor for design stage &ndash; PSDS &ndash; on most projects. This plan must specify, among other items, any particular risk that exists at the premises, including the presence of asbestos-containing materials. The PSDS should be aware of the age of the building and the typical construction materials used at the time of its construction and should be conscious of the possible presence of asbestos products. Where buildings are not being renovated or refurbished and it is thought that they may contain asbestos, occupiers have a duty under current legislation to identify.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment, CE, programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Through CE, participants are provided with valuable opportunities for development and training.</P>
      <P>Following a restructuring of the programme approved by the Government in 1999, participation levels are gradually being reduced to 28,000 by the end of 2003, as part of a phased reduction reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed. The mainstreaming of schools services is currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services including the health and environmental sectors will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme.</P>
      <P>A small number of individuals continue to experience difficulties in getting jobs following their participation on CE due to barriers such as age, health, literacy, numeracy or a lack of suitable jobs locally. In recognition of this, I have also recently introduced greater flexibility with regard to such participants, particularly in the case of older workers. FÁS, now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis for these participants. FÁS is currently increasing the training and development inputs on the CE programme to provide a more focused response to the needs of disadvantaged persons.</P>

    <P>On the question of airline advertising in the wider sense, the advertising industry has its own self-regulatory body, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland &ndash; ASAI.

      <P>Many of the world's leading high technology companies are experiencing stagnant or falling market demand and have had to retrench their operations worldwide. The Irish operations of the global ICT companies that are experiencing job losses or closures attribute their difficulties to global factors and not to problems inherent in the Irish economy. They state the causes principally as loss of sales for their particular product, European and world downturn in the global ICT industry, increasing global competitiveness or overcapacity due to the buoyancy of recent years.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy is to focus intensely on ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive location for the ICT sector. This will help to mitigate the worst effects of the downturn and ensure that we are well placed to benefit from the undoubted long-term growth potential of the sector. Key issues in this respect include: implementing the NDP on schedule, particularly the rollout of infrastructure into the regions; maintaining the competitiveness of the economy by controlling wage and price inflation; enhancing our skills base by continuing to tailor education and training to market needs; and encouraging existing companies to undertake value-added functions in Ireland to ensure that the products and services located here are not competing purely on cost.</P>
      <P>Despite recent bad news, the basic building blocks are in place and we still have an immensely strong international reputation in this vital industry. For the moment it will be important for the development agencies to liaise closely with their client companies and, particularly in the context of multinational companies, support the favourable positioning of Irish located operations in the context of restructuring decisions made by global parents.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 181 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that IDA Ireland has expressed its sympathy with the individuals, families and US companies in Ireland who may have relatives, friends and colleagues involved in the awful events on 11 September last.</P>
      <P>With regard to the impact on new overseas investment it is not possible at this time to predict the full effects of the recent atrocities. However, there is no doubt that new foreign direct investment, FDI, business will be adversely affected by both these events and the world economic downturn.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that Ireland is well placed to win overseas investment in the current climate and into the future, IDA through its network of overseas offices is increasing the number of targeted marketing visits abroad in the light of the current reluctance of many overseas companies to use aircraft; working closely with senior management in a range of overseas companies who have expressed an interest in overseas investment in an effort to ensure that they are aware of the advantages of locating in Ireland and to encourage them to arrange a site visit at an early date; continuing to build on existing contacts in companies who are in sectors targeted by IDA but who have no existing plans for overseas investment, in an effort to encourage them to consider investing in Ireland and targeting companies in niche product areas as part of an approach to develop clusters of excellence in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition, in order to maximise the potential of the existing base of IDA client companies and to minimise job losses, IDA is working to ensure that they become more embedded in the Irish economy and that they are constantly moving up the value chain in terms of their Irish operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> As part of this process IDA is remaining in contact with client company management in Ireland and overseas to ensure that their Irish operations secure a wider corporate mandate and become a vital part of the corporate value chain &ndash; thus helping to ensure the growth and long-term survival of the company in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this context, IDA's objective is to persuade client companies to add strategic functions in Ireland such as R&amp;D, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics, and shared services.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in order to gain from the next upturn in the global economy, the business environment for overseas companies is being improved by enhancing our skill base by continuing to tailor education and training to market needs, reducing the non-completion rates in higher education, building our road and housing and telecoms infrastructure and ensuring that future cost increases are in line with EU norms and shaping the regulatory environment &ndash; planning laws labour laws etc. &ndash; to ensure that Ireland is a place where companies can operate with flexibility, agility and speed.</P>

      <Quest> the number of redundancies or job losses notified to her Department during 2000 and to date in 2001; the number of anticipated job losses reported to her Department to date in 2001; if her attention has been drawn to the particular problems of job losses in the technology sector; the measures she will put in place to deal with these losses; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 13,316 proposed redundancies were notified to my Department in 2000. In the first nine months of 2001, 14,031 proposed redundancies were notified.</P>
      <P>With regard to the technology sector, the particular problems which that sector in Ireland is experiencing at present are a reflection of events in that industry globally. Many of the world's leading high technology companies are experiencing stagnant or falling market demand and have had to retrench their operations worldwide. The Irish operations of the global ICT companies that are experiencing job losses or closures attribute their difficulties to global factors and not to problems inherent in the Irish economy. They state the causes principally as loss of sales for their particular product, European and world downturn in the global ICT industry, increasing global competitiveness or overcapacity due to the buoyancy of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's strategy is to focus intensely on ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive location for the ICT sector. This will help to miti<Col N="1530" /> gate the worst effects of the downturn and ensure that we are well placed to benefit from the undoubted long-term growth potential of the sector. Key issues in this respect include implementing the NDP on schedule, particularly the rollout of infrastructure into the regions; maintaining the competitiveness of the economy by controlling wage and price inflation; enhancing our skills base by continuing to tailor education and training to market needs and encouraging existing companies to undertake value-added functions in Ireland to ensure that the products and services located here are not competing purely on cost.</P>
    <P>Despite recent bad news, the basic building blocks are in place and we still have an immensely strong international reputation in this vital industry. For the moment it will be important for the development agencies to liaise closely with their client companies and, particularly in the context of multinational companies, support the favourable positioning of Irish located operations in the context of restructuring decisions made by global parents. The ICT industry will continue to be a dynamic, growing sector of the world's economy and we are determined that Ireland will maintain the leading position we have earned over the last decade.</P>

      <P>One hundred and twelve female apprentices are registered with FÁS in the standards based apprenticeship system at this time. This compares with 24,885 male apprentices currently registered with FÁS and indicates that the relative level of female participation continues to be very low.</P>
      <P>Apprentice recruitment is the function of employers. FÁS, as the body with overall responsibility for the apprenticeship system, cannot therefore dictate the numbers of men and women recruited. However, FÁS is proactive in encouraging greater female participation in apprenticeship by offering a bursary of £2,100 to employers on behalf of each female apprentice recruited.</P>
      <P>In addition, FÁS staff regularly visits secondary schools where they outline training options, including apprenticeship training, to all students, male and female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of FÁS has recently reconvened the National Apprenticeship Committee to advise it on a range of issues in relation to apprenticeship. The committee's terms of reference specifically provide for it to advise on approaches needed to encourage more equality of access to, and participation in, apprenticeship. I am bringing the <Col N="1531" /> Deputy's concerns to the attention of the committee in that regard.</P>

      <P>Following this Government's decision to establish a Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and in accordance with that decision, an interdepartmental implementation group was set up to progress the establishment of the new board. The group has had a number of meetings.</P>
      <P>This group is examining the operational issues surrounding the establishment of an assessment board and the legal implications, including what legislative changes, if any, will be necessary to establish the PIAB. The work includes consideration of how the board should actually work in practice and the procedures it should adopt. The group expects to report by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation for work related injuries, in its initial term of operation, and later in motor injury cases by reducing the delivery costs of compensation. There is no intention to reduce the amount paid to claimants. The level of awards made by the board will conform to the awards made by the courts.</P>

      <P>In general, asylum seekers do not have the right to work pending a final decision on their applications. However, as an exceptional measure, the Government agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who were in the State for more than 12 months at that date and who were awaiting a final decision on their application for refugee status should be given the right to work. The decision did not apply to persons who applied for asylum after 26 July 1999.

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has advised that at the end of March 2001 of the 3,535 eligible to work, approximately 1,500 were no longer claiming unemployment assistance or social welfare assistance.</P>

It sets out the duties of both employers and employees in relation to a provision and maintenance of a safe working environment.

Under sections 6 and 7 of the Act, it is the primary duty of every employer to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees, and that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety and health.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for Irish owned or controlled firms, with a workforce of over ten employees which have demonstrated that they want or have the potential to grow, in those parts <Col N="1533" /> of the country which are under its responsibility. Shannon Development provides support to this size of enterprise in the areas of north Tipperary, south and south west Offaly, north Kerry, Limerick and Clare.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland's overall objectives in relation to its client base, including companies in this range, are set out in the three year strategy for Enterprise Ireland 1999-01. This strategy has a number of objectives such as the increasing scale of Irish industry, doubling the number of new businesses being established, increasing productivity of small business and doubling the number of firms undertaking research and development.</P>
      <P>To accomplish these objectives, Enterprise Ireland provides financial and/or non-financial supports to its clients. In order to avail of Enterprise Ireland financial support client companies are facilitated to review the key business functions in their enterprises and to agree jointly with Enterprise Ireland a series of actions to address any perceived weaknesses. Having completed such a review and agreed a development plan for the future, the company may avail of a range of financial supports in order to achieve the targets set out in the development plan.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland initiatives include skills development, best practice workshops, mentoring service, product development, access to finance, market development service and the provision of links between the third level sector and industry.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development operates similar initiatives for its clients in the area of the country under its aegis.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment policy document, July 1998, establishes that CEBs are the first point of contact for start up and micro enterprises under ten employees and Enterprise Ireland for those over ten employees. It points out, however, that new growth firms have a critical role to play in the upgrading and transformation of our industrial base and therefore close co-operation is required between Enterprise Ireland and the CEBs to ensure that the potential of those firms is maximised. To that end, it establishes, <i>inter alia</i>, that Enterprise Ireland will identify existing CEB clients whose growth prospects suggest that they will become clients of Enterprise Ireland and to facilitate a smooth transition from one agency to another and ensure that high potential start up companies approaching the CEBs are referred to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>This policy has been implemented and, in support of this, a formal working relationship document was agreed between Enterprise Ireland and the CEBs in November 2000. As part of this process EI executives continue to act as members of CEBs and their respective evaluation committees.</P>

      <P>The recently announced increases in the price of electricity were approved by the Commission for Electricity Regulation, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Public Enterprise. The likely effect of such increases on Irish companies would have been one of the factors taken into account by the commission in reaching its decision.</P>
      <P>In fact, the result of the commission's review is an 8.6% increase in the average price of electricity. The percentage increases for the different categories of business customers are as follows: small businesses &ndash; 3%, medium sized businesses &ndash; 13% and large businesses &ndash; 14%. In addition &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; customers can choose to have their electricity supplied to them by ESB in its capacity as public electricity supplier or by one of the licensed independent electricity suppliers. It is expected that with effect from February 2002, electricity market opening will increase to 40% and approximately 1,600 customers, whose annual consumption is at least 1 GWh, will be free to choose their electricity supplier. The independent power producers will provide eligible customers with the opportunity to negotiate improved prices and, when new efficient power plants are constructed, such customers will have the opportunity to source even more competitively priced electricity in the open market.</P>
      <P>It must be accepted, in general, that Ireland currently has a shortage of electricity generation capacity and that there is an urgent need for investment in transmission and distribution capacity. The price of electricity must reflect the economic cost of production and distribution in addition to impact on categories of consumers. If prices were maintained at their present non-cost reflective levels, then, as happened in California, new generators would not enter the market resulting in serious capacity concerns.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 to 179, inclusive, and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The labour market continues to perform extremely well. In the period to the second quarter 2001, the latest period for which CSO data is available, the labour force grew by 36,300 to reach a level of 1.78 million people. This includes an additional 45,800 people at work and a further fall in unemployment to 65,400. The unemployment rate has declined to 3.7%.</P>
      <P>While there have been a number of announcements regarding redundancies in recent months, these have not as yet translated into any significant increase in unemployment. It is too early to predict in concrete terms what impact the recent tragic events in the US will have on the global economy and in turn on employment. The ESRI, in its recently published medium term review, suggested that in the event of a sharp slowdown, unemployment could double in the next two years but thereafter the economy was in a position to return to strong growth and full employment. It advised, therefore, that current medium term strategies should remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has in place a comprehensive strategy to meet labour market challenges. The strategy, as described in Ireland's Employment Action Plan 2001, is aimed at mobilising labour supply from all available sources and providing the necessary education, training and lifelong learning opportunities to ensure that supply matches demand and that employed persons and those seeking employment have the required skills. This strategy remains valid and appropriate. Key elements of the policies being pursued include fiscal measures aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of taking up a job and remaining in work, measures aimed at upskilling persons in employment and those seeking work, active labour market programmes to assist unemployed disadvantaged persons in their transition to employment, placement services for job seekers and employers as well as direct intervention with <Col N="1536" /> persons on the live register with a view to preventing their drift into long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is a large range and scale of programmes available to assist the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in their transition to employment. These include a range of FÁS training, retraining and work experience programmes. The 2001 FÁS Estimate, at 819 million, enables FÁS to provide training and employment places for almost 100,000 people. The resources dedicated by FÁS to assist target groups are augmented through additional programme provision including the back to work allowance scheme and the vocational education and training opportunities scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a comprehensive strategy to meet current and future labour market challenges is being pursued to meet the labour supply and demand needs of the economy, to meet the needs of unemployed persons in the event of job losses arising from company closures and to ensure that sufficient resources are in place to deliver on the policies and actions required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence available to my Department or the industrial development agencies of any increasing tendency for firms to relocate to lower wage economies. The reasons for relocation are many, varied and complex, and on balance this country has benefited from such movement in recent years due to the underlying strength of our economy.</P>
      <P>In order to maximise the potential of our existing base of overseas companies and to minimise job losses, IDA Ireland is encouraging them to add strategic functions including research and development, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics and shared services. In this way, such firms will move up the value chain and become more embedded in the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a broader context, the Government is continuing to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network through the national development plan and the <Col N="1537" /> upcoming national spatial strategy, and shaping the regulatory environment for enterprise.</P>

      <P>The main function of ministerial led trade missions is to assist companies to develop contacts in the target market. The presence of a Minister not only helps to attract attention to the mission itself and to Ireland generally, it also provides an impetus to ongoing negotiations and helps companies to cement existing relationships.</P>
      <P>In November last year I launched a drive in which Enterprise Ireland will work with Irish building materials suppliers to improve their already strong presence in the British market. The launch took place in the Irish Embassy in London and was attended by nine Irish companies and seven of the leading national and regional builders merchants in Great Britain. Sales as a direct result of this event are estimated at £1.3 million, although in the long-term the clear focus on this key market will have much larger results.</P>
      <P>In March this year I led a trade mission to Japan, in place of the Taoiseach who was unable to travel because of developments in the peace process. The mission consisted of 47 companies, the largest ever trade mission from Ireland to Asia, with strong representation of the ICT/software and education sectors. Contracts with an estimated value of £21 million were signed during the trade mission.</P>
      <P>In Japan I also conducted a series of meetings with the presidents of four Japanese companies. One of those companies has begun the expansion of its research and development facility in Limerick which I was pleased to announce after our meeting. Another company which I met is examining the possibility of locating a new project in Europe and the IDA is now in negotiation with the company with a view to bringing their project to Ireland. I also addressed a meeting of the Japan Ireland Economic Association which was attended by 250 leading Japanese business people interested in connecting with Irish partners or in the possibility of locating new investments in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May, I led a trade mission to the United Arab Emirates and to Oman. Twenty companies, principally from the ICT and education sectors, participated in this mission. The political meetings which I conducted contributed to developing the knowledge and understanding <Col N="1538" /> of Ireland's capability as an economic partner in this region. Given the prominent role of Government in the Gulf States' economies, political meetings of this nature have a particular importance in developing our trade relations with this region.</P>
    <P>I participated in the &ldquo;Software Partner&rdquo; event in Milan, also in May, which brought eight leading Irish software companies into contact with over 50 Italian companies in the sector. The purpose of this event was to assist Irish companies to develop strategic partnerships for the Italian market. To date, five Irish companies have established strategic relationships with Italian partners met during the event.</P>
    <P>This September, I travelled to Australia with 35 companies on a trade mission to Sydney and Melbourne. During the mission, ten agreements covering supply and distribution arrangements were signed. I also opened Ireland's stand at Australia's Showcase trade fair, which focuses on the ICT sector; Ireland was the only foreign country with its own stand, a reflection of the high regard in which our industry is held. Also in Sydney I addressed a seminar organised by the IDA on the IFSC. This seminar was attended by about 100 executives from Australia's leading financial services companies.</P>
    <P>On all the missions outlined above, I also engaged in interviews with the local media to highlight the importance of the trade mission and to improve Ireland's visibility as a competitive source of supply and location for investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the pivotal role the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has in relation to the Corrib field development, it was anxious to be kept informed of any approvals being issued by other State agencies concerning the development and, therefore, asked Mayo County Council to be informed of any approval being given by it. In the event, Mayo County Council did not make contact with my Department in regard to its decision in relation to the application.</P>
      <P>My Department has the following role in relation to seeking wayleaves from land owners for the laying of an onshore pipeline where an application is made to the Minister by the developers of the Corrib field for the compulsory acquisition of wayleaves. There are two legal mechanisms under which compulsory acquisition of wayleaves can be obtained, that is, section 23 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and section 32 of the Gas Act, 1976, the functions of which in relation to upstream pipelines fall within my remit.</P>
      <P>Under section 23 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, I can compulsorily acquire land and ancillary rights, including wayleaves, either permanently or temporarily. Upon the grant of a petroleum lease by me or at any time during the term of the lease, I can grant the lessee a permit to use any land or any ancillary rights acquired by me. Under section 32 of the Gas Act, 1976, the developer of the Corrib field may apply to me for an order to acquire compulsorily any ancillary right over land. In the event of an acquisition order being made by me it will be subject to such restrictions and other terms and conditions, if any, as specified by me. The order shall vest in the developers the interest specified in the order in such land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>With the introduction of the national sheep identification system, Ireland has, for the first time, full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis. Every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcass processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged by 15 December next. I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the various requirements which it has been designed to address, the NSIS system is simple to understand and operate. It avails of opportunities offered by modern technology and is also cost efficient from the perspec<Col N="1544" /> tives of flock owners, processors, tag suppliers, the Department and purchasers of Irish sheepmeat. I accept that it does impose a measure of additional work on flock owners and others, but this will be the case with any worthwhile system of identification and traceability. I regard such extra effort as an investment in the future of the sector and in its capacity to meet the requirements of markets and ever more discerning consumers. It should also be recognized that individual identification provides the flock owner with a valuable management tool, a fact which has been publicly recognized by a number of flock owners since NSIS became operational.</P>
    <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of NSIS on an ongoing basis and will address any significant difficulties should they arise. I am pleased to report that the system generally is working well and that sheep presented in marts and factories are properly tagged and documented. I look forward to full compliance by flock owners with the requirement that all sheep remaining on holdings are tagged no later than 15 December next.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that to date more than eight million tags have been issued by approved suppliers to almost 40,000 flock owners. While I regard the introduction of NSIS as a major achievement, I regard it as a system which can be built upon and which can evolve in line with technological advances and the requirements of the sector as a whole.</P>

This means that the amount of quota available for distribution from the national reserve in 2003 will be limited to the quota derived from the deductions made as a result of the sale of quota in 2003. This is estimated at 2,500 premium rights. Individual quotas will not be reduced as a result of the implementation of this regulation.</P>

      <P>Meat processing companies fall within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector. One provision of the EU guidelines for State aid in the agricultural sector stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises that comply fully with minimum standards. Thus, aid for development may be granted to enterprises that comply with existing minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment.</P>
      <P>Under the recently launched national development plan for the food sector, provision has been made to assist capital projects in the livestock sector, including the processing sector. The rate of aid is 40% of approved eligible costs and generally investments exceeding 100,000 or £80,000 will be considered for assistance. Eligible projects will be assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Possibilities also exist under the NDP for grant aid in the areas of human resource development and marketing and promotion. With regard to human resource development, a national programme to address the needs of the food processing industry will be managed by Enterprise Ireland to cover such areas as food safety and marketing training, competitiveness and improved productivity, management development and innovation management. Measures relating to marketing and promotion will be implemented by An Bord Bia. The objective of this measure is to support the marketing and promotion of food and drinks products by helping in the development of new markets and the expansion of current ones.</P>

As the amount paid was greater than his average headage payment of £1,046.00 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation for loss under the area based scheme is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural <Col N="1548" /> boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    <P>The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.

      <P>The Department's &ldquo;Economic Review and Outlook&rdquo;, ERO, published in August, revised the 2001 GDP growth forecast downwards to 7.2%, from 8.8% projected at budget time last December. Growth in GNP terms for 2001 was also revised, from 7.4% at budget time to 6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factors contributing to this revision were the continuing slowdown in the major world <Col N="1550" /> economies and the restrictions put in place to successfully contain the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which adversely impacted on the tourism and farming sectors of our economy. The recent terrorist attacks in the United States seem likely to further dampen global economic prospects, with a recovery in the United States not now generally expected until the middle of 2002 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>This will have adverse implications for the Irish economy. A revised forecast will be published with budget 2002. However, I have no doubt that with the right approach the Irish economy can pass through these short-term difficulties and as the global economic environment improves, that we can return to sustainable, solid levels of economic growth in the medium term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget for the year 2000 a sum of £2.5 million was provided for special works to alleviate the effects of flooding in south Galway. I established a steering group in January 2000 to bring forward proposals for the most efficient usage of those funds. The group comprises representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Galway County Council and the Office of Public Works. The group has been examining the feasibility of a number of schemes for the following areas &ndash; Cregaclare, Mannin Cross, Kilchreest, Termon, Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen and a number of culvert sites in the Kinvara area. The group has met on six occasions to date. The scheme at the most advanced stage of preparation is that for Cregaclare. Documentation for public exhibition of the scheme is nearing completion and further information on cost benefit is also being prepared.</P>
      <P>The proposed schemes for Mannin Cross, Kilchreest and Termon all involve transferring large volumes of water adjoining river catchments and accordingly require complex investigation and assessment in order to determine downstream impacts. These areas are being monitored on an ongoing basis by consultants and final project reports on feasibility are awaited. Pending the outcome of these investigations into the feasibility of the schemes, it is not possible to give any commitment to work programmes or definitive timescales for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme at Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen involves significant environmental issues. There is also an existing privately executed scheme there. These private works and the surrounding <Col N="1551" /> area have been surveyed by Office of Public Works and are currently the subject of ongoing review in the Office of Public Works in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In relation to the two culvert sites in the Kinvara area which were identified for possible works in the south Galway flood report, Office of Public Works has instructed Galway County Council to proceed with the works up to a total of approximately £200,000, the costs to be recouped from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>To date, approximately £262,000 of the £2.5 million allocated to south Galway flood relief works has been committed. This is made up of £62,000 in respect of consultants' studies and reports and £200,000 to Galway County Council in respect of the carrying out of culvert works in the Kinvara area.</P>

      <P>Maintenance work which was scheduled to have been carried out on the Silver River were deferred following consultation with the regional fisheries board, in order to minimise the impact of the work on the salmonid spawning season.</P>

      <P>On 27 July 2001 the chairperson of the tribunal, Judge Lindsay, ruled on an application by the IHS for the tribunal to carry out an investigation of the US-based pharmaceutical companies. Judge Lindsay said that the tribunal has investigated any matters arising outside the State which are relevant to her terms of reference by means of hearing evidence from international experts, <Col N="1552" /> and has heard a considerable amount of detailed evidence on these issues. The tribunal has also investigated relevant communications between the pharmaceutical companies and relevant persons in the State. Judge Lindsay said that her terms of reference do not require her to undertake an investigation into the activities of the pharmaceutical companies.</P>
      <P>The IHS wrote to me on 6 September 2001 seeking an extension to the tribunal's terms of reference which would enable it to carry out an investigation into US-based pharmaceutical companies. I met with representatives of the IHS on 27 September in order to hear their concerns at first hand.</P>
      <P>Under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, the terms of reference of a tribunal can only be amended where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation with the Attorney General on behalf of the relevant Minister, or where the tribunal itself has requested the amendment. This consultation process is now in train.</P>

      <P>I have agreed to provide funding of £11 million (13.97 million) to enable the Western Health Board to purchase Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood. The Order took a decision a few years back to withdraw from control of the hospital. Discussions on transferring the ownership of the hospital to the Western Health Board have now concluded.</P>
      <P>Portiuncula has played an important role in the provision of public hospital services in the region and it was important that it be retained as a provider of public hospital services. With the acquisition of Portiuncula the integrated strategic development of hospital services for the region will be assured.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the continued development of acute hospital services in the Western Health Board region. The question of developing acute hospital services at Portiuncula will be considered in the context of the additional funding available for the development of acute hospital services in the region during 2002, the competing priorities for development and the Western Health Board's service plan for 2002.</P>

      <P>The allowances to be paid in respect of children placed in care under the Child Care (Placement of children in foster care) and the Child Care (Placement of children with relatives) Regulations 1995 have been increased from £71.55 (90.85) to £200 (254) per week for a child under 12 and from £85.75 (108.88) to £220 (279) per week for a child of 12 and over, from 1 August this year. This payment incorporates the orphan's pension and allowances payments. The new scheme was introduced as a result of the recommendations made in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care &ndash; A Child Centred Partnership. The report recommended that discretionary payments, made by health boards to foster carers be abolished, and that the allowances be increased to the new rates. The report further recommended, in view of the new allowances, that orphan's pensions and allowances should not be paid in respect of children in foster care.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to implement the new scheme exactly in the manner set out in the report. The new scheme however is designed to achieve the objective of the report, which is to provide foster carers with an adequate allowance to look after their foster children. It should be noted that prior to the 1 August the orphan's allowance/pension was paid in respect of a minority of children in foster care. The revised arrangements will ensure that all children in foster care are treated equally. The recommendations regarding allowances are only part of a much wider set of recommendations designed to ensure that the structures and services necessary to meet the needs of children in foster care, their families and foster carers will be strengthened and further developed.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report on a phased basis and as part of that commitment, in addition to introducing the new allowances, has already established the working group to draw up national standards on practices and procedures in foster care, as recommended in the report. The implementation of the report's recommendations reflects the Government's overall commitment to strengthen and further develop the child welfare and protection services.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Mental handicap is one of the conditions prescribed under the Act. Drugs which are directly related to the treatment of these conditions are made available free of charge. The operation of the scheme, known as the long-term illness scheme, is primarily a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>Persons who have been diagnosed with any of the illnesses prescribed under the Act, including mental handicap, should apply to their local health board for admission to the scheme. Once eligible, they are issued with a long-term illness book which lists the drugs and medicines which will be provided to them free of charge through their community pharmacist.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is, by legislation, solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

These include: a two year defects warranty to protect the purchaser in the event of water and smoke penetration in the two years after completion, introduced in 1990. Previously no warranty was provided for; the warranty to protect the purchaser in the event of structural faults developing in the home was extended from six to ten years in January 1995. This warranty was also extended to cover refurbished dwellings from 1 July 1999, where work commenced on or after that date; financial indemnities to protect purchasers against loss of deposits or stage payments through the bankruptcy or liquidation of the builder were also introduced in January 1995 and; a system for assessment of minor complaints was introduced with effect from 1 January 2001.</P>

      <P>Draft regulations in relation to the proposed introduction of a levy on plastic shopping bags, with effect from 4 February 2002, were released for public consultation last month. The draft regulations propose that the levy will apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at the point of sale in supermarkets, service stations or other sales outlets, except (i) for food safety reasons, those bags which are used to contain fresh meat, fish and poultry, whether packaged or not; (ii) smaller bags which are used to contain non-packaged fruit, nuts or vegetables, confectionery dairy products and cooked food, whether cold or hot, and; (iii) those bags designed for reuse, which are used to contain goods or products, and which are sold to customers for a sum of not less than 70 cent each.</P>
      <P>Annex II of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste as transposed by the Waste Management (Packaging) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998, outlines the essential requirements of packaging placed on the market by producers and provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the composition of packaging should be sufficiently robust to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and the consumer. As, under these provisions, products are required to be adequately packaged to prevent leakage or leaching, it is not proposed to exempt from the levy any plastic bags dispensed at retail outlets to consumers for the purpose of separately holding purchases of noxious fluids or other hazardous substances.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to receive a payment a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare or health board payment and satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, in recent years I have extended the duration of the fuel season from 26 weeks to 29 weeks and introduced substantial improvements in the means test which mean that a person may now have a combined household income of up to £40 (50.79) per week or savings/investments of up to £30,000 (38,092) over and above the maximum contributory pension rate and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. To remove the means test for people <Col N="1563" /> over 70 years or to pay fuel allowances to recipients of the old age pension would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

Accordingly orphans payments which were formerly paid by my Department on behalf of some children in foster care, are now being paid on behalf of all foster children. Since August 2001 the orphans payment is paid directly to the health board on behalf of and for the benefit of each child in foster care. It is also the case that an orphan payment will continue to be paid in respect of eligible children up to age 22 where they are in full-time education.</P>
    <P>This change in arrangements addresses many of the concerns raised by the Irish Foster Care Association concerning the involvement of my Department in foster care situations. It also accords with their strong recommendations that the foster care allowance should be inclusive of all former discretionary payments and entitlements.</P>

      <P>Officials from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department were concerned that works at this site, which is within Barroughter bog candidate special area of conservation (cSAC) No. 231 would have a negative impact on the ecological value of the cSAC. In order to protect the conservation value of the site the contractor was requested to cease activities. Dúchas officials did not, at any stage, require that machinery be retained on site or prevent its removal. Following a meeting between committee members, representing the turf cutters, and my officials a formula was agreed which will allow operations to proceed with minimal impact on the conservation value of the site. Written confirmation outlining the measures considered necessary to protect the site has issued to the committee.</P>
      <P>Proposed works on bogs within cSACs are individually assessed in the context of the condition, location and size of the bog involved. I am unaware of the bogs in County Roscommon to which the Deputy refers but if he can provide details of the locations involved and the works proposed I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

    <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that Operation Trace is currently reviewing a number of high profile cases and that all possible avenues of investigation are being thoroughly pursued. I am further informed that a full investigation is carried out in each case where a person is taken to be genuinely missing and that all missing persons investigations continuously remain open. The one exception to this rule is a &lsquo;presumed drowned' case. This occurs when a coroner, under section 23 of the Coroners Act, 1962, is satisfied that a death has occurred within his or her jurisdiction and the likelihood is that no body will be recovered. In this instance the coroner can declare the person dead and the investigation is then closed.</P>

      <P>Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in the north of Dublin city centre, O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas, in the south of the city centre, around Grafton Street and in Tralee, County Kerry. A Garda CCTV system is currently being installed in Cork city.</P>
      <P>The use of high technology cameras in combination with additional Garda personnel resources has had a significant effect in making urban centres safer places. I think, however, that it would be wrong to assume that the installation of CCTV systems will solve all policing problems. Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing resources and, as such, must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. CCTV systems are not a replacement for uniformed gardaí on patrol.</P>
      <P>Benefits of CCTV systems to the Garda Síochána include more effective management of resources, detection of events as they occur and filmed evidence of events. Video evidence may also lead to guilty pleas and consequent reductions in court costs. The level of success of CCTV can be gauged by the number of communities which have sought the introduction of Garda CCTV systems. In this regard, the advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications has received in excess of 50 applications and expressions of interest for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced an expansion of Garda CCTV systems last year. As part of the first tranche, systems will be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, <Col N="1569" /> Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. Systems will be in place in at least six more areas by 2003 and they will be announced in due course. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and will be addressed when detailed costings are available. Tenders have been received and are currently being evaluated in respect of town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. It is intended to seek tenders for Athlone, Clondalkin, Waterford and Tallaght by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. I plan to introduce a grant scheme to cater for communities which would like to press ahead independently with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

Access to this scheme, is through school principals in the case of primary schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service, and through NEPS in the case of all other schools.

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) was established on 1 September 1999, with delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department.</P>
      <P>The expansion of NEPS is currently under way in line with a plan that provides for its development in a phased and equitable manner and with a target number of 200 psychologists. The plan provides for a gradual expansion in the primary sector until all schools have access to the service, while improving the level of service in the post-primary sector. Staffing levels in the NEPS have doubled from 43 psychologists initially to 88 at present. My Department has initiated a further competition for the recruitment of additional psychologists before the end of the calendar year. I also announced during the summer that arrangements have been made to enable the full complement of 200 NEPS psychologists to be appointed by the end of 2002, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, however, that the phased nature of the NEPS expansion has caused difficulties in <Col N="1575" /> cases of special educational needs where psychological assessments are urgently required. In that context, I have allocated special funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS sent details of this scheme to all schools in August.</P>

Tuition will be free for persons or their dependants who are unemployed, medical card holders, family income supplement holders or holders of means tested welfare payments. The continued payment of welfare entitlements will be subject to the discretion of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Persons not in the above categories who are unwaged and have less than upper secondary education will be able to access the back to education scheme on a part-time basis at a reduced charge, equal to 30% of tuition costs. All other participants will be charged fees. The aim of the scheme is to encourage increased flexibility in provision so that learners can maximise the benefit they derive from courses when combining work and family responsibilities with a return to education. In the first phase of the initiative, 4000 places will come on stream at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment of the school in question decreased from 180 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 171 pupils on 30 September 2000. The latter enrolment entitles the school to a principal and five mainstream class teachers for the school year 2001-02. This is the authorised staffing for the school. In addition, the school has a resource teacher for pupils with special needs, a resource teacher for Travellers, a resource teacher and the services of a learning support teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As previously outlined in my reply to Deputy Connaughton's Parliamentary Question No. 389, on 26 June 2001, in relation to this case, higher education grants schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that Galway County Council, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, has not, as yet, received an application from the student in question. The student should therefore contact Galway County Council with a view to having her eligibility for grant assistance assessed, by reference to the terms and conditions of the higher education grant scheme relevant to the year of entry to her course.</P>
