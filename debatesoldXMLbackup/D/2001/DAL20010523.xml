      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could be aware that Intel employs 4,500 people in this country. Yesterday its general manager delivered a damning verdict on the Government's economic policies. In particular he described the decision in the last budget to abolish the ceiling on employers' PRSI as a major own goal. He then said that &ldquo;our wage costs are moving faster than in many other competing countries and we do ourselves no favours in making decisions that further erode our competitiveness and damage our international reputation&rdquo;. Given that the PRSI decision will have a big impact on firms in the technology sector and that 4,000 people have already been laid off in this sector this year, will the Taoiseach agree that this own goal should be reversed immediately and that the decision to raise the PRSI ceiling should now be reversed to ensure our competitiveness and international reputation are not damaged any further? </P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the primary benefits a Government can bring to an open market economy, such as ours, is consultation with the social partners and deliberations in relation to changes in tax policy prior to their implementation, as has been the case with successive Administrations? Will he indicate why this change was introduced without any consultation with the social partners prior to its announcement by the Minister for Finance? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate about this through December and January led IBEC to state that it did not like it because it means IBEC must pay more resources. The Government, in turn, has made the point that the enormous reductions in taxation in each of the past few Finance Acts <Col N="1357" /> gives hundreds of millions of pounds back to the these companies in the private sector. Their tax bill has been lightened considerably. This year the Minister for Finance introduced the software options particularly for companies such as Intel and other technology companies which lobbied the Government so they would have an advantage over other companies. Deputy Quinn mentioned consultation with the social partners. He will be aware consultation has led to agreement with the social partners. Many of the trade union movements have stated this is an unfair advantage to give to companies such as Intel and others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has also said that issues put forward by IBEC on behalf of the technology companies will be considered in his next Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>This Government has been extremely helpful and generous to these organisations in every policy it has adopted. I know they are going through a difficult time and that the American downturn has created difficulties for them. However, it is not unreasonable when we are substantially reducing corporation tax on these companies to take some resources back. All the consultations about tax measures did not take place before the budget for obvious reasons because if we did that, there would be other difficulties. I acknowledge this issue created considerable anxiety for Mr. Turlough O'Sullivan, the head of IBEC, the chairman of IBEC and others at the time. I and the Minister for Finance have attended several meetings in recent months. I know Deputy Quinn heard me make remarks about this at the IBEC lunch a few weeks ago in the presence of the chairman of IBEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may not be aware that 200 redundancies were announced in Dell overnight. This is also a topical issue. For over seven years now all Administrations, including the rainbow Government when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, created an image of a pro-business environment. The Taoiseach is now beginning to establish an anti-business image for this country. He is raising the PRSI ceiling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation, particularly fuel inflation, is going out of control. The Administration is in bad odour in Brussels. Does the Taoiseach not consider it an inopportune time to antagonise the business sector, particularly the technological sector, when the shadow from America is overhanging our economy and every international technological firm in the United States is <Col N="1358" /> looking for redundancies and is cutting back on jobs and on strategic decisions to establish in Europe? </P>

      <P>I take it from his contribution that the Taoiseach will not be refunding the money, notwithstanding the dismay of many people about the relationship between business and the funding of political parties. I would like to take the Taoiseach at his word regarding the intentions of this Government to meet its commitments. I remind him that in May 2000, this House passed unopposed the Second Stage of the Labour Party Bill on electoral donations. On 4 December 2000, the Taoiseach published a comprehensive article in <i>The Irish Times</i> setting out his plans. On 15 December&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting my question. On 15 December 2000, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000. On the same day, he issued a press statement to say that there would be additional amendments to the published Bill. In March 2001, that Bill went through Second Stage in the Seanad but all that is to be done there is not yet complete. The amendments are yet to be published. Repeatedly throughout this year, the Taoiseach has undertaken to deal with this issue. What more do we need to see coming out of Dublin Castle before the Taoiseach is shamed into action, and before this country can have faith in politics?</P>

Nothing has hap<Col N="1365" /> pened in the interim. It makes a mockery of the debate that is necessary on human rights and of the impending human rights legislation, to leave on the Order Paper a motion marked &ldquo;resumed&rdquo; which declares the duration of Human Rights Year from 10 December 1997 to 10 December 1998. It speaks of the Government that Eilís Ní Dhomhnaill, Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha, could not draft a motion to replace one that is four years old.

Several weeks ago the Taoiseach gave an undertaking to speak to those responsible and have the motion withdrawn and replaced with a more up to date motion. If a proper motion is tabled, we will be able to consider not only the legislation to which the Taoiseach refers but also the other Bills which are outstanding and which stand as a mark against us, particularly as we were supposed to have celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration in 1998.

We do not wish to be in conflict with you, Sir, but we do not understand your ruling and we do not understand the arbitrary time frame within which you exercise your prerogative as Chair.

      <P>It was not ever the norm for the Chair to quote Standing Orders. However, in this instance I do so because there seems to be a misunderstanding among Members. Standing Order 26(3) is quite clear. It states &ldquo;. . . the Ceann Comhairle may permit, at his or her discretion, questions . . .&rdquo;. The Ceann Comhairle has complete discretion in the number of questions allowed, who to call and over the duration of the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I gave Members, including Deputy Rabbitte, an opportunity to raise matters, which Deputy Rabbitte did early in the proceedings. A number of questions raised in the latter part were not in order.</P>

The Government is now in its fourth year and there is more legislation waiting for consideration than one might have expected at the start of a Dáil session. There is an enormous array of additional questions which have legitimate cause to be answered through Standing Orders and on the Order of Business. In view of this, I formally and respectfully ask you to table Standing Order 21, which you have cited, for review and discussion by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to enable us to be in order and to enable you to do the job to which you have been elected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 20, after &ldquo;Mental Health&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(Involuntary Admission)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should clarify both what this Bill is about and what its limits are. There is great concern about the issue of mental health and a great need for legislative reform. On Committee Stage, the Minister acknowledged that the Bill was only one of a number that are required to reform mental health legislation. We should have clarity when it comes to defining any legislation that goes through this House. The White Paper dealt with many issues concerning the reform of legislation in this area but some of them are absent from the Bill. This Bill deals largely with those who are admitted involuntarily to institutions and with ensuring that they have certain rights and protection. It would be appropriate for the Government to deal with these issues in new legislation, rather than trying to put a spin on it as the Government is adept at doing. When one sees the title, Mental Health Bill, one would automatically presume this is major legislation dealing with the mental health area. However, many of the outstanding issues are not dealt with in the legislation, although we welcome the Bill and support it. It is perfectly normal practice to specify in the title of any Bill, what areas are being dealt with predominantly. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy McManus. Throughout the debate on Second Stage it was emphasised that this was a very limited Bill dealing with a small, though important, aspect of the whole area of mental health. A comprehensive mental health bill is required to bring mental health services not <Col N="1373" /> out of the 20th century and even out of the 19th century. Many practices in the mental health area come from a time, in the 1940s and early 1950s, when mental hospitals were known as lunatic asylums. In an historical context that is not so long ago. Many of the country's mental hospitals were constructed in the mid-1800s and some had been adapted from old workhouses. They still have that sort of atmosphere inside. I am familiar with St. Joseph's Hospital in Limerick and one certainly goes back in time when one enters such a hospital, despite the best efforts of the staff and departmental officials.</P>
      <P>Over the decades sufficient finances have not been put into such institutions. Similarly, legislation has not been updated and new facilities have not been made available. It is recognised internationally that the best approach to mental health is a community one. The first line of a patient's treatment, no matter how serious their mental illness, should be community-based, multi-disciplinary teams who can deal with those who are mentally ill. Only in a minority of cases should people be institutionalised. We still have a situation where people who are not mentally ill are in mental institutions. I refer in particular to the intellectually disabled who are not mentally ill and are not suffering from any illness but who have a condition from birth. These people do not need mental health treatment; they need assistance to cope with the circumstances arising from their mental disability. A psychiatric hospital is not the place for such people, yet up to 300 of them are still in such institutions.</P>
      <P>We need a comprehensive Bill to deal with those and many other areas of mental health. As Deputy McManus has said, in all the contacts we have had with the Department, the Bill is described as if it is comprehensive and all-inclusive but it only deals with a very small, though important, aspect of the reform needed. We should call the Bill exactly what it is &ndash; a very limited Bill dealing with involuntary admission. As such, the Title should reflect that. Deputy McManus is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because this major Bill deals with much more than the process of involuntary admission. Half the Bill is concerned with providing for the establishment of the mental health commission and the new office of inspector of mental health services. Part 5 deals with provisions regarding the registration of approved centres in which both involuntary and voluntary patients will reside, and for a system of regulation and inspection whereby standards will be maintained in those centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the mental health commission, as described in the Bill, will extend far beyond the involuntary admission process. The commission will be concerned with the interests of all patients, both voluntary and involuntary, and with ensuring that the highest standards are <Col N="1374" /> adhered to in the provision of mental health services. Accordingly, it would be doing the Bill a grave disservice to rename it the Mental Health (Involuntary Admission) Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said, quite rightly, that on Second and Committee Stages the Minister referred to other issues. He said those issues have not been forgotten about or overlooked. They are being addressed and will be addressed further in other legislation following the enactment of this Bill. This is equally true in the provisions that are being made for mental health services this year, including not only this legislation but &ndash; following up on Deputy Neville's points &ndash; the allocation of £8.25 million for community-based services for the establishment of multi-disciplinary teams and the recruitment of additional staff to strengthen existing services. Some £1.75 million is being made available to enhance the level of psychiatric services available in hospitals. I have a personal interest in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry and I know Deputy Neville has an interest in the suicide prevention programme. Much investment is going into those areas.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides funding for community facilities, including mental health centres, day hospitals and community residences to accelerate the phasing out of the old institutions to which Deputies referred. I hope Deputies will accept that this legislation is just one element of ongoing reform of the entire mental health services. To accept the amendment, however, would give far too narrow a title to a Bill which is much more broad reaching in these respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not choosing to define the Bill more clearly because she has referred to many other areas which are not addressed in the Bill, as well as the areas that are. I am rather concerned at her sanguine approach to child psychiatric services, since she has raised the issue. There are serious concerns among professionals in this field about the failure to deliver good quality care evenly across communities in which there are children who are in desperate need of psychiatric or psychological services. Proposals have been forwarded and work has been done in providing the Government with information but the response is not always adequate.</P>
      <P>I caution the Minister of State regarding complacency about what is happening in child psychiatry and the significant lacuna that exists within that service at a time that psychiatric needs among children and young people are increasing rather than reducing because of changes in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister of State has not seen fit to clarify the Title. I agree psychiatric and psychological services for children and young people are extremely limited. Up to recent decades it was not recognised as an issue but now we realise it is a major problem. The level of coun<Col N="1375" /> selling and advice available to young people in crisis is non-existent. Teachers experience great difficulties in schools regarding how to deal with pupils in crisis. There are sophisticated systems in other countries but the service is non-existent in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Psychiatric services have improved but I refer to one instance. A special ward was introduced in Limerick Regional Hospital for psychiatric patients, ward 5B. The intention was that it would be an open ward and the doors would not be locked as was the case in the old institutions such as St. Joseph's Hospital. However, every time I visit the ward the door is locked. One must ring a bell before being allowed in, sometimes through a side door. The reason for establishing the ward was to get us away from the lock up scenario where patients felt they were confined, but that still continues in this relatively new facility which has been in place for more than 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in no way complacent about the services needed in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry. We recognise there is such a need and I recently accepted the first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, referred to by Deputy McManus, which identifies what is needed throughout the State. Under the development plan five units are proposed, of which three are already in the planning stages, and funding has been put in place. There is a huge need and progress needs to be made. Investment must also be made, but these units are one of the other elements of this issue which is being dealt with separate from the legislation. I reiterate the legislation addresses much more than involuntary admission, which is why I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 10, after &ldquo;opposite sex&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for a continuous period of not less than 3 years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment relates to the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and the need for certain safeguards to ensure the power of a spouse to apply for involuntary admission in respect of his or her partner would not be abused. It results from concerns raised by Deputies Gay Mitchell and Neville on Committee Stage. Deputy Neville raised the issue of how long a couple had to be cohabiting before a person could be defined as a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;. This amendment defines that time as &ldquo;a continuous <Col N="1376" /> period of not less than 3 years&rdquo;. I am happy to clarify the issue and I thank Deputies Mitchell and Neville for raising it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the partial response of the Minister of State in providing a definition of the length of time required to recognise cohabitation. It is difficult to define as I suspect many marriages do not last three years nowadays. However, I raised a separate issue about which I am concerned partially because I am aware of one case which I raised on Committee Stage but which has not been addressed. A cohabiting couple who are of the same sex and who may have had a long-standing relationship, which is perfectly legal, are not recognised in the legislation.</P>
      <P>There has been enormous media coverage of issues relating to high profile people who are separated and cohabiting with a new partner. There has been a national discussion about these issues and how they can be addressed. The discussion began because of the official event that took place to honour Cardinal Connell but other issues were raised regarding us coming to terms in a civilised way with the many different types of relationship which must be recognised.</P>
      <P>The Bill in part recognises that cohabiting couples are a reality of modern Irish life, but cohabiting couples of the same sex are also part of that and they have not been recognised. I am aware, for example, of such a couple. One partner was involuntarily committed and the other had absolutely no rights. She had cared for this person, understood this person best and had been a loyal and dedicated partner in a close and intimate way for many years, yet when this couple faced a crisis she had absolutely no say, involvement or established right to be consulted or have any part to play in this distressing experience.</P>
      <P>This issue must be addressed. Either we say cohabiting couples do not exist or we recognise them. The recent media debate demonstrates that the public recognises the difficulties involved. My party leader, Deputy Quinn, made the point that at some stage in the future we may well have a gay or lesbian Taoiseach. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility. Will we ensure there is protocol and procedures to allow for that eventuality? Can it be dealt with in a way that is accommodating and inclusive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue on Committee Stage and it does not require a specific example. What is required is recognition that there are circumstances where couples live together who are of the same sex. It is estimated that one in 20 men is a homosexual but I do not know whether that is true. It is a feature of Irish life, which is similar to other countries, but it is not recognised in the Bill. We are saying we will recognise couples who have co-habited for more than three years. They can <Col N="1377" /> obviously be married, which is well and good, but if someone is in this other kind of relationship, which may be a loving and long-standing one, we are saying we will not include them in the frame.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to outline the Government view on this issue? She has had time to reflect on it and the civil servants have had a chance to look at it but it is very specific in the Bill that it is a person only of the opposite sex, and yet these relationships exist and are being sustained. Any form of discrimination is now considered to be unacceptable. Is this a form of discrimination? Does it discriminate? We have an Equal Status Act which requires people who traditionally were happy to discriminate for all sorts of reasons to change their practices, even though they may believe they are justified in trying to protect their interests by not doing so. They are required by law to do so but there is no requirement now for anybody within the mental health services to acknowledge a relationship of this type, certainly not in the way it is specified in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McManus will accept that while recognising the changing face of Irish society, perhaps the debate on the Mental Health Bill is not the place to start defining different groups and relationships. What is important to recognise is that even though the spouse is one of the specific people mentioned in section 8(1), it is with regard to making an application for involuntary admission. There is also a subsection (<i>d</i>) which says &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;, so perhaps those people can be included under that heading and not excluded from the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether there is discrimination, under the Bill same sex couples are not treated any less favourably than heterosexual couples so there is no discrimination one against the other. The only distinction that is made is for the spouse but this is not the place to start defining issues like that, save to say that anybody who is covered by section 8 can make the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to come back to the Minister on this because the Bill is where this issue has been raised. It has not been raised by the Opposition. There is a definition in the Bill of a spouse, which means a husband or wife, the traditional, unambiguous definition of a spouse. It is the Minister who has defined and extended that definition. It did not come from this side of the House. It has gone beyond marriage into the area of cohabitation. It is a practical recognition that couples do not all take the form of the married couple and that there are other family formations now and close partnerships and relationships. That argument is over. We have moved beyond that so the discussion now is about the way we define cohabitation so that it accurately reflects what is happening in our society. To simply bunch these people in under the heading &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is discriminating against them in that if they are of the opposite sex, they have the status of <Col N="1378" /> spouse but if they are of the same sex they are simply &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;. That is what happened in an individual case where somebody was treated as &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If I had a clear answer to this problem I would have put down an amendment but I raise it because it is a real issue affecting a certain number of people in our community. We are providing legislation for all our citizens and all our citizens are required to comply with it. The Minister of State glibly said we should not discuss this matter under a mental health Bill. If that is the case, it should not be in the Mental Health Bill because once the definition of a spouse is in the Bill, it is appropriate for us to discuss the different kind of relationships that exist. If we do not do that, we are simply being selective and discriminatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) This Act shall, in so far as it is practicable, apply to persons detained in prison at the discretion of the Commission and the Inspector of mental health services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased we are having a discussion on the mental health of prisoners with a Minister of State from the Department of Health and Children rather than someone from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as is usually the case when we discuss the health of prisoners. It is a criminal justice issue in this House rather than a health issue so I am pleased that we will get a response from the Department of Health and Children on the health of prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people detained in prison who should not be in prison. They should have access to mental health services. It is difficult to quantify but John Lonergan, the Governor of Mountjoy, has stated that up to 50% of prisoners in his care should be under the mental health services. These people are in prison for many reasons. They may have had a disorder at a young age, they may have had difficulties at school or they may have difficulties like attention deficit disorder and have now found themselves in prison because of habitual criminal acts resulting from a mental difficulty. John Lonergan said that up to 40% of prisoners in Mountjoy suffered as children and continue to suffer attention deficit disorder and they should have been treated at that time but the condition was not recognised then. It is only in the past five years that there has been any recognition of the presence of attention deficit disorder. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is now recognised as a condition but many psy<Col N="1379" /> chiatrists still deny its existence and refuse to treat it. It is recognised that many people with attention deficit disorder end up in prison because of their dysfunction.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric services available in prisons is not sufficient to meet the needs of prisoners. It would be beneficial, at the discretion of the commission and the inspector of mental health services, if sections of the Bill applied to persons who have been in prisons and who have a form of mental disorder or a psychiatric condition. Accordingly, I would like to see the inspector of mental health services and the commission given a role in quantifying the extent of mental difficulties among the prison population and in making recommendations on how to meet the needs of people in prison who have a mental illness.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some role for the inspector of mental services in trying to ensure that the best interests of prisoners who suffer from a mental disorder or breakdown or who are suicidal are treated so that they are given the maximum opportunity to recover. Most of these people did not get any opportunity before they became part of the prison population. If they had, they would not have become recidivists who repeatedly re-offend. We did not invest resources in people like that who had difficulties at a young age and who are now recidivists. Some of them are institutionalised. If somebody commits a crime to return to prison, because that is the only place to which they can turn, that person is suffering from a condition that should be treated rather than punished.</P>
    <P>The level of suicide among prisoners is higher than ever. Prisoners suffer from overcrowding, drug abuse and psychiatric problems, for which they receive little or no treatment. They are in a threatening system as prisons are difficult places in which to survive if one has a disorder or if one is depressed.</P>
    <P>Dr. Enda Dooley, director of prison medical services, said the problem faced by people trying to improve conditions is that the general public does not want to know and, therefore, there is no pressure on politicians to deal with the severe health difficulties in prisons. We are all human and we respond to public needs. That is part of democracy. However, there are occasions on which we must decide that, even though the public is not interested, it is a human right that prisoners receive the same level of physical and mental treatment as the general public. We are denying prisoners that human right.</P>
    <P>The only occasion on which there is an interest in prison suicide is when one occurs. An 18 year old sent to prison for the first time could have a history of violence or drug abuse and can feel frightened. He or she may receive a sentence of six or 12 months and be placed with a hardened drug user or a violent prisoner. Instead of perhaps completing the leaving certificate and entering third level that young person is put in <Col N="1380" /> prison with hardened drug abusers who will exercise mental control over him or her.</P>
    <P>That young person may suffer from a disorder such as attention deficit disorder, yet he or she is placed in an environment in which his or her senses are deprived, despite the fact that someone with ADD requires constant stimulus. What hope is there of reforming such a person so that he or she can live a full and productive life on leaving prison?</P>
    <P>Ireland has the second lowest crime rate yet the highest rate of prison suicide. Dr. Dooley pointed out that there are the equivalent of two full-time psychiatrists in the prison service for more than 2,600 prisoners. A report published by the European CPT commission recommended that in-patient psychiatric services for prisoners be reorganised as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated towards the end of last year that improvements would take place in prison psychiatric services. However, we have heard no more about this. My information is that there are still only two full-time psychiatrists. I would welcome an update from the Minister on any improvements which have taken place since he announced that he would do something about this issue.</P>
    <P>Fr. Fergal McDonagh, head of the prison chaplaincy service, stated that a prisoner might be lucky to see a psychiatrist for five minutes at the most. Unfortunately the psychiatric system's main function is to dispense prescribed medication, such as sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. Counselling is non-existent in the prison service.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year Fr. McDonagh also stated regarding suicide in prison, that if a person says he or she is depressed or suicidal, the response within the prison system is that he or she is stripped to his or her underwear, is taken to a room six feet by five feet which is padded, or sometimes unpadded. The room will have a plastic mattress on the floor and a blanket designed so it cannot be torn and used as a ligature. The person is left in the room and has to eat meals off the floor. Some people might only spend one day in the room, yet some have spent weeks in such sensory deprivation. Fr. McDonagh pointed out that this would not happen in a psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>Surely the mental health services should supervise this treatment. The inspector should be able to express a view on this situation. A person who is suicidal or deeply depressed should not be prison. If a prisoner breaks a leg, he or she is immediately taken to a general hospital under guard. Such people receive treatment and the service ensures that they recover fully. However, if a person has a mental breakdown and is suicidal, he or she is put into a padded cell. Surely a person who is deeply depressed is as ill as someone who has broken a leg.</P>
    <P>There is no impediment to admitting a prisoner to a psychiatric facility. However, such prisoners <Col N="1381" /> are not admitted to hospital, unlike prisoners in need of surgical or medical care. The prison system has not insisted that prisoners can only go to one secure hospital, namely, the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum. Most prisoners do not present a security risk to the public and have no intention of escaping. There is no reason they cannot be admitted to the local psychiatric facility or hospital. Many prisoners will be well-known to such services. Many prisoners who are very depressed do not threaten anyone as they are inward-looking, silent, meek and ill. However, we do not admit such people to psychiatric hospitals, even though they do not present any threat.</P>
    <P>Health authorities are reluctant to take responsibility for mental health care in prisons. This amendment moves in the direction of identifying and recognising the mental health aspect of many prisoners. Only 1.5% of the prison budget is spent on health care &ndash; the lowest percentage in Europe. At the same time, the Government spends almost £900 per week to keep a prisoner in custody. The Irish Penal Reform Trust argues that some of this money should be re-routed into alternative custody methods, such as restorative justice programmes. Dr. Charles Smith, medical director of the Central Mental Hospital, has stated that there is no chance of rehabilitating or treating a person in prison, as there is too much negativity in such institutions.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that the health services recognise that there is a health issue in prisons, and that they should have some input and report to the Department of Health and Children, not the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The latter Department has responsibility for keeping people in custody and ensuring that those who commit crimes pay their dues to society. That is not at issue. People must pay their dues to society, but there is a problem regarding people who are seriously ill, who are not being treated but are, and have been, ignored for generations.</P>
    <P>We could significantly reduce the prison population by identifying early mental disorders and difficulties, such as attention deficit disorder. Families which are not dysfunctional have children who suffer from ADD. These families experience difficulties with these children in childhood and youth, and these children are now in prison. I am aware of one case in which a person suffering from ADD was being treated in prison with ritalin. Two elderly psychiatrists examined this prisoner and decided to take him off this drug as it is addictive. While on ritalin the young man was talking about leaving prison and sitting his leaving certificate examination. However, the next time his father visited him after he was taken off ritalin his condition had deteriorated. This is what is happening in the prison service. We must recognise this fact and this amendment would enable us to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasonable, worthwhile amendment which would not create practi<Col N="1382" /> cal difficulties. I would be concerned that the main block to dealing with the whole issue of health care in prisons is a turf war between two Departments. I hope that is not the case. However, there tends to be great difficulties in transferring responsibilities between Departments, perhaps because one Department might feel it is losing face. However, in this instance it makes no sense that the health service for prisoners is run by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform when the Department of Health and Children is responsible for the health of the people. Either prisoners are part of our population or they are not. Everybody recognises that they are and, as such, their health needs should be no different from the health needs of others and should be dealt with by the appropriate Department. That would be logical and would be helpful in progressing the health care of prisoners, both physical and psychiatric.</P>
      <P>The history of such care has been appalling. Best medical practice demands that people living in institutions should have a higher level of health care than those outside. I am not simply referring to prisons but to other institutions where there is a continual problem, particularly in physical terms, of infections and other conditions being easily transferred among people. Other factors also impact on health status. In Britain, the medical view is that people living in institutions should be able to enjoy a better standard of health care than those outside. However, that is not being put forward in this amendment. The amendment proposes that people in prison who have psychiatric disorders should not be dealt with any worse than people outside. The standards should be equivalent and there should be the same protections. Unfortunately, the Minister's response to this proposal by Deputy Neville on Committee Stage was not positive. Disappointingly, he said it was being put back to the review that was established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and on which the Department of Health and Children was represented. Even in that case it was not seen as a shared responsibility, let alone that it should become the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Most prisoners are young, male and poor. Many prisoners, certainly a higher proportion than in the general population, suffer from psychiatric illness to some degree. The suicide level is alarmingly high, particularly given that it is not a huge prison population in terms of the ratio of prisoners to prison warders. We have a high number of prison guards. However, we have too many people in prison compared to other countries in the context of possible alternative penalties and forms of punishment. The concept of having other forms of punishment is becoming more popular but it is a slow process. In the meantime, there are many young people incarcerated in prison who are definitely and clearly at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who visits Mountjoy Prison does not leave there feeling anything but great shame at <Col N="1383" /> the fact that we tolerate such treatment of prisoners and, to an extent, the people employed to care for them. The amendment seeks to include these people, in so far as it is practicable, within the oversight role of the commission and the inspectorate. Recently, the general population heard a debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; about the forms of confinement that are still used in our prisons, following publication of the report by the prison reform group. Many people were probably astonished when the methods of confinement were described. People are not particularly interested in what happens to prisoners until it is brought home to them that there is such an archaic approach to dealing with people who are often extremely distressed, ill and in need of the benefits of advances in medical care which the rest of the population has but which they are clearly unable to access.</P>
    <P>There is a benefit to society if we can deal with these issues. It would at least ensure the level of crime would be stabilised and possibly reduced because we would see both the crime and the person who commits the crime in a holistic way and in a way in which we can understand and differentiate between the different purposes, motives and outcomes of individual prisoners. The Minister referred to a review on Committee Stage. Will the Minister tell us about the review and the outcome in terms of the changes that can be expected? Why should such a review block this amendment? I read the Minister's statement again to see why there should be a conflict but I still cannot see it.</P>
    <P>These are psychiatrically ill people who are part of the prison population. Studies show that there is a higher incidence of psychiatric illness among prisoners than in the general community. There is no argument about that. Why can that cohort of psychiatrically ill people not simply be included in the work of the commission so there is rationality and so they can enjoy certain safeguards? They are still human beings, regardless of whether they are incarcerated, and when they have a psychiatric illness they are sick people who could benefit enormously from the medical and therapeutic improvements that are occurring. People who suffer from schizophrenia, for example, have benefited enormously from the advances resulting from innovation and technological advances. It is important that we reach out to psychiatrically ill people, regardless of where they are, if we are serious about reforming mental health legislation.</P>

      <P>While I do not accept the amendment, I agree with many of the views expressed with regard to the need for substantial improvement in the psychiatric services currently provided for the prison population. I support the principle that the health services in prisons should at least be on a par with those available to the rest of the community. I assure the Deputies that <Col N="1384" /> the Department of Health and Children is actively taking steps in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Department is represented on the review group on the structure and organisation of prison health care services. The review will cover all aspects of health care, not just psychiatric services. The group was set up in November 1999 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine a number of issues, including the report of the Irish Penal Reform Trust on the treatment of prisoners with mental illness, the use of padded cells and so forth. It is also examining the need for a reorganisation of psychiatric services for prisoners and the provision of a properly structured forensic psychiatric service. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is also represented on the group.</P>
      <P>This group is addressing many of the issues which have been raised today. It has visited every Irish prison and prisons outside the jurisdiction to consider best practice in the organisation of prison health care. The report is nearing completion. I hope that, perhaps taking the model of the drug treatment service, the work can be done through a partnership between the statutory and voluntary agencies, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville spoke about the need to quantify the extent of mental disorder among the prison population. The problem in verifying the real needs in this area stems, to a large extent, from a lack of consultant forensic psychiatrist input into the prisons. One of the objectives of the Department of Health and Children has been to address that. The Deputy asked what progress had been made. Since 1999, funding for five additional consultant forensic psychiatric teams has been provided. One of these has been appointed to the Central Mental Hospital and is now working in Mountjoy and Cloverhill Prisons. Two further posts in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area have been advertised to be filled this year. The remainder of one each in Limerick and Cork will be progressed later this year. In addition, the Department has been involved in discussions with the Prison Service and the Midland Health Board on the development of health services for the new midlands prison. It is hoped that the services developed there will serve as a model of best practice for other prisons in the State.</P>
      <P>The concept of partnership and the admission of prisoners to local psychiatric hospitals are also being addressed. Discussions to this end have commenced in the midlands between the prisons and the health board. While I recognise that much remains to be done, we have made a start in this area with a view to addressing the problems of prison health care. I assure Deputies that the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are working closely on this issue to see what progress can be made. Action will be taken as soon as the review group issues its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The real reason this amendment is not being accepted is that the role of the Inspector of Mental Health Services is not appropriate to an inspection of prison facilities. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is preparing proposals to establish an inspector of prisons in the context of a prisons Bill. The measures being taken to improve prison psychiatric services will go some way towards addressing the current problems and I hope Deputies will accept that this amendment would not enhance that work in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed that the Minister does not believe the Department of Health and Children should have a direct role in the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners. She stated that such services would more properly be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under an inspector of prisons and that acceptance of this amendment would cut across that Department's proposal to establish the post of an inspector of prisons. This is the very issue we wish to address. Health issues in prisons should be the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children, not the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is the core of this amendment. An inspector of prisons would have a broad remit ranging from the type of food available to the provision of educational services etc. We want to hone in on mental health issues.</P>
      <P>The Governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, who has been repeatedly praised for his humane attitude to prisoners, has stated that up to 40% of prisoners suffer from attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The implication is that if these disorders had been treated in time, these people would not be in prison. Prison is a depressing place; prisoners suffer from endogenous and exogenous depression and they require treatment for these conditions in the same way as they would require treatment for a broken leg. I am disappointed the Minister has not grasped this opportunity for the Department of Health and Children to become involved in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply highlighted the real problem; while the Department of Health and Children is participating in the review, it does not have any decision making powers. The review process may result in the production of a magnificent report which will merely gather dust on a shelf. No dedicated health care budget was provided in the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which does not, under normal circumstances, deal with health care issues. An inspector of prisons might not have any knowledge of psychiatric illness and although he or she might do a good inspection job, it is unlikely he or she would have the expertise to assess prisoners' health needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has trudged along for years in an effort to upgrade and <Col N="1386" /> improve services and has acquitted himself very well in terms of highlighting the needs of psychiatric patients. The inspector has knowledge in this area and has had the daily experience of dealing with a poor quality service for very vulnerable people. At this stage, he could look back and say that some improvements have been made.</P>
    <P>Although I recognise the difficulties involved in appointing consultants within a reasonable time frame, the fact that only one of five consultant psychiatrists has been appointed at this stage is not very hopeful. If the Minister is sympathetic to these problems &ndash; and I do not have any reason to doubt her &ndash; she must recognise the logic of our proposal. Let us include prisoners in the provision of psychiatric services and ensure that safeguards and protections are provided for them in this Bill. Otherwise, the legislation will be flawed and the population it is intended to support and protect will not include prisoners. That would be most regressive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication of the Deputies' comments is that health services are not being provided in prisons. Psychiatric services are provided by the ERHA in the Dublin prisons via psychiatrists from the Central Mental Hospital. It is unfortunate that in spite of funding having been made available, only one consultancy team has been appointed to date. Hopefully, the remaining four will be in place by the end of the year. The practicalities of service provision are being catered for at present. In spite of the fact that responsibility for prisons rests with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, services are being provided on a partnership basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Prison psychiatric services are totally inadequate; in some cases they are almost non-existent. The Minister implied that the psychiatric services provided at present are almost adequate. Let me again quote from comments made by Fr. Fergal McDonagh, head of prison chaplaincy services, during a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme in January of this year. In regard to prisoners with psychiatric conditions he stated:</P>
      <P>A prisoner is lucky to see a psychiatrist. A prisoner would be very lucky to see a psychiatrist for five minutes and that would be stretching it. Unfortunately, the psychiatric system we have is essentially one whose main function is to dispense or prescribe medication, sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. Counselling is non-existent in the prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a big play about the review group on health care. We debated the number of review groups yesterday with her senior Minister. My amendment proposes that the commission and mental health services inspector should be involved in inspecting prison psychiatric services. Their report would be of enormous benefit to the review group the Minister mentioned. If the amendment was accepted and the inspector of <Col N="1387" /> mental hospitals could visit prisons and the commission could examine psychiatric services in prisons solely from a mental health perspective, their views and reports would be of enormous assistance to the review group set up in November 1999. This opportunity should be used to ensure the views of the commission that will be established and the inspector of mental hospitals are available.</P>
    <P>There was a discussion yesterday involving Deputy Gay Mitchell about the number of review groups in the Department of Health and Children. Such groups are cited by officials in the Department and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, at every opportunity. It is the first time I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, refer to a review group, but the answer of the Minister, Deputy Martin, to every question is that a review group or committee is examining the matter. The Minister of State used the ploy that a review group is dealing with this issue, but that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister of State cannot accept a situation where the health boards supervise a psychiatric service that puts a suicidal person, whom the prison authorities consider might die by suicide, into a cell measuring four feet by five feet and strips him or her down to his or her underclothes. The person is placed on a plastic mattress and he or she must eat off the floor. Such people experience total sensory deprivation for long periods. I cannot accept that this service, which is supervised by the health boards, is adequate. It deprives people of their human dignity and rights. The amendment would enable a person in authority, who has experience and psychiatric training, to point out what is wrong and the changes that are needed. The Prisons Service favours such a development. Prison governors or those who work in prisons are not happy taking an ill person, who is in danger of dying by suicide, and placing him or her in a padded cell where he or she is stripped to his or her underclothes and given a plastic mattress. The person must eat off the floor because nothing that could pose a danger to him or her can be put into the cell. These people should be treated in hospital.</P>
    <P>The amendment would begin a process where such procedures are questioned by those who know what they are talking about. My belief is that the Minister of State finds it difficult not to accept the amendment. Given her experience and humanity, she must have some sympathy for and understanding of our effort to ensure an input from the psychiatric services, the commission and the proposed development of the system involving the inspector of mental hospitals. They should have an input to cases involving people who are in deep crises and deeply depressed. Such people may be suffering from schizophrenia or other mental disorders. They may be incarcerated in <Col N="1388" /> prisons and in need of psychiatric help. However, as we were informed, they can only get a tablet that will put them to sleep or see a psychiatrist for five minutes at most. This is no way to treat people who are seriously ill.</P>
    <P>The governor of the Central Mental Hospital expressed his concerns about the fact that if somebody is in need of treatment and hospitalisation but there is no bed for him or her in Dundrum, he or she remains in prison. The facilities in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum are limited in terms of dealing with people in prison who are mentally ill. If a prison doctor refers a person to the hospital but no beds are available, he or she remains in prison and is treated there.</P>
    <P>If the commission has the authority to consider the treatment of people in prison with mental health conditions, surely the Minister of State would be happy if the inspector of mental hospitals could visit the prisons and examined the treatment provided there. Surely she would be happy that such reports would prod, coax and induce the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accept the dire nature of the situation rather than set up a broad based inspectorate that will examine prison food, the rehabilitation and education of prisoners, prison clothing, prison exercise arrangements and even television hours and the psychiatric services. There should be a dedicated approach because of the unique relationship between psychiatric disorders, including personality disorders and mental illnesses, and those who commit crime and are imprisoned, particularly recidivists.</P>
    <P>A person who continually returns to prison because he or she is institutionalised needs special attention. There is obviously a problem in that regard because who would want to spend his or her life in prison? However, some people are comfortable with spending their lives in prison and they need help, not incarceration. We fully accept the right of society to ensure that those who commit crimes pay their dues and that society is protected from crime by measures that include a level of incarceration. We have always supported that position and encouraged its extension. However, the other side of the coin is the direct relationship between psychiatric illness and the prison population which is not being addressed. It has never been dealt with and the amendment provides an opportunity for the psychiatric services to have a key influence in this area. I urge the Minister of State to change her mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the services are adequate. However, where they exist, they are provided by the health service and not by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My opening remarks were that substantial improvement is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>3.&ndash;(1) In every decision, whether under this Act or otherwise, concerning a person to whom this Act applies or may be applied as a patient, the best interests of that person shall be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who has been or is liable to be affected by a decision under this Act shall have the right, so far as is reasonably practicable, to prior and informed consultation and to have his or her views given due regard.</P>
      <P>(3) Subject to the extent&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a) necessary for the provision of care and treatment, and</P>
      <P>(b) authorised by this Act,</P>
      <P>a patient who has been involuntarily admitted and detained, or to whom treatment not requiring consent has been administered, retains his or her rights to dignity, bodily integrity, privacy and autonomy; every decision concerning the provision of such care and treatment shall have regard to the need to respect those rights.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 7 in the name of the Minister, which essentially deals with this issue by the inclusion of the phrase, &ldquo;with due regard being given to the interests of other persons who may be at risk.&rdquo;  That is a reasonable addition to what is a setting out of fundamental principles to be adhered to within the legislation. It was important that I tabled the amendment and the Minister, in a very welcome move, took on the need to provide this set of principles to protect the individual. The idea of what is in the best interests of the individual is now being enshrined in the Bill, which will be welcomed by many in the community. They have been concerned about the area of mental health, looked at our history of treatment and failure to treat those suffering from psychiatric illness in a way that is dignified and respectful of their needs. There has been much abuse of vulnerable persons in institutions, be they the psychiatrically ill, children or women with crisis pregnancies.</P>
      <P>It is important the way the legislation is framed recognises the individual's right to integrity, dignity, privacy and autonomy. These are the features of the amendment being brought forward by the Minister. They are fundamental and important principles which make this better legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment and the acceptance by the Minister of the proposal from <Col N="1391" /><Col N="1392" /> Deputy McManus. The amendment is very important in that the history of treatment in the mental services has been one where the patient has almost been depersonalised. They were seen not to have a point of view and to be incapable of having one. They did not have the right to privacy, dignity, personal autonomy or question their treatment. We have seen, and unfortunately to an extent still see, people who have been in mental institutions for ten, 20, 30, 40 and even 50 years, who in today's more enlightened climate would never have seen the inside of those institutions. Many of their problems were social rather than ones of mental health and though what has passed has passed, we must ensure a total change from that approach. We must ensure we change the approach where the person who is mentally ill becomes the third party to any decisions taken about his or her treatment and confinement and his or her personal views are totally ignored.</P>
      <P>I have received statements from people who have been involved in mental institutions over the years. I would like to know how clinical trials were conducted prior to the involvement of the board which granted permission to do so. When I say that people have mentioned the clinical trials which took place in some mental institutions in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and perhaps in the 1970s where the person's dignity, bodily integrity, privacy and autonomy may have been ignored, I am asked to give examples. However, I do not have examples. People have asked me to examine that situation. I will return to this point on another amendment. I welcome the fact that this will give to people who suffer from a psychiatric illness the same status and dignity that is given to those who suffer from a physical illness. There is a charter of patients' rights for those who attend general hospitals. There should also be a charter of rights for people confined to a mental institution.</P>
      <P>The interests of the person shall be the principal consideration. I have met people who were extremely concerned about a member of their family who was suicidal but who was discharged from a mental institution. They were extremely distressed because they were afraid the person would commit suicide. In one case a father and daughter came to me about their son and brother who was discharged from a mental institution but who was still suicidal. I spoke to the hospital authorities. However, six months later I met someone who told me he had been found hanged that morning. I am extremely concerned about discharging people who are suicidal. The best interests of a person who is suicidal in a mental institution or who is receiving mental treatment will only be served if we ensure their survival. We should have proper systems in place and we should not adopt the attitude that nothing more can be done for them even if they are suicidal. That attitude prevails, although I am not saying every psychiatrist is of that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are too many cases of people whose families are concerned about suicide ideation and <Col N="1393" /> who end up committing suicide. A family's concerns are often ignored because a psychiatrist will say his or her relationship is with the patient and no one else should express a view. He or she will not discuss the patient's condition. If a person suffers from a serious mental illness and his or her family is concerned about suicide ideation and the psychiatrist decides to remain silent because of the patient doctor relationship, those concerns should be taken into account. One case is too many. The risk of suicide is 400 times greater for someone in the first four weeks after being discharged from a psychiatric institution.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good idea to have a general statement of principles at the beginning of the Bill. This issue was raised by Deputy McManus on Committee Stage and there is already a precedent for it in the Child Care Act. These principles are important. The Minister's amendment differs in some detail from the amendment tabled by Deputy McManus but the general principles are the same. One important change is that while the text acknowledges that the best interests of the person should be the principal consideration when taking decisions about involuntary detention, it also stresses the need to be careful that the interests of other persons, such as family, friends or staff who may be at risk of serious harm, are taken into account. The wording of subsection (2) has also been changed but the principles of the prior consent of the patient and his or her views being given due regard are still intact. I thank Deputy McManus for raising this concept on Committee Stage and for acknowledging that the Minister's amendment follows the spirit of her amendment. Perhaps she will withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 3, after &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and which seriously impairs the mental function of the person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to re-examine the definition of mental illness in section 3. A form of words taken from the New South Wales Act, 1990, had been proposed. However, on closer examination and following detailed consultations with medical experts, it was found that the New South Wales definition was over-prescriptive and could broaden the grounds on which a person could be involuntarily detained. The amendment now proposed by the Minister incorporates into the existing definition a key phrase from the New South Wales Act. In the revised version, the person's mental function must be seriously impaired to the extent that he or she requires treatment. Taken <Col N="1394" /> together with the definition of mental disorder in subsection (1) of this section, this amendment will ensure that a stringent test of mental incapacity will apply for those who are being involuntarily detained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that. The Bill states: &ldquo;a state of mind of a person which affects ... to the extent that he or she requires care or medical treatment&rdquo;. The amendment states: &ldquo;which seriously impairs the mental function of the person&rdquo;. That is different from what the Minister of State referred to, which is already in the Bill.</P>

It strengthens the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;(1) In making a decision under this Act concerning the care or treatment of a person (including a decision to make an admission order in relation to a person), the best interests of the person shall be the principal consideration with due regard being given to the interests of the other persons who may be at risk of serious harm if the decision is not made.</P>
      <P>(2) Where it is proposed to make a recommendation or an admission order in respect of a person, or to administer treatment to a person under this Act, the person shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be notified of the proposal and be entitled to make representations in relation to it and before deciding the matter due consideration shall be given to any representations duly made under this subsection.</P>
      <P>(3) In making a decision under this Act concerning the care or treatment of a person (including a decision to make an admission order in relation to a person) due regard shall be given to the need to respect the right of the person to dignity, bodily integrity, privacy and autonomy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> In page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The commission shall, within 6 months of its appointment, publish comprehensive guidelines and definitions on what constitutes &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; or &ldquo;social deviance&rdquo; as described in this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsection (7)(ii) states that nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed as authorising the involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre by reason of the fact that the person is suffering from a personality disorder, is socially deviant or is acting through drugs or intoxication. The Bill does not interpret these terms. What qualifies as social deviance? How is personality disorder identified? The amendment proposes that the commission publish comprehensive guidelines setting out what constitutes personality disorder or social deviance.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;social deviant&rdquo; has changed over the years. Many seen as deviants at different times in our history would not now be seen as deviants. Consenting homosexuals have been seen as deviants but we have advanced from times such as those. The terms are not defined. In the Middle Ages people were burned at the stake for homosexuality.</P>
    <P>Social deviancy can differ between groups. For example, there is currently a debate in Ireland about Romany gypsies and their customs. Ireland is moving towards a multi-racial society. Other groups are entering the country with their own customs and norms which may to another group be seen as deviant. There are justifiable concerns about the Romany population in Ireland but that group does not consider itself to be socially deviant. Those from different social backgrounds may perceive others to be socially deviant when they are not. Particular behaviour may be acceptable and the norm within their class.</P>
    <P>As we move to a multi-racial society, who is to decide what is socially deviant? Diverse groups will contribute to life in Ireland and it is important that we have a clearly defined interpretation in this section of the Bill. Social deviancy and personality disorder are contentious in their definition even among experts in the area. There is still a debate about attention deficit disorder. It is a recognised medical condition, but there are still psychiatrists who say it does not exist. Some claim that bad parenting causes the difficulties. Parents suffered extreme difficulty and guilt because they believed they were doing something wrong with a difficult child, even though they had no difficulties with their other children. These concepts change over time, thankfully. The previous Minister has accepted that condition exists.</P>
    <P>We need a clear definition of what &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;social deviance&rdquo; mean. A close examination should be made and the Bill should cater for this.</P>
    <Col N="1396" />
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important issue raised by Deputy Neville in this amendment. The terms &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;social deviance&rdquo; are used in the Bill on the grounds that nothing shall be construed as authorising the involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre by reason only of the fact that the person is suffering from a personality disorder or is socially deviant. That is an argument for not committing a person but it is not clear what ground the terms cover. It will be difficult in a legal context to argue about these terms when they are not defined in the Bill. It is a genuine difficulty.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the definition of social deviance changes. That should not prevent us from defining what we mean at this time. If a change is needed in the future, that can be dealt with at an appropriate time. As a student in the 1960s, a young man was incarcerated in a mental hospital because he was Maoist. He was considered to hold views that indicated mental illness. One does not have to agree with Maoism, but it is now considered to be a political belief one could hold without ending up in a mental hospital.</P>
      <P>That example is an indication that such things can happen, and can be the subject of court action. It is important that the words and terms of a Bill are explained and defined so that all agree what they mean. Lawyers make a great deal of money and people's rights can be infringed if there is fuzziness. Deputy Neville's proposal is a practical one asking the commission to come back with a full report, having reflected on and come to a consensus on these terms. It is a difficult job but somebody needs to do it. It seems a good avenue to ensure that this issue is dealt with in a way that people can buy into.</P>
      <P>I foresee problems ahead if the issue is not dealt with. The Bill will be challenged as it is unclear what is meant. One can argue that people are socially deviant from time to time and are otherwise normal. However, one can also argue that social deviance is an expression of serious and dangerous psychiatric illness. It is important to clarify this and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he had sympathy with this proposal and that the commission will issue guidelines in relation to this matter. However, having consulted the legal experts I am advised that the amendment is outside the functions of the Mental Health Commission. A determination of whether someone suffers from a mental disorder, personality disorder or social deviance is a matter of clinical judgment best left to the medical experts handling individual decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill says that persons cannot be subject to involuntary admission by reason only of the fact that they are socially deviant etc.. Every consultant's decision made at the time a person is admitted involuntarily will be subject to a review by a tribunal, which is a further safeguard. It is not <Col N="1397" /> possible, as the Deputies indicated, to put in place a clear and concise definition of these terms. It is better that the consultant makes the decision and that the decision be subject to a review. We believe it is not within the scope of the commission to do this because its job is to promote, foster and encourage good practice in the provision of mental health services. The commission also has a particular function in relation to the protection of the interests of those who are involuntarily detained. For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met an Ulster Unionist Party delegation, including the First Minister, David Trimble, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and Leisure, Michael McGimpsey, on Friday, 4 May. Our discussions ranged over the outstanding issues on the agenda, including decommissioning, policing and the exclusion of Sinn Féin Ministers from attendance at meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council. Discussions also covered the excellent work being done on North-South co-operation, including our joint intensive efforts to contain the spread of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I also met representatives of Sinn Féin on Friday, 11 May, including the Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, the Minister for Health, Bairbre de Brún and the Minister for Education, Martin McGuinness. As well as covering the outstanding issues in the negotiations, we discussed the action taken by David Trimble in lodging a post-dated letter of resignation with the Speaker of the Assembly.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House the week before last, the Government was surprised by Mr. Trimble's statement as, when I had met Mr. Trimble on the previous Friday, there was no indication that such a course of action was under consideration.</P>
      <P>Over recent weeks and up to the calling of the British general election, officials have sought to make as much progress as possible, especially with a view to intensive negotiations involving the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties getting under way immediately after the British elections.</P>

      <P>A high profile meeting took place in Dublin Castle today between members of the Government and members of Sinn Féin who are Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive. Does the Taoiseach realise this could be construed as an interference by the Government in the election process in Northern Ireland? Will he comment on the objections made by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, to the meeting? Will he also comment on the coincidence of the meeting being arranged on the day John Hume, leader of the SDLP, meets the former United States President, Bill Clinton, in Derry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting which took place this morning was a low-key breakfast meeting which lasted 40 minutes and included four Mini<Col N="1400" /> sters, Deputies Woods and Martin and Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brún. It was followed by a separate meeting involving the Ministers for Education and Health which lasted for 30 minutes. The meetings went well. The breakfast discussion was informal and short and included a number of issues.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin again registered the difficulty it has with the ban on North-South Ministerial Council meetings in that it cannot follow through in the normal way on the agenda on which it had been working prior to those meetings running into difficulties at the end of October. That causes problems for the Sinn Féin Party. My colleagues expressed the hope that the matter would be resolved in the context of the intensive negotiations following the elections.</P>
      <P>There was little media interest in this meeting until David Trimble's protest against it broke. No formal press conference was arranged for the reason that it was to be kept low-key, although the Ministers were doorstepped as they emerged from the meeting. The line taken by all the Ministers was low-key and constructive, stressing the meeting was simply part of the ongoing process of North-South co-operation, which is what it was, and to ensure momentum was sustained. They noted the complementarity between the health services and education sectors, especially where child welfare is concerned, which was the issue discussed this morning. When asked if the meeting was meant to be in any way embarrassing to David Trimble, Martin McGuinness replied: &ldquo;Absolutely not&rdquo;. He wished David Trimble well and stressed his support for the opinion polls in the Belfast Telegraph which showed strong support for the Agreement. He also stressed his party's strong support for the Agreement.</P>
      <P>An official from the First Minister's office rang an official in my Department who gave him more or less the outline I have given. Our view is to meet any of the parties or individuals over the period of the elections but to conduct those meetings without press conferences and in a low-key fashion. I have already done that with a number of the parties and will continue to do so at their request. I do not intend to initiate any meetings.</P>

      <P>Being the consummate politician he is, the Taoiseach knows how sensitive parties can become at election time and that this is especially true in Northern Ireland, not only across the Nationalist-Unionist divide but within the Nationalist community itself where there is intense competition between Sinn Féin and the SDLP. Does the Taoiseach not realise that certain people in Northern Ireland will interpret the meeting this morning as a political act by the Government to give a high profile platform in Dublin Castle to representatives of Sinn Féin in the middle of the election? To allay any fears, will the Taoiseach state clearly when this meeting was arranged and what was the process which led to it occurring today?</P>

      <P>It was not a high profile meeting. There was little or no press interest in it and that would have remained the case if Mr. Trimble had not made his comments. I still do not consider the meeting of any great significance.</P>
      <P>I was to have a low level meeting with Mr. Trimble a few weeks ago which turned into a very high level one. It was meant to happen without the press being informed but it was informed by people in Northern Ireland. However, I do not wish to involve myself in that one way or another.</P>
      <P>The meeting this morning was requested several weeks ago. It was to have taken place before the previous meeting I had with Sinn Féin but was delayed until after it. I stated the meeting should be low-key, short and on an issue and that was the case on all three counts.</P>
      <P>The SDLP was aware the meeting would take place. I spoke with John Hume yesterday and the day before and perhaps we will speak with SDLP members again in the next week. There is no connection between this meeting and the high level meeting which will take place in Derry tonight with John Hume and others and at which the Government will be represented by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, recently gave a postdated letter of resignation to the Chairman of the Assembly, Lord Alderdice. Subsequently, when he briefed the press he said that at a meeting he had had with the Taoiseach some days previously he had intimated to him that he would be following that course of action. A certain amount of confusion has arisen in the Taoiseach's replies to requests to clarify the matter. Can he clarify it now? Did he know in advance that Mr. Trimble was going to do what he did? What degree of knowledge did he have? Was there a hint which he did not pick up or was he told specifically of Mr. Trimble's intention to resign by way of postdated letter? </P>

He made no mention of this in any form. We spoke about the campaign and about how it might go. I understand from the British Prime Minister that he heard about the matter five minutes before it was announced. The Deputy First Minister, Mr. Séamas Mallon, heard about it two minutes before the announcement. As I undertstand it, Mr. Trimble's position is very clear in all this. He did things that way in order that presssure would not be brought to bear on him or any of his colleagues. This was his stated position made absolutely clear on the morning he made the announcement. There is no ambiguity whatsoever. Never have I heard of any ambiguity about the issue. It is absolutely clear. I have spoken about it with all the parties in the North. I do not want there to be any doubt about it.</P>

Will he further confirm that there is broad agreement on the shape that resolution might take? Will he share with me the concern expressed by many in relation to the revelations today that punishment beatings, another form of vigilante independent policing by paramilitaries on the loyalist or republican sides, have increased by up to 40%?

Does he agree that the real solution for those afflicted communities, be they green or orange, is a proper and acceptable form of community policing? Will he particularly condemn Sinn Féin, the only party within the Executive as distinct from the Assembly &ndash; I refer to loyalist parties with paramilitary connections &ndash; which has direct links with paramilitaries? The President of Sinn Féin has clearly indicated that its activities on the ground are directly related to the party's ability to win or retain support in west Belfast?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the period immediately after the election will be crucial. I also agree that it will be short. It will last until Drumcree Sunday. That period of the year starts the traditional holiday, the Orange festivities and all the good and difficulties which surround them. That is the traditional holiday break for people in Northern Ireland. For all those reasons it will be difficult to make progress after it. That has been my experience and that of my predecessors in recent years.</P>
      <P>I agree that policing is the key issue locking the others. All the parties are adamant that none of these issues is related. I do not say they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In one way or another they have an impact, and progress must be made on all of them if everyone is to feel satisfied and a comprehensive agreement reached. Everyone shares this view. We have made substantial progress on the policing issue, but not enough. There are clear lines of understanding of what we can achieve, how far the British Government would <Col N="1404" /> go, what can be handled by the RUC in its reform agenda and how close we can get back to the Patten recommendations from the moves that have been made. Certain compromises would have to be made by everyone, including the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the other pro-Agreement parties to achieve closure on the issue. They have all made their positions clear on the legislation. The question has been well and truly teased out since last July. We did our utmost in March and since to progress the issue.</P>
      <P>I also share the Deputy's concern about punishment beatings. The latest figures are accurate. I condemn in the strongest possible terms all punishment beatings and attacks by paramilitary groups. Today's figures are worrying. I have consistently urged, privately and publicly, that all such activity should cease immediately. I have been urged in this House to do so, most consistently by Deputy Currie, down through the years. At the meeting before last with Sinn Féin I spent some considerable time discussing the matter on which I have already reported to the House. I have discussed these attacks with all parties in the Assembly which have links with paramilitaries. I note that Sinn Féin and other parties which have links within their communities have continually said that what is now happening is a move towards gangsterism, banditry and drug related crime. That is not an excuse for any kind of punishment, not to mention the horrendous punishments we have seen. I think it is an excuse for sorting out the policing issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In all of these matters in Northern Ireland I have tried hard to understand why people carry out or condone such things as punishment beatings. I understand that if people &ndash; both loyalists and republicans, and nationalists and unionists &ndash; are under threat from public order breaches, they become frustrated about the difficulties that creates for their people. I do not understand the barbaric methods they use to deal with that. That is the reason we need a successful police recruitment campaign. That is the very argument for reform of the RUC, the implementation of the Patten proposals and for moving forward with policing matters. That is what I have said time and time again. It is the essential issue which I will raise again as soon as the parties are in negotiating mode after the British general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that paramilitary groups closely allied to political parties, who have not only added the intimidation of communities to their menu of horror but also illegal activities relating to drugs and other forms of gangsterism, including protection rackets, are an essential financial lifeline to those political parties? In the Taoiseach's view, is there a sense in which the political parties associated with paramilitary groups, including Sinn Féin and the loy<Col N="1405" /> alist parties, depend on that link in order to obtain the necessary funding to keep their activities going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to prove that position, as Deputy Quinn knows. There is no doubt about the existence of certain criminal activity, including counterfeiting, smuggling animals and fuel, and the sale of unlicensed drink &ndash; although the latter activity is not as evident nowadays. Whether such activity is also the backbone of financial support for political parties from paramilitary groups is less evident, although as we know from the recent foot and mouth disease outbreak, both issues arise &ndash; some involved criminals and some were linked to paramilitary organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about what has happened, what has developed and what has gone on for decades, the essential point is to end that. The way to do so is to have proper policing in the Border and other regions by a police service that has cross-community support, and that has Catholics and Protestants, Unionists and Nationalists, republicans and loyalists within that force who can work together to overcome such criminal activity. I do not see any chance of defeating that kind of crime other than by a respected and accepted police service. As we know, if a police service goes into certain areas that have no affiliation with it, it will not work. That is what the Patten report was all about. The way to deal with these issues is to have an acceptable police force that is as close to the Patten model as makes no difference. Such a force could have special units, not like the ones that are detested in the past, but which can deal with these difficulties in future. That makes sense and I hope it will be agreed by everybody soon.</P>

Since he was aware that the so-called informal meeting was taking place this morning with the North's Ministers for Education and Health &ndash; both Sinn Féin members &ndash; did he request his Ministers to convey directly to their opposite numbers the concerns of this House and of the Government about the damage done to the health and educational prospects of young people who have their knee-caps blown away in the name of some self-appointed vigilante group who, apparently because they are not active enough, according to Sinn Féin, are costing that party votes in West Belfast? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that every survey in his Department on deprived areas says that anti-social behaviour has a combined health and educational impact? If there is any commonality of concern it should be in relation to those two matters. It is incredible that the Taoiseach's Ministers did not raise these matters on the morning when the newspapers carried photographs of a victim of a punishment shooting, and we have statistics concerning paramilitary links to two Ministers from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not privy to what went on at the informal breakfast session; maybe they raised some of those issues. However, they were dealing with child welfare issues today which do not come directly within the ambit of what we are discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that while in this House we are all pretty sceptical about opinion polls, particularly when they are against us, the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> poll is welcome in so far as it seems to indicate that the tide has turned in support for the Good Friday Agreement? The referendum on that Agreement had 71% support, the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> poll indicates 77% support. In the Protestant community support for the Agreement was measured at 61% according to the latest poll, while last October it was only 47%. Would the Taoiseach agree with what many of us have felt for some time &ndash; that when ordinary people saw members of the Northern Ireland Executive grappling with common problems, support for the Executive would increase? One of the reasons for the increase in support for the Agreement could be that the North's Minister for Agriculture, Bríd Rodgers, has been so successfully grappling with the foot and mouth disease problem on behalf of all the people of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism of David Trimble for his, what I might describe as, frozen resignation. Would the Taoiseach agree that it is a bit strange for politicians to criticise other politicians for being politicians? If Mr. Trimble comes out of the election badly, many people in this House and elsewhere will say he should have done something to improve the situation. In current circumstances, I, for one, am not being critical of him, although I believe that in most cases the common <Col N="1407" /> interest should come before the interests of one's own party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's first point, the figures in that comprehensive poll are encouraging. Not alone have the poll figures in support of the Agreement recovered their position over the last year, but on the referendum, the straight question indicated that if the Agreement was being put to the people now it would be carried by 77% as opposed to 71% on 22 May 1998. That figure is very high. While I do not like the classification of the Catholic-Protestant divide in all of these issues, I understand why it is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to what the Deputy said but the way the question was put, and I understand why it was done. It shows an enormous increase in support for the Agreement from the Protestant community, back to one of its highest positions. Also, in both Nationalist parties it is now at 85% and 86% respectively. All that is extremely good. I entirely agree with the Deputy that people can see devolution is working well across a range of areas. It has worked well in health, education, industry and enterprise.</P>

      <P>Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has worked well in all areas, particularly in agriculture. Across the island of Ireland people have seen the superb job that has been done by Bríd Rodgers. It was probably the best example of devolution working there. This is also shown through health policies, including cancer strategies, which are extremely good. However, the foot and mouth disease outbreak had a high profile during a difficult period when the public and the economy were under strain. The economy has been turned around. The night before last Mr. Trimble pointed out in regard to his constituency that the economy has never been better, the number of debts has never been lower and unemployment is at an all-time low. These are positive facts which have emanated from the Good Friday Agreement in a strong and successful way.</P>
      <P>When I replied to Deputy Noonan earlier about Mr. Trimble, I outlined a factual position. I have avoided criticising the tactics of any of the parties because that is their call. They must make a call on one thing or other. The usual criticism of ourselves or the British Government is why somebody did something without telling the other. There have been many instances and I am sure they will continue. I understand that.</P>
      <P>I had an opportunity last night to talk to a number of the party leaders at another function about how they see things. They all expressed disquiet but these are political calls that are made when people must examine what is best for them. The UUP has criticised other parties and <i>vice versa</i>, but tactically people must do what they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The difficulties in regard to North-South Ministries, not finalising policing, not having more progress on demilitarisation or decommissioning and setting a date for that are concerns. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>However, as Northern Ireland approaches the upcoming Westminster election, by comparison with the previous election, there is an IRA ceasefire and a power-sharing Executive which is working well, North-South bodies, which are working well with one exception that has led to a serious difficulty since last October, but we must find a way to deal with it, and the economy is doing much better. The situation in which the Northern Ireland people find themselves is probably the best they have been in going into an election since the early 1960s. That has been pointed out in election literature, manifestos and documents which have been sent to the people there. We should be glad that is the position.</P>

      <P>I am deeply disappointed at the thrust of the questions that have been directed at the Taoiseach. Deputy Quinn spends his time misrepresenting the Sinn Féin position for reasons that have nothing to do with the reality on the ground in Belfast but everything to do with the reality on the ground that he is facing in the city of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>On 4 May the European Court of Human Rights made one of its most significant judgments ever in relation to Ireland when it judged that the British Government was guilty of abuse of human rights in the killing by its armed forces of 11 Irish people in the Six Counties. Will the Taoiseach back the call of the relatives who won this case for an international UN-led investigation into British state killings? Does he agree this should include assassinations by British forces and loyalists in the Twenty-Six Counties, such as the killing ten years ago of my party colleague and very dear friend, Donegal county councillor, Eddie Fullerton, in whose case there is compelling evidence of collusion between loyalists and British forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While the court did not reach a judgment on the lawfulness of the legal force used, it raised serious questions about the adequacy of the subsequent investigation, specifically in regard to the independence of the police investigations, the scope of the inquests and the proceedings, and the Director of Public Prosecutions. All those issues were spelt out in the investigations into Loughgall and other human rights issues. I have met several human rights action groups over the past six or seven years. <Col N="1409" /> They fought on this issue and were satisfied that they had made a substantive issue of this.</P>
      <P>The awarding of damages by the court underlines the view of the court regarding the adequacy of the investigations. With regard to the Government's position, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been asked to meet a representative of the groups to discuss the human rights issues that arise from the judgment and he has fixed a meeting following the British general election.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the human rights commission. Grave concern has been expressed that the commission in this State exists only in shadow form and the chief executive has yet to be appointed, which is preventing the commission from getting up and running. Is the Taoiseach aware the commission in the Six Counties is significantly advanced in its work by comparison and is preparing to go into the realm of a public consultation phase on a proposed Bill of rights? How does he respond to the criticism of his Government's approach to the European Convention on Human Rights Bill by the president-elect of the Human Rights Commission, former Supreme Court judge, Donal Barrington? Does all this not represent a serious setback to what should be an all-Ireland approach to human rights?</P>

That will happen and we will move very quickly to make up whatever ground has been lost. The Department has not lost all that time because it has continued to progress work over the past five or six months. As soon as the legislation is passed, the staff are appointed and the resources are expended by the Department, the commission will be up and running quickly.</P>

      <P>I wish to put two supplementary questions. The incidence of punishment beatings has increased by 40% since the start of the year to a total of 73 in the first five months. Does the Taoiseach's Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs log and examine these incidents? If the information is available, will the Taoiseach indicate how many are attributable to the republican movement and to loyalist paramilitaries? Does he think the increasing incidence of attacks is connected to the election campaign and that there is an attempt to intimidate for electoral purposes? What plans has he to ensure during the general election here in the next 12 months the republican movement will not intimidate, impersonate or try to attack our democratic institutions by subterfuge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are logged and monitored. Many groups continually raise these issues with my Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs and come in for meetings several <Col N="1410" /> times a year. A keen interest is taken in the figures. I do not have the figures but I was informed this morning that the figures in <i>The Irish Times</i> were correct. It stated that loyalist paramilitaries had been blamed for 48 of the incidents, with republicans responsible for 25.</P>
      <P>On the question of ensuring that progress is made on these issues and that they are not used for electoral purposes, I understand that in many of these communities there has been an enormous amount of pressure by people because public order has diminished, presumably due to the fact that things were done differently in the past. I do not have particular information on whether that has increased recently but the resolution of this problem, both in terms of those who are receiving punishment beatings and those who are meting out this kind of treatment, is to have proper policing on the ground. That applies here as much as in Northern Ireland. When there is an acceptable police force which is doing its job, with the proper powers and laws, these issues can be controlled. That is the resolution. I know that can only happen when the outstanding issues are resolved but it is the way forward and that is why people have to be determined to do it.</P>
      <P>In relation to intimidation or the misuse of any of the voting procedures, that is not an issue on which I have had discussion but clearly it is a matter of concern which has been raised with me by many public representatives.</P>

Why did it take this Government so long after the atrocity at Omagh to make representations to the US Government to have the Real IRA included in this list? Almost two years elapsed before the Taoiseach made diplomatic representation to have the Real IRA included in the terrorist list in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have always made the case, these dissident groups are acting against the express wish of the Irish people. From the time that organisation was set up in the autumn of 1997, representations and discussions took place with the American administration to assist in every way to thwart its activities, and those continued. The action that has taken place has gone on for the past year or so. The decision was not Government to Government alone. It was based on the best advice of the police authorities in the United Kingdom and here that that recommendation be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case was made at an early stage that dealing with the Real IRA in this form may not have the desired effect on the ground. In the early period it was felt that it might be the wrong thing to do and, while the organisation has been listed for a considerable time, it was not on the current classification. In terms of the additional effects of designation, it was listed as a terrorist organisation but it is now unlawful for a person in the <Col N="1411" /> US to provide funds or other material support to a designated organisation. Representatives and certain members of the organisation can be denied visas or excluded from the United States. I understand there are 27 organisations worldwide which have that designation. It also means that US financial institutions can block funds from designated organisations and their agents. Many of the organisations from Northern Ireland had not received that designation and it was only the consideration of the information from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the past 18 months, based on the reports of the British and the Garda intelligence, that led it to go all the way. The American administration is not anxious to put everybody on that separate list. It had listed the Real IRA as a terrorist organisation but this is a distinct identity as a designated terrorist organisation.</P>

      <P>In respect of Question No. 11 in my name, which refers to the issue of decommissioning, yesterday we put through the order to extend the regulations under the Decommissioning Act to make them operative until February of next year in line with the United Kingdom authorities. In the course of his recent meetings with the leadership of the republican movement, has the Taoiseach sought from it an indication as to why it has not yet initiated, in any significant way, the process of decommissioning beyond the point of contact with the de Chastelain Commission in light of the extraordinary progress that has been made on all other fronts in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the increase in popular support for it from both communities in Northern Ireland, as evidenced in the opinion polls published today? If he has raised the question of decommissioning with the republican movement and its leadership, what response, if any, has he got from them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this issue endlessly, including in the last two meetings which I referred to in my original reply. Some ongoing progress is being made with the de Chastelain Commission but we have not reached the desired situation. I hope those deliberations will lead to action. It is important that they do so and that we continue to make progress.</P>
      <P>The ultimate resolution of this issue is linked with the other issues in one form or other. We can make progress and we have had inspections and discussions between John de Chastelain and the head of the independent commission body. We have also had dialogue on a number of fronts but that still has not been sufficient. That effort is continuing and will continue even during the election period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sinn Féin would say it is using its best efforts to keep guns silent in the first place and to try to find a resolution of this issue, not just in terms of the Good Friday Agreement but all the discussions which took place since. Sinn Féin has <Col N="1412" /> made that very clear and since May last year the republican movement has been committed to putting arms beyond use in a way that is acceptable to the public at large.

      <Quest>if an investigation has commenced into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area pursuant to section 9 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924; if he intends to publish the reports of the earlier investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area; if he has received from the Garda Commissioner the reports completed to date; if so, if they will be lodged in the Library of Dáil Éireann; and his views on whether, in the public interest, a public inquiry should be conducted into these maters and also into the manner in which they have been dealt with to date by the Garda authorities.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks if an investigation has commenced into this matter pursuant to section 9 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924. The section in question provided for the Commissioner, or any other officer of the Garda Síochána nominated by the Commissioner, or for any person nominated by the Minister, to hold an inquiry and to examine on oath the truth of any charge or complaint of neglect or violation of duty preferred against any member of the Garda Síochána. However, the section was repealed by section 4 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and so does not provide a statutory basis for an inquiry.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Dublin Police Act, 1924, as applied by section 18 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, makes it lawful for any person nominated by the Minister to hold an inquiry and to examine on oath the truth of any charge or complaint of neglect or violation of duty preferred against any member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the 1924 provision is suited to inquiring into specific allegations against an individual member of the Garda Síochána, I am not sure it would provide an adequate vehicle for a comprehensive inquiry into the complexities of the Donegal case where there is a variety of issues and individuals involved. In any event, the provision is not applicable in relation to conduct alleged in admissible complaints made under the <Col N="1413" /> Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1996 &ndash; section 15(3) of the 1996 Act refers. As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, complaints have been made to the Complaints Board against members of the Garda Síochána in the context of this case.</P>
    <P>As I have also said to the Deputy previously, I want to see the truth of this matter determined. I know that this issue has been in the public domain for quite some time. Concerns about the handling of the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron appear to have been first raised in correspondence with my predecessor in 1997. I want to see public confidence in the Garda, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter, restored. The question is how we best achieve this in an open and transparent way that will achieve the desired results without interfering with potential civil and criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General as to whether I can proceed with any type of inquiry while civil and criminal proceedings are pending, and what the implications would be of such a course of action. While I obviously want to establish what happened in Donegal, I am sure all sides of the House will agree that it would not be acceptable to proceed in a way that would prejudice or jeopardise any of the proceedings which have been instituted, or proceedings which might yet be instituted. I will keep the House apprised of developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have already advised the House that a file in this matter, following Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation, has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Following receipt of directions from the DPP, one person, not a member of the Garda Síochána, has been arrested and charged. Further directions are awaited in respect of other aspects of the investigation. A number of civil actions relating to the case are outstanding.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner is already taking action to restore confidence. The Deputy will be aware that when the commissioner received the report of the assistant commissioner on the allegations in question, he decided, in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána, to transfer a number of personnel.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>I have also been recently informed by the Garda authorities that an inquiry under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, has been initiated by the Garda Commissioner with a view to investigating suspected breaches of discipline by a number of members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division arising from the investigation conducted by Assistant Commissioner Carty.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks if I intend to publish the reports of the earlier investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area and, in this regard, if I have received the completed reports from the Garda Commissioner. On the latter point, the Deputy will be aware from <Col N="1414" /> recent correspondence that I have not seen the investigation file nor would it be normal practice for the Minister to do so. I have, of course, as I have previously informed the House, received a report of the assistant commissioner's investigation from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Given the various investigations and proceedings ongoing in relation to this matter, I do not believe it would be appropriate at this time to publish any of the reports I have received in the matter nor to lodge them in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the truth of what happened in Donegal is established and becomes known to the public, while also ensuring that this is achieved in such a way that no proceedings are jeopardised so that justice can be done and be seen to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is unacceptable in a democratic society that serious allegations made against members, including senior members, of a police force go unaddressed by public inquiry and that the details of the veracity or otherwise of those allegations are left to mystery for over five years?</P>
      <P>Will he confirm that a third Garda investigation or inquiry is under way into allegations of Garda misconduct in County Donegal? Will he clarify the nature of that inquiry? Does he find it acceptable that allegations remain in the public arena of members of the Garda colluding in the hiding of armaments which they subsequently find? Does he also find it unacceptable that the circumstances surrounding the death of a young man on the roadway in 1996 have not been adequately investigated? Does he further find it unacceptable that 165 charges were brought against members of one family &ndash; the McBriarty family &ndash; all of which had to be withdrawn after lengthy court hearings?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is unacceptable, as he is aware from correspondence he recently received, that there are new allegations of Garda harassment of a member of the McBriarty family as recently as 5 May 2001 by a member of the Garda in Donegal?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether a circular distributed to Garda stations in County Donegal by senior members of the force, which alleged that members of the McBriarty family were financing a campaign to discredit the Garda, has been withdrawn?

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the relevant judgments are lengthy &ndash; in all they amount to approximately 160 pages of single spacing text. In <Col N="1417" /> particular, they deal with a wide range of complex legal and other matters and, in the circumstances, it is clear that the issues raised require detailed consideration before a final decision can be made on what changes are necessary in this country in order to ensure that there is full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is already aware, I have been engaged in a major review of the Garda complaints arrangements generally, including the operation of the Garda Complaints Act, and the question of establishing an independent inspectorate for the Garda Síochána. The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights will be highly relevant to this review.</P>

      <P>In light of this fact, and the fact that the Minister has had some time to reflect on the issue, will he acknowledge that there is an absolute requirement on him to introduce legislation to ensure that there would be an independent, that is, a non-Garda investigation &ndash; the terms of the judgment are quite clear &ndash; of a case in which there was any question over the taking of life by members of the Garda? Does he accept that such an investigation, in order to comply with the European convention, would have to be carried out externally? When will that legislation be ready or is the Minister determined to wait until Ireland is brought before the European Court before acting to regularise the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the European Court's judgment is that it was not satisfied with the procedures implemented in three particular areas. The court appeared to believe there was a lack of independence on the part of the police officers who investigated the incidents in question. In addition, it believed that although certain prosecutions were authorised, there was a general lack of public scrutiny. It also said the inquest procedures undertaken did not permit any verdict or findings which could play an effective role in securing a prosecution of any criminal offence which may have been disclosed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if this applies to an analogous situation in this jurisdiction. That is being studied within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General. The judgment has implications for this jurisdiction, <i>prima facie</i>. In the circumstances, it appears that change will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated that I intend to introduce changes to the Garda complaints legislation and the review within the Department is now virtually ready for presentation. I have my own views in relation to it. In that context, the Deputy brought forward some good ideas on how matters might <Col N="1418" /> be improved.

Does he accept that there is no provision for what is defined in the European Court judgment as &ldquo;practical independence&rdquo; from the Garda Síochána in any investigation into a shooting carried out by gardaí? To address this requirement in the unanimous decision of the European Court, we will have to amend our law not just in the token way suggested to date by tinkering with the Garda complaints legislation but in a more fundamental way by establishing an independent investigative authority. Will the Minister accede to my request that the heads of the Bill or at least proposals on the matter be brought to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights before a Bill is finalised or approved by Government?</P>

      <P>The policies I have implemented since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have resulted in a <Col N="1419" /> major crackdown on organised crime. Strong legislation specifically designed to target organised crime has been introduced, backed up by tough law enforcement measures. I have, for example, put in place the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. The Act has also introduced a range of new measures designed to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those assisting the Garda in the investigation of an offence and their families, and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for such offences.</P>
      <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced when in opposition, has been successfully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activity from enjoying the benefits of their ill gotten gains. This legislation and the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau have received much praise both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>On the law enforcement side, specialised Garda units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation have been established to tackle organised crime, seize assets of organised criminals and bring them before the courts. The successes of these units are well documented and it would be useful to refer briefly to them at this point. Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 2000 the bureau has obtained section 2 interim orders on property to a total value of over £8 million and section 3 interlocutory orders on property to a total value of over £7 million under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded over £37 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to over £1.6 million.</P>
      <P>From 1998 to 2000, seizures of illicit drugs amounted to an estimated street value of over £132 million and the money laundering investigation unit of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation received almost 4,500 suspicious transaction reports with a value of over £590 million. In addition, special measures such as the witness security programme have been developed to prevent criminals from intimidating those who assist the authorities in bringing criminals to justice and has been used successfully to date in organised crime investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>One of the difficulties facing all law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime is the fact that these criminal organisations are now operating at an international level and flexible enough in their operations to take advantage of any new opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, the response to organised crime <Col N="1420" /> must be an international one. Ireland participates fully in the fight against organised crime at both EU level and beyond. At EU level a range of measures from the 1997 EU action plan on organised crime have been agreed, with the intention of improving co-operation between national law enforcement agencies in order to tackle international organised criminal groups more effectively. Following on from this action plan a new EU strategy for the prevention and control of organised crime for the beginning of the new millennium has been adopted.</P>
    <P>International agencies such as Europol and Interpol have an important role to play in dealing with international organised crime and the Garda is in regular contact with these agencies through the Garda liaison officers posted to Europol and Interpol headquarters. In December 2000, I signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and two protocols to the convention &ndash; the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the protocol against smuggling of migrants by land, air and sea.</P>
    <P>The legislative and law enforcement measures introduced have been recognised as a major step forward in the fight against organised crime in Ireland and resulted in the dismantling of major organised crime gangs and the imprisonment of a number of significant criminals. Our legislation is among the most effective in Europe when it comes to combating organised crime, a fact well recognised by our EU partners. That is not to say, however, that there is any complacency on my behalf. In this context, I am constantly evaluating our response to organised crime and whatever steps are necessary will be taken to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of reports that since some of the gangs that existed in the mid-1990s were broken up, there are now 12 major gangs dominating drug and other serious crime in the State? Can he indicate what steps are being taken to target these gangs? When will action be taken to bring an end to their activities? Will the Minister explain the reason these gangs are not getting the same intensive Garda treatment the other gangs, some of whose leaders are serving terms of imprisonment while others have fled the country and are living outside the jurisdiction, received?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of organised criminal groups is determined each year by using the European Union definition of organised crime in connection with the compilation of the EU situation report on organised crime. The most recently completed situation report identified 12 Irish organised crime groups and 68 other less significant organised crime groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is untrue to suggest that these criminal groups are allowed to operate as if there was no <Col N="1421" /> police force or law enforcement agency in the State. The legislation introduced since the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 through to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Criminal Justice Act, 1999 contains some of the toughest measures ever introduced in a democracy to crack down on criminal elements. I have outlined the success of the Criminal Asset Bureau. Unquestionably, the people concerned who believed they were untouchable in the past now know they run a high risk of losing their illicit assets. They also run a high risk of being imprisoned for a long period, if convicted by the court.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that since we created an additional 1,300 prison spaces and are well on the way to increasing it to 2,000, an increase of almost 100% since the Government came into office, those sentenced by the courts serve their sentences. This is of considerable importance because the fact that people were being released on the sole criterion that there was insufficient space for them in prison was leading to disrespect for the criminal law. I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána and the various units of that organisation concerned with organised crime are doing everything they can to enforce some of the toughest laws in Europe.</P>

Will the Minister indicate what special steps are being taken to target these gangs? Does he agree they should be targeted? Does he agree it is contrary to the public interest that such gangs would be allowed to continue to engage in their current activities and will he explain why he failed to address this issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement on immigration matters between Ireland and Nigeria, which was approved by the Government on 27 March 2001 and which I intend to sign as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, provides a mechanism for the repatriation of a person in respect of whom a decision to deport has been made. The agreement itself has nothing to do with a decision to deport.</P>
      <P>In line with usual practice in relation to such agreements, the text will be made available as soon as signature takes place. Thereafter, as this is an international agreement which will involve a charge on public funds, its terms must, under Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution, be approved by Dáil Éireann for it to be binding on the State. Provision is made in the agreement that it will not come into force until Ireland and Nigeria notify each other of completion of domestic procedures required for its entry into force. I will table the necessary resolution in the House at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the agreement were outlined in reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 23 of 12 April and No. 503 of 1 May. The agreement will replace the present <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with the Nigerian authorities for the return of their nationals who are residing illegally in the State and will provide an agreed mechanism and structured framework for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in Irish law which requires me to make inquiries after a person has been deported in relation to the position of that person. On the contrary, the position is that such inquiries must be made in advance of the deportation and any such decision is subject to review by the courts. In the context of the determination of an asylum application at first instance and at the appeals stage, detailed inquiries are carried out on the basis of comprehensive country of origin information, which is updated on an ongoing basis, by both the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as to whether an applicant for asylum has a well founded fear of persecution having regard to the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> In addition, the Immigration Act, 1999 sets out in a transparent way, the principles, powers and procedures governing the deportation process. These principles include a requirement that the person be given a 15 day period within which to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made. Even if representations are not made, I am required to have regard to 11 different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether a deportation order should be made.</P>
    <P>Lastly, but most importantly, the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which absolutely forbids the sending of a person &ldquo;in any manner whatsoever&rdquo; to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This overarching principle is the bedrock of Ireland's repatriation framework and cannot be circumvented by the provisions of a repatriation agreement to which the State becomes a party.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the procedures of any such agreement, including the Nigerian agreement, cannot be invoked in an individual case in advance of the foregoing provisions of national legislation being applied. It is also open to a person who is not satisfied with the manner in which national legislative provisions have been applied to challenge the validity of any deportation order made by way of an application for judicial review in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, and legal aid is available for that purpose. Some 85 such cases involving Nigerian nationals are currently before the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Between initial decisions and appeal applications, more than 5,000 asylum seekers of Nigerian origin are awaiting decisions on their applications? Will he also confirm that only 45 Nigerian nationals have been granted asylum in this State since 1995? Will he indicate whether he is aware that in February 2000, more than 2,000 people were killed in religious fighting in northern Kaduna state when the governor considered implementing a sharia law? Is the Minister aware that in October 2000, 300 people died in Lagos during four days of tribal clashes? Perhaps the Minister would indicate to the House what inquiries of any nature he has conducted to ascertain whether Nigerian asylum seekers currently living in Ireland will be placed at serious risk if deported to Nigeria? Is it simply the Minister's intention to create a situation in which any Nigerian national who seeks asylum here would be automatically returned to Nigeria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Nigeria represented the largest source country for asylum seekers in Ireland last year. Of the 10,938 people who sought asylum during 2000, 3,404 or 31.1% were from Nigeria. In 1999, the number of asylum applications received <Col N="1424" /> from Nigerian nationals was 1,895 or 24.5% and until 13 April this year, Nigerian nationals represented approximately 37% of all applications received. Recent UNHCR statistics indicate that of all EU member states, Ireland was the largest recipient of asylum applications from Nigeria in 1999 and 2000. In 1996, the number of Nigerian asylum applicants in Ireland was nine.</P>
      <P>Nigeria is a democratic federal republic which held elections in 1998 and 1999 following a period of military rule. It is generally accepted that the human rights situation in most parts of Nigeria has improved since President Obasanjo came to power in May 1999. President Obasanjo established a human rights violations investigation commission to investigate major human rights abuses committed between 1976 and the return of civilian rule in 1998 with the objective of reconciliation. Nigeria has acceded to a number of international conventions including the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and the related 1967 protocol. Together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, the Government will continue to encourage the Nigerian elected authorities to further strengthen the protection of human rights in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, a person must be granted refugee status in this country if he or she would otherwise be returned to a country in which he or she would suffer persecution or death. If a person's initial application is refused, he or she can avail of an appeals process. The Minister must subsequently have regard to certain factors within a period of 15 days and an individual can also seek a judicial review. The safeguards are very comprehensive.</P>

      <P>A newspaper article, published on Sunday, 11 February 2001, alleged that members of the Garda Síochána and a civilian employee at Garda headquarters had participated in trips abroad paid for by a company which supplies tyres to the Garda Síochána. On 13 February 2001, I advised the House that the Garda Commissioner had asked a chief superintendent to examine the allegations. I also advised the House that I was of the view that the matter warranted an external examination and that the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote, had instructed the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The matter subsequently became the subject of a criminal investigation and I have been informed that the chief superintendent appointed by the Garda Commissioner has completed a full investigation file into the matters alleged and a copy has been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration.

However, I am treating the matter very seriously and that is why it is being investigated. It is not only an audit; it is an investigation into what I regard as very serious allegations which may have serious consequences. The chips will fall where the blame lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that since Friday, 2 March 2001 Garda investigations into the illegal importation of animals into Ireland have been co-ordinated by a detective chief superintendent in charge of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. On that date, an incident room was set up in Ardee, County Louth, and subsequently at a number of locations around the country. A Garda liaison office was also established in the Ballymacscanlon Hotel, Dundalk &ndash; it is a famous place &ndash; to facilitate liaison with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that an indepth investigation has taken place in the Cooley Peninsula area of County Louth in connection with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease at Proleek Lower and that all animals on critical consignments coming into the country at the time have been traced and slaughtered. As a result of the Garda investigation, a number of persons suspected of involvement in the illegal importation of animals into the country were identified and are currently the subject of investigation. I understand that six arrests have been made and that one person stands charged before the courts. Moreover, a number of files are currently being prepared by the Garda Síochána for submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I further understand that the Garda investigation is ongoing and that more arrests are expected. This aspect of the investigation involves approximately 900 sheep. While the Deputy's question refers to sheep, I wish to point out that a number of cattle have also been smuggled and that this matter is under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of arrests and prosecutions instituted during the years 1999 and 2000 is not readily available. The Garda authorities have, however, informed me that, during these years, a small number of persons were charged and con<Col N="1429" /> victed in relation to a variety of offences relating to the illegal importation of animals into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three specific questions for the Minister. As he is aware, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has highlighted the irregularities in the ewe premium scheme in the Cooley Peninsula involving 6,000 extra sheep. Does the Minister have any evidence that some or all of those 6,000 animals crossed the Border from Northern Ireland? When the IFA and many others, including myself four years ago, brought this issue to the attention of the House and the Government, the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, did very little to stop it, although everybody knew it was happening.</P>

Can genuine sheep farmers whose dealings are all above board expect from now on that their livelihoods will be protected from this type of illegal importation of UK sheep via Northern Ireland? It appears that over the past two or three years, there have been no prosecutions. The Minister's Department did not lay a hand on any of the wrongdoers.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Connaughton knows, the Garda Síochána has investigated various matters arising from the illegal movement of animals. As I explained, one person has been charged and other people can expect to be charged. With regard to what happened historically, the movement of sheep across the Border, in so far as I understand it, prior to 21 February 2001 was not illegal.</P>

      <P>However, it would be illegal to import sheep from the United Kingdom into the North and then to the South. Cattle smuggling was always a criminal offence. However, where the Garda receive information about these matters, it follows it up to the best of its ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the investigations ongoing or concluded in so far as they focus on the determination of the source of the contamination that led to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in County Louth? Has the investigation determined to date whether there was any paramilitary involvement in the sheep smuggling at the centre of this investigation? Will the Minister outline the level of co-ordination between the Garda Síochána, the RUC and the Northern Ireland authorities and how it is progressing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any evidence that there were any illegal movements since 21 February. The investigations by the Garda Síochána are an ongoing part of Garda operations, especially in Border Garda divisions, irrespective of the presence of foot and mouth disease. Since the outbreak of the disease the Garda Síochána has been involved in specific investigations of sheep smuggled connected with the outbreak. Prior to the restrictions imposed following the outbreak there was widespread illegal movement of sheep between the North and the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my reply, the Garda investigation is ongoing on the question of whether there was a subversive or paramilitary element involved in the sheep smuggling. It is envisaged that a number of files will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. If I engage in speculation on <Col N="1431" /> this matter I might compromise their efforts. Neither Deputy Howlin nor I want that to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that the total manpower strength for all ranks of the Garda Síochána as at 1 May 2001 is 11,666. Garda numbers have not ever been higher in the history of the State than the level being achieved this year. I am further informed that Garda personnel operate according to a number of rosters in order to maximise the available resources during the busiest periods and that the number of Garda personnel on duty during daytime and night time hours can vary from day to day and location to location according to the exigencies of the service. As such, the information sought by the Deputy regarding average numbers on patrol is not readily available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asks whether the overall number of gardaí should be increased. When I came into office in 1997, there were approximately 10,800 gardaí. There are now 11,666, an increase of 866 personnel. Last year, the Government approved my proposals for the recruitment of 500 Garda trainees and the first of these will commence training this year. I am pleased this latest recruitment will fulfil the Government commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to a record 12,000 by 2002. The question of further recruitment is being kept under review in my Department and I will bring any proposals in this regard to Government in the usual manner.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that many people are being terrorised on our streets by day and by night? Does he accept that public order offences appear to be on the increase? Does he agree that having members of the Garda Síochána on foot patrol is a deterrent to such offences? If so why are there not more gardaí on the beat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner recently indicated that he will ensure that certain areas with public order difficulties will be specifically targeted. I am concerned at any degree of public disorder and I agree the number of gardaí on the beat can have a great relevance in terms of bringing down the number of people who commit these kinds of offences. In that context it is not the intention to just increase the numbers of <Col N="1432" /> gardaí, as we have done, but to introduce civilianisation. This should release up to 560 members of the Garda Síochána from behind desks on to the streets. I expect 170 to be released under this programme this year with the remaining numbers over the following two years so that we will ensure that the highly trained members of the force have their talents maximised in terms of their service to the public.</P>

      <P>Both actions referred to by the Deputy arose from the same incident in which two off duty Garda members were involved in a fracas outside a hotel in County Clare on 3 August 1993. As a result of the incident, both Garda members were prosecuted and found guilty in the District Court, on 11 May 1994, of common assault and drunk and disorderly behaviour. Both were fined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the first case referred to by the Deputy, a dismissal order was made by the then Commissioner, with the consent of the then Minister, on 30 January 1995, dismissing the garda from the force with effect from 13 February 1995. The Commissioner maintained that the garda was unfit for retention. In July 1995, the garda concerned applied for a judicial review of the Commissioner's decision, maintaining that the Commissioner had acted unreasonably and not taken the full facts of the case into account when making his decision. The case was listed for hearing on 1 December 1999, when a settlement was reached on the basis of legal advice. As a result of the settlement, the garda obtained an order of <i>certiorari</i> quashing the decision and the dismissal order made by the Commissioner. The settlement also provided that the garda be reinstated and suspended pending the outcome of a sworn inquiry conducted in accordance with the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989. It was also agreed that the State would discharge the <Col N="1435" /> garda's costs. These amounted to £71,584. The total legal costs involved came to £81,746.</P>
    <P>In the second case, the garda concerned was also dismissed by order of the Commissioner, with the consent of the then Minister, with effect from 7 October 1994. The then Commissioner was also of the view that the member was unfit for retention in the force. Legal proceedings were initiated in April 2000. The case has not come to trial and the Deputy will appreciate that, as it is still outstanding, I cannot discuss details of the case.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information contained in the reply which to be fair is common knowledge. I agree that the question mainly concerns expenditure and compensation. Does the Minister agree that the full force of the State has been employed by the Garda in pursuing the individual gardaí concerned and that perhaps Garda management does not have any reason to be proud of its record in this regard? The process would benefit from some transparency. Does the Minister agree that the precedent set in the case of the first garda should be looked at carefully by the authorities in relation to the pending case?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(3) The commission shall, within 6 months of its appointment, publish comprehensive guidelines and definitions on what constitutes &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; or &ldquo;social deviance&rdquo; as described in this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy Neville).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We were speaking about the guidelines and definition of &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo;. The Minister of State made the point that the interpretation of social deviancy should be made on a clinical basis, that a clinician should decide on the matter of social deviance and personality disorder. While there is some merit in having a clinician decide what is a personality disorder, how does a clinician decide what is socially deviant in the light of our previous discussion when we outlined that social deviancy may be different for those from different ethnic groups and cultural backgrounds in our developing multi-racial society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill which I find difficult to understand. What we are trying to do is ensure an involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre will not take place because a person is suffering from a personality disorder and socially deviant. One could have someone interpret social deviancy in various ways because of their ethnic background. I take issue with the defining of these issues because, as we are all aware, in practically every Bill there is a section dealing with interpretation of terms. In section 2 of the Bill there is an interpretation of what is an admission order, an application, an approved centre, an inspector and a renewal order. There <Col N="1437" /> is even an interpretation of what is a relative &ndash; rightly so &ndash; but there is no definition of what is a social deviant in the context of the legislation. While I appreciate the difficulty in introducing such a measure, my amendment under which the commission would examine the issue and report on it would improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I again support Deputy Neville on this point because it is stated in the Bill that a person cannot be involuntarily committed by reason only of personality disorder or social deviancy. However, those reasons could be given as part of the justification for committal. Were one to ask every Member of the House what was meant by this, one would receive a different answer from each. If one were to ask every Member of the House what social deviance meant, one would get a different answer. Some people feel threatened by the type of eccentric behaviour one sometimes sees in the street, while others would say it is part of human eccentricity and would not be bothered by it. When is social deviance considered to be such and when is it not? It is not acceptable to put such a significant concept into a Bill without at least defining or including a mechanism to define what it means. One could embark on a long and learned social and cultural treatise on social deviance. It is important to get the definition right. I would have thought a commission which has been charged with various duties could also be charged with this duty. Before Question Time, the Minister of State said this was not part of the commission's duties.</P>

      <P>It is important to point out that the medical experts will determine whether the person suffers from a mental disorder. They are not being asked to define whether the person is socially deviant but whether they suffer from a mental disorder. It is on that basis that the involuntary admission would be made. That would be reviewed after the limited time of 21 days. The arguments made by the Deputy show how impossible it would be to define social deviance, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether the person is suffering from a mental disorder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I did not try to interpret it in an amendment. We want the commission to publish comprehensive guidelines on what it believes constitutes personality disorder or social deviancy. I am not trying to interpret those terms, but there should be a mechanism to interpret them. The Minister of State said this issue is not the responsibility of the commission. We tabled the amendment to make it a responsibility of the mental health commission and to ensure there is no confusion and that clinicians do not make different interpretations. We do not want a person whom this section ensures will not be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric institution to be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric institution because of a clinician's interpretation of the terms. There is confusion among clinicians about personality disorder. There are clinicians who strongly maintain that there is no such thing as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That is an example of how clinicians differ. They will also differ about the meaning of social deviancy. Some clinicians may interpret personality disorder as mental illness.</P>
      <P>We, as legislators, must examine this subsection and give the new commission the responsibility to report back to the Minister and to publish comprehensive guidelines. Because this area is difficult, we did not suggest it should publish comprehensive interpretations of those terms. We want guidelines to ensure consistency between clinicians and the different institutions which make decisions about involuntarily admissions. We want the commission to examine this and to publish guidelines. We are not trying to interpret these terms but we are asking for a system to be put in place to clarify and protect section 7(2).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 49, to delete &ldquo;28&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;21&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of how long a person should be involuntarily detained before his or her case is reviewed has been one of the contentious issues in this Bill. The 28 day timescale for an initial detention envisaged in the Bill was criticised on Committee Stage. The Minister listened carefully to all the arguments made and appreciates the concerns various interests have in relation to the length of time it will take to complete a person's review. However, the Minister also has a duty to ensure that whatever legislation is enacted by this House is realistic and can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logistical implications of the review process proposed under this Bill are enormous. At present there are approximately 2,400 involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals per year. Every admission will have a review process initiated in respect of it. The Department has estimated that approximately 2,000 completed reviews per year will be required under the provisions of this Bill. A volume of this magnitude will require a substantial investment in staffing and information technology, and comprehensive training for all personnel involved to ensure that <Col N="1440" /> the time scale involved in this Bill is complied with in all cases.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the issue comprehensively, and bearing in mind the concerns expressed about civil liberties and the administrative implications, the Minister has come to the conclusion that 21 days is the absolute minimum required to guarantee a completed review within the statutory time scale. This is for every person admitted involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital. Accordingly, the amendments proposed for the Bill will reduce the time scale for an admission order and for the completion of a review from 28 days to 21 days.</P>
    <P>If, once the system is up and running, it is found that the volume of cases is lower than anticipated, or that the administrative process is quicker and more efficient than anticipated, the Minister is prepared to revisit this issue and to change the Act if necessary. To that end, amendment No. 42 requires the commission to review the operation of his part of the Act within 18 months of its commencement, and to submit a report in writing to the Minister on the operation of the process together with any findings, conclusions or recommendations that he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>I envisage that this report will include any recommendations that are necessary to further reduce the 21 days time scale. I hope Deputies appreciate the Minister's goodwill in this regard.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 27 deal with a point which was raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Committee Stage. The Deputy made the point that section 14(2) does not allow the consultant psychiatrist the discretion to make a renewal order for a period shorter than three months. The amendment now tabled changes the text to read &ldquo;for a further period not exceeding three months,&rdquo; which achieves the desired effect. Further amendments in the name of the Minister extend that concept to references to renewal orders in section 14. Similarly, I have amended the relevant section dealing with children in section 24 to ensure that the court has the discretion to make renewal orders for periods not exceeding three months, six months or 12 months, as the case may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 13, we can debate the length of time the examination should take. There are concerns about that section of the Bill. Although the Minister has moved from 28 days to 21 days, our amendment suggests that the period should be 14 days. There has been strong lobbying from the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland to reduce that to seven days. The organisation represents the mentally ill and those with schizophrenia, and it has closely examined this situation and recommended this reduction. I listened closely to the Minister on Committee Stage, and felt that some space should be granted on this matter. It was thought that an amendment to a 14 day period had a better chance of being accepted than seven days. While <Col N="1441" /> the Minister has moved, a further move to 14 days should be accepted.</P>
      <P>If the mental health services have a period of 21 days before they can make a review, they will ensure that any examination will hold up for a full 21 days. It is difficult to debate, to discuss and to have an opinion examined by consultant psychiatrists. They have a strong opinion that lay people must respect their views without question. Lay people may play a part in encouraging this attitude as we are often in awe of qualified psychiatrists. Lay people often feel they are being examined as they speak to a psychiatrist. That is not true, but lay people have put them in a high position and psychiatrists have been glad to accept that position. They feel they are not to be questioned and know everything about these matters.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to examine a decision by a consultant psychiatrist such as to discharge a suicidal mentally ill patient from hospital. One can attempt to probe the decision, but all health board officials can say is that it was a clinical decision. They are not in a position to question a clinical decision of a consultant psychiatrist. The consultant psychiatry profession will ensure that as there are 21 days for examination, 21 days will apply. They will use their power to ensure they are not put under further pressure.</P>
      <P>A 14 day period will put the system under maximum pressure to ensure that nobody is detained in a psychiatric institution longer than they should be. Even 14 days is too long, according to the experienced Schizophrenia Association of Ireland. It says seven days, while we say 14 days to ensure that admission orders shall authorise the reception, detention and treatment of a patient concerned, and shall remain in force for that period, from the date of making the order. This is subject to subsection (2) which will then expire.</P>
      <P>There should be pressure exerted by the Department to ensure maximum performance in this area. I assure the Minister of State that if this Bill is not changed now, a future examination of the system will not facilitate a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great concerns about the Minister's approach. I welcome that there is some reduction in the time frame but this is very modest. It does not meet the needs. The Minister of State has said there is an obligation on the Minister to ensure there is a realistic approach to the functioning of the process. However, it must also be an effective process and one that meets the requirement to provide a mechanism to protect people incarcerated unnecessarily or wrongly. A 21 day period does not compare favourably with the views expressed by the ICCl and by the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland, who have both argued for a seven day time frame. The Labour Party recognises that seven days is ambitious and has recommended ten days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been subject to criticism by the UN Committee on Human Rights about <Col N="1442" /> the time frame proposed. The UN committee compared our timeframe with the much shorter timeframe of as low as two days in other countries. I would have thought the White Paper on Mental Health would have been used as a guide in this area. Surely we should be paying attention to the recommendations it contains and, in respect of this matter, it recommended a period of seven days. I welcome the amendment tabled by the Minister of State which deals with the renewal of periods up to six months. That amendment, however, does not deal with how the review process will work. I do not believe a period of 21 days is satisfactory, particularly when one considers that 70% of people are released within one month in any event and that not many people will be incarcerated for 21 days or more.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined the numbers involved, but that is a matter of guesswork as much as anything else. On Committee Stage, I made the point that everyone would understand if difficulties arose in terms of the start-up date. Had the Minister for Health and Children decided &ndash; I thought he would do so &ndash; to provide a window in which the training, preparation and backlog might be dealt with, I am sure people would understand that, for a period, there might be delays in terms of delivering this protection. I had believed that once the lead-in period was completed a procedure would be established which would be effective as well as being realistic. It is for that reason that we put forward a ten day review period.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when the commission is asked to produce a report in 18 months, it is far more likely to propose that there be a longer rather than a shorter timeframe. That is the nature of the beast. Why would any commission determine that the timeframe should be shorter when the Government has laid out in legislation the length of time which should elapse before the review takes place?</P>
    <P>We have made some progress in terms of amending this Bill. However, I notice there is a tendency on Committee Stage for Ministers to give a commitment to consider an issue but when we return to it on Report Stage it is clear that significant changes have not been contemplated. In this instance, I am glad for the individuals involved that there will be a reduction of seven days. However, the approach being taken is extremely minimalist. Had the new framework been in place in the past, it would probably have protected people in a fundamental way and altered some of their lives. That is history, however, and we must ensure that what we are doing will provide good safeguards within a reasonable timeframe. I welcome the reduction in the period, but it is very limited. It is disappointing that the Minister did not show a little more courage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction from 28 days to 21 days is based not just on respect for civil liberties and the fact that in these type of involuntary admissions the liberty of persons will be taken <Col N="1443" /> away, but also on the realisation that we must ensure that the process can run its course and that the review can take place. There is quite a difference between the type of review proposed in the Bill and that to which the White Paper referred. The review mentioned in the White Paper was a seven day paper or procedural review, whereas the Bill provides for a substantive review including a full examination of a patient by an independent consultant. It is to ensure that such reviews will be allowed to take place that a period of 21 days is being proposed. It is the Minister's hope that the period could be shortened and that the process will be extremely efficient. However, we do not want to delay the enactment of the Bill simply because we would not be able to find the staff, technology, etc., in time to allow a review to be carried out in the short periods &ndash; ten or 14 days &ndash; proposed by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>Following the review of the work of the commission after 18 months, I hope recommendations will be forthcoming for a period of less than 21 days to be put in place. Bearing everything in mind, however, the Minister is satisfied that it would not be feasible or practical to carry out such a substantial review in under 21 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State is not in a position to respond positively to our amendments. On Committee Stage, the Minister for Health and Children was as adamant about a period of 28 days as she is being now about a period of 21 days. Those involved at the coalface have stated that a review should take place after seven days. The Minister of State has indicated that the system is so bad, outdated and underfunded that a person who has been detained against their will and, perhaps, physically admitted to an institution can request a review but that the State will not oblige that institution to review their situation for up to 21 days. I would have thought that their situation should be reviewed on request. I accept, however, that this might be going too far. The associations involved in the area believed that seven days is a reasonable period and we are proposing that this be doubled to 14 days. Surely the institutions can carry out reviews in two rather than three weeks, because this would significantly improve the rights of those who have been involuntarily admitted to mental institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that it would be desirable that people would not be held involuntarily if the professional opinion was that this was inappropriate. It is important, therefore, that the professional opinion to which I refer should be obtained. However, the advice is that it would not be possible to guarantee the 2,000 to 2,400 people who are admitted to institutions each year that their cases would be reviewed unless the 21 day period is put in place. I hope that period can be reduced, but I do not wish to delay the enactment of the Bill while waiting for the day to arrive <Col N="1444" /> when a review could be carried out in a shorter timeframe. That is why the proposed period is being reduced from 28 to 21 days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 39 and 40, after &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and that the approved centre has staff, resources and facilities adequate for the treatment of that disorder&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because I was concerned about the referral of an admission or renewal order to the tribunal. The tribunal is obviously empowered in the review procedure it will conduct to examine certain aspects of an admission or renewal order for a patient suffering from a mental disorder to ensure the procedures are correct and the law has been abided by. I find it curious there is not any reference to ensure the tribunal can consider the centre in which the person has been placed, whether it is the appropriate place for the treatment of the person and whether it is properly resourced to ensure the person &ndash; if capable of being treated effectively &ndash; can receive the treatment he or she needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume this issue would not arise in the vast majority of cases, but we must examine the issues which may arise and, which need to be dealt with in legislation if that legislation is to be well worked and constructed. It is possible for a person's case to be considered by a tribunal, for information to be given to the tribunal that the <Col N="1445" /> person was correctly admitted according to the law and that he or she has a mental disorder, but for that person to be inappropriately placed in a centre which, while approved, is not capable of meeting the treatment needs of that individual. I presume in that case the tribunal would have to say that it could not examine that aspect of the review because it does not have the power under the legislation to do so and that, while it knows the person in question is inappropriately placed, it cannot examine that aspect of the review.</P>
    <P>I would be only too delighted were the Minister of State to say this is provided for in another part of the Bill. It could easily happen that an approved centre with a certain standard of care may not meet the need of an individual suffering from a certain type of disorder for a certain type of care. That is not inconceivable, but it appears that, in law, the tribunal could not examine that as an issue in terms of considering the renewal or admission order. I would have thought that was part of the work of a tribunal. It does not give much confidence or hope if all the procedures, including a procedure to protect an admitted person's rights, can be gone through perfectly correctly where a person is incarcerated against his or her will by being involuntarily admitted and no consideration can be given by the tribunal charged with the duty of ensuring the rights of that person are protected to the fact that he or she is in a place that is not appropriate to his or her needs. I would have thought it would improve the Bill to include this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McManus. This refers to the previous discussion about the level of resources available for the proper delivery of services to people in mental hospitals, be they voluntary or involuntary admissions. We are aware that approved centres sometimes do not have adequate staff and facilities for the treatment of certain disorders.</P>
      <P>A psychiatric institution despite the skills therein to treat the mentally ill is not a suitable place for people with a mental disability. Such people, the intellectually challenged as they are called now, should not be treated in the same way as those suffering from illness because they are not ill. They require a different environment. They require a place where they are safe and where they can have as full a life, as full enjoyment and as best a quality of life as possible. They will not receive that in a psychiatric institution because it is not established to provide that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not confined to people with a mental disability who are involuntarily admitted. Any such person who is in a psychiatric institution voluntarily is in essence there involuntarily in that he or she is not in a position to give full consent and question the type of service he or she receives or the type of environment in which he or she is located. The amendment, although it only deals with involuntary admission to mental institutions, should be accepted. Resources, facilities and staff should be provided to all psychiatric <Col N="1446" /> institutions to deal with all aspects of patients' conditions. It goes without saying that those with an intellectual disability should not be in a psychiatric institution. I know there are some proposals and movement to deal with that but such people should not ever have been admitted to begin with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy McManus's amendments and her concern that approved centres should have the staff, resources and facilities adequate for the treatment of patients. I also appreciate the sentiments behind the amendment which requires regulations to be made to prescribe requirements for accurate clinical diagnosis and to avoid the excessive prescription of medication. However, the most appropriate mechanism to ensure these things happen is to build on the functions of the Mental Health Commission.</P>
      <P>The role of the tribunal is to review an individual's case and to decide whether he or she is mentally disordered. This is an onerous task and it would not be appropriate, therefore, for the tribunal to make an assessment of the standards of care in hospitals. This task probably fits better into the role of the commission, which is why the Minister's amendment has been tabled. That amendment will allow the Mental Health Commission to attach conditions to the registration of approved centres.</P>
      <P>Included among these conditions are specifications relating to the number of staff required to be employed in a centre and to carrying out essential maintenance and refurbishment of a centre. The commission may also require the introduction or review of policies, protocols or procedures relating to the ordering, prescribing, storing and administration of medicines.</P>
      <P>In each case where a condition is attached to the registration of a centre, the practical effect would be that the registered proprietor would have three years to ensure that these improvements were made before the centre would be due for registration again. If a further application were made for registration and the commission were to find that these conditions had not been adhered to, the re-registration of the approved centre concerned could be refused by the commission in accordance with section 63(5)(<i>b</i>)(iv). Vesting this function in the Mental Health Commission will ensure these matters will be monitored, supervised and overseen on a continuing basis. This is a more effective means of ensuring that adequate standards are in place than the avenues proposed by the Opposition amendments.</P>
      <P>Regarding what Deputy Neville said, he should accept that the policy of the Department for a number of years has been that people with an intellectual disability should not be admitted to a psychiatric hospital unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder.</P>

      <P>It is a bit disingenuous of the Minister of State to link directly the work of the commission and the accreditation of centres and the work of the tribunal which, as she said, focuses on individual cases and circumstances. Registration and accreditation are separate issues to the issue I raise. A centre may well be accredited and may not be of poor standard but simply may not be able to provide for an individual in a satisfactory way. The tribunal will be barred from considering that aspect of an individual case because there is no provision in law for it to do so. The tribunal may look at the legal aspects of a case but it cannot decide if a particular institution is the appropriate place to care for the individual concerned. That is a major negative aspect of the work of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There are many examples of inappropriate placements. There are still people with intellectual disabilities in psychiatric centres. Many people who suffer from alcoholism are in psychiatric institutions because there is no other place for them. I am not clear what will happen to these peple when this Bill becomes law. This legislation will create a difficulty for such people who in the past could at least be admitted to a psychiatric institution and be looked after at some level. However, that is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>I am talking about a person who may be in a centre which is perfectly well accredited and registered but which cannot deal with the person's disorder. This issue has not been addressed by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The tribunal is there to decide whether a person is suffering from a mental disorder. It is a quasi-judicial body as set out by our international law obligations and its concerns, therefore, are with the protection of the patient's civil rights. It will determine whether a person has a mental disorder and whether he or she is being detained correctly. It is not established with a view to examining the adequacy of the conditions in which a person is accommodated. That is the role for the commission. This is why we are suggesting strengthening the role of the commission in the reviews of protocols, procedures and so on.</P>

      <P>In page 18, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) In the event of an appeal, the hospital, health board or psychiatrist concerned may be required, at the discretion of the court, to satisfy the court that the patient suffers with a mental disorder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When there is an appeal to the Circuit Court the onus is on the patient to prove he or she is not suffering from a mental disorder. The onus is not on the hospital, the health board or the psychiatrist to establish that the patient was involuntarily admitted and has a mental disorder. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in the event of an appeal the hospital, health board or psychiatrist concerned may be required, at the discretion of the court, to satisfy the court that the patient suffers from a mental disorder.</P>
      <P>One could say a person with a mental disorder is being asked to disprove his or her guilt. Why should the onus be on a patient to prove to a court that he or she does not have a mental disorder? The onus should be on the professionals who have examined the patient and diagnosed a mental disorder to prove that diagnosis. Why should a psychiatrist and health board simply assert that a person has a mental disorder and oblige the patient to prove he or she does not? This amendment would place the onus on the professionals, where it ought to be. We must challenge the professionals in the psychiatric services at every opportunity to ensure they are properly performing their duties with the maximum efficiency and are careful when making decisions about the mental health of people in their care.</P>
      <P>There are circumstances in which people must be involuntarily admitted into mental institutions. However, when a patient challenges such an admission in court the health professionals should prove their diagnosis in court. The patient should not be treated like a prisoner in the dock and obliged to prove he or she is not mentally disordered in the face of testimony by a group of professionals with excellent back-up. The Minister may say a person in such circumstances may have the benefit of the services of a consultant psychiatrist on his or her side. If a person is deemed to be ineligible for a medical card must he or she be obliged to employ, not only lawyers but also psychiatrists to prove he or she is not mentally ill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> The onus of proving a person is mentally ill should be shifted from the individual back to the professionals.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neville's amendment is concerned with the balance the Circuit Court must apply in hearing an appeal by an individual or patient against a decision of the tribunal. As the Bill is based on the principle that the decision as to mental disorder is a medical one, it is therefore the tribunal which has the function of review and appeal of the decision. An appeal to the Circuit Court is not a full appeal in the ordinary sense but rather a new statutory mechanism to challenge the substance of the decision on mental disorder.</P>
      <P>The position under the Bill is that when that decision is appealed to the Circuit Court the validity of the original order stands unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court that the original order was wrong. This, I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General, is the correct balance in this additional appeal mechanism being provided in the Bill. It gives an individual the means to overturn a wrong decision while, at the same time, giving due weight to the decision of the tribunal. This does not mean the authorities will not have to defend the tribunal decision. The authorities will have to satisfy the court with their answers to the challenges made by the individual concerned. What the present provision means is that after hearing all the evidence the court will uphold the original decision unless it is satisfied that the individual is not suffering from a mental disorder.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Neville would have the effect of having the issue reheard in its entirety. It would allow the courts to commence an investigation of the kind already carried out by the tribunal which is one best made by the medical professionals concerned. This mechanism for appeal is, of course, in addition to <i>habeas corpus.</i></P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and I accept everything she says. The amendment asks that the outcome of the commission's examination of a case be presented to the court as proof that the person has a mental illness. The onus should not be on a patient who does not feel he or she has a mental illness and wants to challenge the diagnosis to obtain the necessary evidence and to prove that he or she is not mentally ill, while the professionals in the case are simply required to assert that the patient is mentally ill and are not expected to support their diagnosis. The balance should be on the side of the patient who is the vulnerable person in an involuntary admission to a psychiatric institution. The purpose of the Bill is to protect them. The amendment would provide an added protection in court in that the patient would be in a position to query or challenge all aspects of the decision which confined them in a mental institution against their will.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(16) No appeal shall lie against an order of the Circuit Court under this section other than an appeal on a point of law to the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus's amendment proposes to delete the provision that the decision of the Circuit Court, on an appeal under the section, shall be final and conclusive. Its effect would be that a person could appeal the decision of the Circuit Court to the higher courts. I do not propose to accept it. The principle running through the Bill and the reason the issue of mental disorder is directed to an expert tribunal rather than the courts is that the assessment of mental disorder is a matter for medical expertise. The limitation on the appeal applies to the substantive medical issue only. Any question as to the procedures used by the tribunal in reaching its decision can be raised in judicial review and the Bill does not introduce any limitation to such proceedings. Similarly any question as to the detention of a patient may be raised in <i>habeus corpus</i>, itself a constitutional remedy. The limitation is confined to the substantive issue which, as indicated above, is a medical decision and already subject to a full review by the tribunal. Given the concerns raised, however, the Minister is proposing to allow an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>

      <P>In page 25, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In deciding whether and when to discharge a patient under this section, the consultant psychiatrist responsible for his or her care and treatment shall have regard to the need to ensure:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) that the patient is not inappropriately discharged, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) that the patient is detained pursuant to an admission order or a renewal order only for so long as is reasonably necessary for his or her proper care and treatment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand during the debate on Committee Stage concern was expressed about the discharge of patients and, in particular, two distinct but related issues: first, the fear that a patient would be inappropriately discharged without having received adequate care and attention for the mental illness for which he or she was being treated; and, second, the concern that a patient would be detained under an involuntary detention order for longer than was absolutely necessary. The Minister's amendment, modelled on that originally tabled by Deputy McManus on Committee Stage, is designed to ensure consultants will consider these two points before making <Col N="1452" /> an order to discharge a patient from involuntary detention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw my amendment in deference to the one in the name of the Minister which deals with my concerns. Obviously, clinicians do not like to be advised how to do their work or about the judgments they make but it is important that there should be some framework and guidance within the Bill to ensure when they are making clinical decisions they do so in the spirit of the protection of rights in the Bill which include not only the right not to have an unnecessarily extended period in an institution but also the right to access care and treatment. There was a danger this issue might not have been fully considered were it not for the fact that I raised it on Committee Stage and the Minister accepted it. I support the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Minister's amendment. If the Bill has the capacity to do so, this provision should also be extended to those in hospital on a voluntary basis. The matter reverts to one of the issues I raised this morning concerning those at high risk of suicide being discharged from mental institutions inappropriately despite the extreme concerns of their families. This is occurring and such people are in danger of dying by suicide. If it is inappropriate to discharge somebody likely to commit murder or seriously injure another person, surely it is also inappropriate to discharge somebody likely to injure or kill himself or herself.</P>
      <P>There is a view that, at a certain stage, if a person is determined to die by suicide, there is no more to be done. We should, however, have the same safeguards in place in our institutions to protect the public against violence by somebody who is mentally ill as for somebody who is likely to inflict injury upon himself or herself. There are double standards about this but the situation is very clear; such people should be protected because every life is precious. Nobody ever has the right to take his or her own life and no one has the right to facilitate him or her in so doing, which is another debate.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister's amendment, perhaps the Department could examine both areas, those admitted voluntarily and those admitted involuntarily. There is a serious question mark against the cases of many in mental institutions for social rather than medical reasons. I know many suffer from depression because of their life circumstances and that in other situations they would never have a mental illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a protracted debate on the issue. To some extent we are moving away from the past and it would be incorrect to say that conditions are like those of 20, 30 or 40 years ago. We must ensure, however, our psychiatric institutions are never again used for dealing with social issues, whether within a family or otherwise, or broader issues arising from social difficulties. <Col N="1453" /> Social deviance or problems resulting from social circumstances should not be dealt with by putting people in mental institutions. The Minister of State will say they were admitted voluntarily but they did not know any better. They were told to enter an institution in some cases and were left there for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 25, line 12, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and his or her legal representative&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When commenting on the length of time allowed under the legislation for involuntary admission, many people expressed concern that a great number of patients are discharged before the period had elapsed. It is estimated approximately 40% of patients are discharged before the 21 days have elapsed. A provision was inserted in section 27 to address that concern whereby a patient who is discharged is given a notice that he or she is entitled to have his or her detention reviewed by a tribunal even though he or she has been discharged. To initiate this review, he or she must indicate in writing to the commission within 14 days that he or she wishes the review to continue.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed is a further safeguard to ensure patients are aware of their rights to have their cases reviewed. The amendment provides that the notice given to the patient under section 27(2) is also given to his or her legal representative. The expectation is that the legal representative would advise the patient as to the necessity of applying in writing within 14 days if he or she wished his or her detention to be reviewed. This is a positive change to the section and a further safeguard of the patient's right to a review.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 25, line 24, after &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, where appropriate, the relevant health board and housing authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a decision is made to discharge a patient the consultant psychiatrist will cause a copy of the order to be made and notice to be given to the commission. The amendment proposes that where appropriate the notice would also be sent to the relevant health board and local authority. I appreciate there are issues relating to confidentiality and protection of patients' interests but I am also conscious that the system is fragmented in terms of support for the psychiatrically ill. When they are in an institution, the system works, not always wonderfully, but it has clarity. It is not clear what happens when patients are discharged from that structured framework into a community where nobody is considered to be responsible for them. If they do not have immediate family, they may end up in a vulnerable position, particularly, for example, when there is a grave <Col N="1454" /> housing crisis and health boards do not have the resources and staff that are needed.</P>
    <P>However, it is important there is some link built in where appropriate, to ensure there is ongoing knowledge of and support for an individual who has been discharged. I will cite one example. An individual who was clearly suffering quite serious psychiatric illness was discharged from an institution. He embarked on some eccentric behaviour in his neighbourhood. When people found they were receiving a great deal of unwanted attention from this individual, who was obviously deluded through no fault of his own, there did not seem to be any way for those affected by the man's behaviour to contact somebody who was aware of his case and was able to take action and deal with the issue in an acceptable way. For a long time, the Garda and housing authorities were being called and nobody was willing to take any responsibility or displayed any great interest in the case.</P>
    <P>As Ireland becomes more urbanised and the links between people continue to break it is important that the agencies that have a certain statutory obligation are kept informed about these individuals to ensure where appropriate their support can be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I refer to mentally ill people who are homeless. There is a problem regarding the discharge of psychiatric patients who are homeless. There is a high prevalence of mental illness among the homeless. Sometimes they are homeless because of their illness and <i>vice versa</i>. There is an inadequate number of hostels available to take off the streets, homeless people who receive treatment in a mental institution and are then discharged. They should not be discharged on to the street. They should be kept in hospital for a minimum period of three to six months and they should receive psychiatric assistance. I appreciate moves have been made in this area in recent times. The Minister recently outlined developments in that area in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled. However, senior psychiatrists have expressed concern about the treatment of the mentally ill who are homeless following discharge from mental institutions, whether it is voluntary discharge or otherwise.</P>
      <P>There should be structures in place in every health board area, if not every county, because people want to reside in their own communities. There is a homelessness problem in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and elsewhere and there is a mental health problem among the homeless as a result of drug and alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, depression and so on. Some homeless people are subject to deep depression because of their circumstances. Homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse and so on are interlinked. Special treatment should be provided following discharge from a mental institution whereby patients would receive full support and could return to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The amendment goes a long way towards providing for that. If a homeless person has been discharged and the local authority is contacted and made aware of that, a certain onus is put on the local authority to provide accommodation for the individual. That is a start but we should go further. There should be a programme of post-discharge care for mentally ill patients who were homeless prior to admission to an institution so that they do not return to the same circumstances and end up in a cycle of homelessness and admissions to psychiatric institutions. There should be a great deal of investment to ensure that cycle is broken.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about people being discharged into inappropriate circumstances, particularly the homeless, because there is a great deal of evidence that many homeless people were discharged following a long stay in an institution. Deputies will be aware of the mental health programme for homeless people, particularly in the eastern area, with the residential and day facilities and the outreach programme. There is also the Government strategy on homelessness, which is an inter-agency, interdepartmental approach, and because Deputy McManus's amendment fits in very well with that I am happy to accept the amendment. People leaving institutional care is a particular problem.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 25, line 42, to delete &ldquo;detained.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;detained:</P>
      <P>Provided that a person suffering from such a disorder shall not be admitted voluntarily to an approved centre, or remain at such centre after he or she has ceased to be liable to be detained under this Act, unless the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of that patient is satisfied that the patient is competent to make a free and informed decision as to his or her voluntary admission to, or remaining in, that centre.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I proposed on Committee Stage that there would be an additional amendment and that the wording beyond &ldquo;detained&rdquo; would include a protection for people who were involuntarily detained in a centre and who stayed on as voluntary patients when their period of involuntary detention had expired, I felt it was important that the psychiatrist assessing them was satisfied that they were in a position to make that decision, that they were truly voluntary patients. I felt this matter needed to be addressed in the Bill because people who are involuntary patients under the Bill have certain safeguards and protections <Col N="1456" /> which the voluntary patient does not have. It was really a question of providing the guidance for the consultant psychiatrist, the check list, to make sure that when he or she was assessing the capability of the patient to make that decision, that it was being properly done because otherwise pressure could be put on a patient who was not in a position to be confident to make that free and informed decision.</P>
    <P>I looked at the list of amendments to see if the Government had put forward a similar amendment because when I raised this matter on Committee Stage, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept this amendment as I agree with the principle behind it regarding the concerns of perhaps some voluntary patients within the system who are not, in reality, voluntary. However, I would be reluctant to accept the amendment as presented here without having it examined by legal experts. The Deputy will be aware by this stage that the Bill is an extremely complex provision and we must ensure that every section in it means exactly what we want it to mean. We do not want, for example, to leave out any particular category of patient. However, I am amenable to accepting this amendment on principle and we will return to the Deputy with the correct wording on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said and that is what I took him to mean and unless I am missing something, he has not lived up to his promise.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister meant at the time he said it, and he expressed his sympathy with the principle of the amendment but he also said that he could not accept it without having it examined by the legal experts. Unfortunately, the legal advice now available suggests that the amendment is not appropriate to the Bill and I will explain briefly the reason behind that.</P>
      <P>The clear implication behind this amendment is that some patients who are legally classified as voluntary are not in hospital of their own free will, and I am advised that it is unwise to make an amendment based on such a premise. A voluntary patient should be there voluntarily, and that is what the term should mean. If a person is not a voluntary patient, he should be subject to an admission order. I acknowledge that there are concerns in some quarters that some so-called voluntary patients may not be in hospital on a strictly voluntary basis. However, the appropriate mechanism for dealing with that issue will be through the Mental Health Commission, which has, as one of its functions, &ldquo;the promotion of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services&rdquo;. The annual inspections of the Inspector of Mental Health Services would also play a role in monitoring this issue. On the advice of the legal experts, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but that reply sounds quite daft. It is saying that the amendment might make some implication that some voluntary patients are being held as involuntary patients. That is not what the amendment is saying. It is saying that when the consultant psychiatrist makes a decision, when there is this transition in the status of the patient from the involuntary to the voluntary, he or she is absolutely certain that that transition is being made and he has satisfied himself that the patient is able to make that informed choice because the patient will lose rights by becoming a voluntary patient. That is a feature about which we are very concerned in the Bill. We are doing various things to make sure that involuntary patients are given their rights. That does not necessarily imply that there are many involuntary patients in institutions who are being denied their rights. Perhaps they are, but it has nothing to do with the creation and delivery of this Bill. In the same way, this amendment is about ensuring that when that transition is made, the consultant psychiatrist satisfies himself or herself about the status of that patient. That does not have implications for anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. I can quote many examples from the past where involuntary patients were committed to mental institutions but their families walked away from them and they became voluntary without their knowing it, and 40 years afterwards they were still patients. I know of these cases and the Minister of State knows of them, and we must protect against that happening in the future. Society has a responsibility to somebody who has been committed voluntarily or involuntarily to a hospital to ensure that they get maximum treatment and that they are discharged at the earliest possible time into the communities. No extraneous issues should affect that. Families who have responsibilities should be forced to face up to those responsibilities and if they do not, the State has an onus to carry out its duties in that area. We should only have people in our mental institutions who are seriously mentally ill and who are not in a position to exist outside of that institution. Hospitals are places where ill people go to be cured, not to be institutionalised. In the past we have seen too many examples of involuntarily patients becoming voluntary and still being patients in the hospital years later. This amendment puts an onus on the institution to fully examine all aspects of the case, discuss it with the patient concerned and ensure that the proper decision is made with regard to remaining in the institution or being discharged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>To respond to Deputy Neville's point first, he talked about people being insti<Col N="1458" /> tutionalised for so long but it is wise to examine the numbers and to see how the de-institutionalisation process has developed over the past 15 years. I know Deputy Neville is well aware of that. In 1983, there were 12,802 in-patients but that figure has now decreased to 4,768 because of the progress made in community services, etc., which I accept is the right way to proceed.</P>
      <P>On Deputy McManus's amendment, I can see from the legal perspective why it would be dangerous to presume that a voluntary patient is not in hospital voluntarily but she is saying that the consultant psychiatrist would adhere to good practice when admitting voluntary patients. This is why we feel the role would be best reserved for the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to accept that this issue needs to be referred to a commission. I would have thought the commission would have enough to do without dealing with what is a simple safeguard inserted in the Bill regarding a consultant psychiatrist, who is the person making important judgments concerning a sick person. The amendment proposes that when such a sick person has completed his or her period as an involuntary patient, and there is a question as to whether he or she will continue as a voluntary patient, the consultant psychiatrist has to be satisfied that the decision is being made by the patient in an informed and free manner.</P>
      <P>This does not imply anything about anyone. However, it places a certain obligation on the consultant psychiatrist. I challenge the legal adviser's recommendation to exclude this provision as it suggests that, in effect, the Minister of State is saying a consultant psychiatrist does not have to be satisfied that the patient is competent to make a free and informed decision. I do not think that is what the Minister of State is saying as we all wish the consultant psychiatrist to be satisfied in this regard. However, we know that consultants are not infallible.</P>
      <P>An important case is taking place surrounding the practice of a consultant in a general hospital which led to great trauma and the mutilation of women over 20 years which was never addressed until two young nurses decided to blow the whistle and were brave enough to stand up to the power of the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear. We do not have a proper medical practitioners' Act and we are not going to have one for quite some time. The idea that psychiatrists will always make the right decision, without any reference to legislation, is foolish and erroneous. I have the highest regard for the medical profession and I would not denigrate the work of its members. However, the idea that we cannot require a consultant psychiatrist to employ good practice by way of this Bill, because that implies that people are incarcerated against their will, does not add up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> If there was such an inherent implication we should not discuss the Bill at all. If that was the case we should not discuss a review system as that implies that there are involuntary patients who may be incarcerated incorrectly. If that is the logic of this advice then the entire Bill involves such an implication. If that is the case then why do we need a commission, a tribunal or a review period? All of these things are being put in place as safeguards. If they all have implications then, perhaps, we should go back to the beginning and start discussing the legal advice, or even seek further legal advice.</P>
    <P>If that is not the case then why is this issue arising in the context of this, relatively harmless, amendment? The amendment is so harmless that the Minister did not need any convincing. I asked him for his opinion. I did not even give him my opinion. We were approaching the end of the debate but he was willing to offer his view that this was a reasonable amendment which did not involve any implications. He just had to examine it as we did not wish to leave out any category of patient.</P>
    <P>I find it remarkably inconsistent that this is now an issue in the context of an amendment when the entire Bill could set up implications about the manner in which we dealt with involuntary patients over the years. Perhaps we should discuss that issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 25, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.&ndash;(1) Where the Inspector of Mental Health Services is satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists that a mentally impaired person was abused, exploited or neglected, or is at risk of being abused, exploited or neglected, he or she may initiate a Circuit Court application seeking the court's approval to the placement of that person in the care of a relative, health board or voluntary agency as the court may direct as being necessary or desirable for the protection of such person.</P>
      <P>(2) The Commission shall, within 6 months of its formation, publish guidelines to assist the Inspector of Mental Health Services in this regard.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to give the inspector of mental services the power, where he or she is satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists that a mentally impaired person was abused, exploited or neglected, or is at risk of being abused, exploited or neglected, to initiate a Circuit Court application seeking the court's approval for the placement of that person in the care of a relative, <Col N="1460" /> health board or voluntary agency, as the court may direct as being necessary or desirable for the protection of such a person. The amendment also proposes that the commission shall, within six months of its formation, publish guidelines to assist the Inspector of Mental Health Services in this regard.</P>
    <P>The amendment will allow the Inspector of Mental Health Services to apply to the court where a person has been abused, exploited or neglected, or where he or she suspects that the person is at such risk, to place that person beyond exploitation, neglect or abuse and in the care of a person nominated by the court for the protection of the patient.</P>
    <P>The amendment also caters for the publishing of guidelines to assist the Inspector of Mental Health Services in this regard. It also seeks to provide that the commission will publish these guidelines within six months of its formation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper published in 1995 envisaged that adult care orders would be introduced as part of the new legislation. The intention was that, where a person suffering from a mental disorder had been, or was at risk of becoming the victim of abuse, neglect or exploitation, a court order could be made to place such a person in the care of a relative, health board or voluntary agency. It was felt that adult care orders could be used primarily for persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged during debate on Second Stage, that the provision of adult care orders was not being included in the Bill. He also made the point that the issue was not being overlooked or forgotten, and that it would be given further consideration once the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons it was decided not to provide for adult care orders in the new legislation. First, the primary focus of this Bill is to bring Irish mental health legislation into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to establish a mental health commission to ensure high standards in the provision of mental health services.</P>
      <P>Second, there is considerable debate among professional psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and social workers as to how such orders could, and should, work. In Britain, the experience of adult care orders has been mixed. There are fears that where such orders empower health boards to impose compulsory treatment, this results in patients avoiding contact with services and, therefore, becoming homeless. The carer-client relationship between mental health professionals and their clients may be seriously damaged as a result. Even relationships between patients and voluntary organisations may be damaged where a voluntary organisation is named in the court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of compulsory treatment associated with adult care orders is repugnant to many. In Britain, concerns have been expressed by <Col N="1461" /> social workers and service users about the degree of medical power associated with such orders. There have also been suggestions that service providers may experience pressure to use such orders inappropriately.</P>
    <P>The care and protection of vulnerable people is important. However, it is essential that any measures put in place should respect the rights of service users and improve their quality of life. It is not clear at this stage that providing for adult care orders would contribute to this objective.</P>
    <P>I would like to see further research on the experience of adult care orders in other jurisdictions and further consultations between officials and representatives of the psychiatric professions and service user bodies before proposals on this issue are brought forward.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

I am not casting aspersions on the mental health services but there should be a procedure to allow the inspector of mental health services initiate a court application for protection for the person, where he sees a <i>prima facie</i> case that a person was abused, exploited or neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not see fit to deal with this issue now. It is important that it is dealt with under this Bill. I am also concerned about matters which have been raised with me in certain parts of the country. I will not be specific because I have no wish to imply that there is a problem in or abuse by any institution. I do not have proof and Members of the House should not use privilege to bandy accusations about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am concerned that I cannot obtain information on clinical trials in psychiatric institutions prior to 1997, when the Irish Medicines <Col N="1462" /> Board was involved in such trials. According to information I received from the Minister, 53 clinical trials were conducted in the past three years in mental institutions. Last December, I asked the Minister the number of clinical trials approved from 1968 to 1997. He informed me that he had asked the Irish Medicines Board to commence an examination of this issue and to let him have the information I requested as early as possible. He said he would forward the information to me. I have not received that information. When one is promised information but does not receive it, one begins to worry and ask questions. I am seeking statistical information on the number of clinical trials in a 20 year period but I have not received it, despite the Minister's promise in this House on 30 January.</P>
    <P>I received another letter in relation to this matter from the Minister in January. It related to trials during the years 1998 to 2000, inclusive. I had requested the names of psychiatric institutions in which clinical trials were conducted in the past. I received the information relating to the years 1998 to 2000 but no information for the years prior to that. The Minister informed me that he had written to individual companies seeking more detailed data regarding the current status of the trials and, in particular, the patients recruited and withdrawn and other measures taken by the companies. He said he would forward the documentation to me as soon as he received it. That was in January but I have not yet received that information.</P>
    <P>I cannot get information on clinical trials on psychiatric patients even though people tell me it is an issue I should take up, that it should be examined in great detail and that things happened in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which should be examined. The Minister will ask me to give an example but I cannot do that. However, I have asked a question to which I have not received a reply so one can understand my concern that there is a reason for not giving me even statistical information.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to deal with the issue of consultation for the completion of clinical trials on patients and the administration of drugs, and what protections had existed over the decades to ensure the trials on psychiatric patients were carried out with full information being communicated to the patient so people knew exactly what was happening and voluntarily responded to it. There is anecdotal evidence to the effect that hospital nurses who were administering the trials got so concerned that they refused to do it but the consultants continued the trials. I have received such information from, in some cases, people who worked in these institutions and, in other cases, from relatives of patients who are concerned about what happened in those institutions.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if we could get full information on what happened through the decades. I am not inferring there was something wrong but I want that information. Given that it has been <Col N="1463" /> denied to me for almost six months, I must ask why that is the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 25, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.&ndash;the Minister shall, within 6 months of this Act becoming law, lay before the Oireachtas regulations, similar in effect to rules of court, which shall provide for simple and practicable procedures for dealing with elderly persons who are mentally impaired for the sole purpose of protecting the interests of such persons. Such regulations shall not take effect if a motion is passed by either House of the Oireachtas rescinding the regulations within 90 days of the regulations being published.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment will provide for simple and practicable procedures for dealing with elderly persons who are mentally impaired. In a court ruling 12 years ago, the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay stated that it was desirable that consideration be given to the introduction of rules of court appropriate to simple and practicable procedures for dealing with elderly persons alleged to be of unsound mind, where the person alone requires protection. He was highlighting the fact that the wards of court procedure was not suitable for cases where the personal welfare alone of the person with mental disability required protection.</P>
      <P>John Costelloe of Eugene F. Collins and Company, solicitors, and a council member of the Law Society of Ireland stated in an article that he had come across a number of tragic family situations where the absence of a suitable legal procedure had caused enormous stress. He went on to state that wardship legislation in Ireland is more than 125 years old and is in urgent need of reform in certain areas. To meet the concern expressed by the Chief Justice, I propose that the new section would give the Minister power within six months of the enactment of this legislation to lay before the Oireachtas regulations, similar in effect to the rules of court, which would provide for simple and practical procedures for dealing with elderly people who are mentally impaired, for the sole purpose of protecting the interests of such people. Such regulations &ldquo;shall not take effect if a motion is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas rescinding the regulations within 90 days of the regulations being published&rdquo;.  The Minister must satisfy both Houses of the Oireachtas that the regulations are simple, practicable and achieve the amendment's objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concern expressed by the Minister in regard to respecting the rights of service users. This amendment proposes that the mental health services must be satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists where a person has been abused, exploited or <Col N="1464" /> neglected. The courts would have to be satisfied in that case. The Government White Paper on the Mental Health Bill recommended that where a mentally impaired person is abused or neglected, an authorised health board official could initiate an application seeking court approval for the person's placement in the care of a relative, health board or voluntary agency.</P>

      <P>The membership of the Mental Health Commission has been a topic of some considerable debate since the Bill's publication. Having considered all of the views expressed on Committee Stage, and in the media by the various interested parties, the Minister has decided to increase the commission's membership from ten to 13. The three proposed additional members would comprise an additional consultant psychiatrist, an additional representative of people who suffer from mental illness &ndash; a service user &ndash; and a representative of the health board chief executives. These additional representatives will add to the weight of expertise within the commission and will ensure it can do its work efficiently and effectively. I hope Deputies McManus and Neville will appreciate the need to keep the commission's membership to a reasonable size while accommodating the various interests involved to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all agreed that it is a very important step forward for patients and service users to have a voice in the formulation of policy and the oversight of mental health services. However, it would be anomalous in these circumstances to retain in the Bill a provision which allows the Minister to remove a commission member who becomes incapable, through ill health, of carrying out his or her duties. If we are to provide that a person suffering from mental illness may become a member of the commission, it does not make sense to retain a provision which would allow the Minister to remove a commission member for the very reason which led to his or her appointment <Col N="1465" /> in the first instance. Accordingly, amendment No. 41 proposes the deletion of &ldquo;through ill health&rdquo; from section 35.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes that two representatives of registered medical practitioners who will serve on the commission should each have experience of the provision of mental health services through Irish and English. Ba bhreá liom go b'fhéadfadh gach duine labhairt i nGaeilge agus a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge. While it is important that equal recognition be accorded to Irish and English, the proposed amendment would severely restrict the Minister in making appointments. Not only would he be required to find doctors and consultant psychiatrists who could speak Irish, they would also be required to have practised through the medium of Irish. I suspect it would prove particularly difficult to find such people. A more important way of providing recognition in this area is to ensure that State services are made available to people for whom Irish is their first language. Tá a lán dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ar seo. The proposed amendment would prove totally impractical in the circumstances.</P>

    <P>I referred to this amendment earlier during the discussion on the timescale for a person's admission and review. This amendment requires that the Mental Health Commission reports to the Minister within 18 months of the commencement of Part 2 on how the process of involuntary admission and review is working.

As I stated earlier, this amendment will ensure the operation of this part of the Bill is reviewed within a relatively short period of its <Col N="1467" /> commencement and that the Minister will be made aware of any adjustments or improvements to the process which may be deemed necessary in the light of the commission's experience.</P>

      <P>The Minister has received many representations on the membership of tribunals since the Bill's publication. The Bill, as initiated, provided for a one member tribunal comprising a consultant psychiatrist who would sit with a lawyer. Many people suggested the tribunal should also include a lay representative and the Minister and I concur with that proposal. These amendments provide that a tribunal will comprise three members &ndash; a consultant psychiatrist, a practising barrister or solicitor and a lay person. The amendments further provide that the barrister or solicitor would be the tribunal chairperson and that each question would be determined by a majority of the votes of the members.</P>
      <P>The third amendment refers to the consultant psychiatrist on the tribunal and is designed to allow the medical health commission to have access to the expertise of retired consultant psychiatrists.

      <P>I understand the Minister signalled his intention to table this amendment during the Committee Stage debate. It arises from representations made to him by the Law Society of Ireland which noted that while privilege was granted in the Bill to witnesses before a tribunal, a similar privilege was not granted to legal representatives. We would all agree it is important that a patient's legal representative would feel free to say whatever he or she felt was necessary to make his or her patient's case before a tribunal. Accordingly, the amendment grants legal representatives appearing before the tribunal the same privileges and immunities they would enjoy if they were appearing in a court case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" />&ldquo;56.&ndash;(1) The consent of a patient shall be required for treatment except where, in the opinion of the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient, the treatment is necessary to safeguard the life of the patient, to restore his or her health, to alleviate his or her condition, or to relieve his or her suffering, and by reason of his or her mental disorder the patient concerned is incapable of giving such consent.</P>
    <P>(2) This section shall not apply to the treatment specified in <i>section 57, 58</i> or <i>59</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to improve the wording of section 56, which deals with treatment not requiring consent. While the general thrust of the amendment was agreed, some concerns were expressed about the wording and the Minister undertook to re-examine it for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>This amendment dispenses with the term &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; and employs a form of words that arises from the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987. It provides that the consent of a patient shall always be required for treatment except where, in the opinion of the consultant psychiatrist, the treatment is necessary to safeguard the life of the patient, to restore his or her health, to alleviate his or her condition or to relieve his or her suffering. This is a more satisfactory wording than the term &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; employed in the amendment tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The second term which caused concern on Committee Stage was the concept of a patient being &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; to give consent. Following clarification with the medical experts, it was found that the term &ldquo;incapable by reason of their mental disorder&rdquo; encompassed more precisely what was intended. In each case, it would be at the discretion of the consultant psychiatrist to decide on the patient's capability or otherwise. I hope the Deputies find that this amendment more accurately deals with the concerns they raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted it has been improved, but did the legal advice the Minister received point out the implication that there may have been cases where consultants prescribed treatment without the permission of a patient who was capable of giving it?

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 50, after line 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;74.&ndash;The Minister shall, not later than 5 years after the establishment day, carry out a review of the operation of this Act and shall make a report to each House of the Oireachtas of his or her findings and conclusions resulting from the review.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the provisions of this legislation will hold considerable logistical challenges for the new Mental Health Commission. It is appropriate for the House to revisit the entire scope of this Act in a matter of years to review how it is operating and to make any changes necessary. This amendment, therefore, provides that the Minister shall, not later than five years after the establishment of the Mental Health Commission, carry out a review of the operation of the Act as a whole and report back to the Oireachtas on his or her findings and conclusions. I envisage that contentious issues, such as the time scale required for initial involuntary detention and the appropriateness of the work of the tribunals, could be revisited on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that there is to be a five year gap before the operation of the Act will be reviewed. However, while five years appears to be a lengthy time period I welcome the provision allowing for a review and thank the Minister for introducing it. It is a pity previous mental health legislation did not contain similar provisions.</P>

      <P>In too much legislation ministerial orders are never implemented. All sections of this legislation will only come into effect following ministerial order. I inquired how many sections of Acts were not brought into law by ministerial order but it was not possible to submit a reply because of the number of sections not brought into force despite the wish of the Oireachtas to do so. This amendment will have two effects. First, there will be a review of all aspects of the legislation within five years. Second, it will ensure that sections will be implemented by ministerial order, otherwise the Minister will have to explain why not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville and Deputy McManus for their contribution to the debate and for their work on Committee Stage. We all recognise this is major legislation. It replaces the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and brings our law into line with our international obligations. The co-operation and interest of the House has been very evident in this. I also thank the officials from my Department for their enormous work on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House and I add my thanks to the officials involved, including those who drafted it, those who worked on improving it and those who researched the areas involved. The Bill deals with involuntary admission to psychiatric institutions, which is a very big step to be taken against anybody. It is a serious step to involuntarily confine somebody who has committed a crime. These people are ill but they are a danger to themselves or to society. There is no choice on what has to be done.</P>
      <P>Mental illness is a very sad, upsetting and traumatic event in a person's life and in a family. I ask the Minister to introduce a mental health Bill dealing with all aspects of the voluntary sector. That would have an impact on the involuntary sector. This area has not been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I make no excuses for repeating myself on this issue. The area of mental health and illness has not been addressed because there is no demand. A taboo and stigma still surrounds mental illness. As a result our constituents do not lobby us to do something about it. When there is mental illness in a family people often stay quiet. They do not demand services because of the stigma attaching to the illness and the reluctance to deal with it. I hope that is ending and every encouragement should be made to ensure this. The State has a duty to identify the issues involved. While we may not be under pressure to act, we are under a deep obligation as legislators to examine this area and introduce legislation to cover the legal, servicing and funding aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her attention. It is difficult to take a Bill such as this when it not in her specific area of responsibility. She did an excellent job. I also thank the civil servants who have been involved in the Bill. It has been a slow process and I became impatient about its enactment. It is welcome that we have reached this point. It is a better Bill for the time and effort that was put into considering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> People who are psychiatrically ill have waited a long time for this legislation. The issue has often been hidden and ignored in the political decision-making process. This legislation is, therefore, a step forward. I also thank the legal advisers, although I do not necessarily agree with them.</P>

    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;&ndash;commends the Government for the unprecedented increases in health funding which it has </P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;been implementing since 1997;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises that this funding has led to significant improvements in a range of important services; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;endorses the process which has been adopted to facilitate the development of a new health strategy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <P>Mr. McCormack: I wish to share time with Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The health service is in a shambles and, despite the Minister's claim of increased expenditure in the health budget, everybody can see that services for patients are getting worse. I cite as an example UCHG. Why has the Minister failed to deal with the hard questions? Why does he not ask how an increased budget is being eaten up while the health service worsens every week? Can he not acknowledge that each year more and more of the budget goes on layers of administration? There are chief executives, managers, programme managers and a full-time office dealing with complaints from patients and their families. The services of cleaning staff have been dispensed with and contract cleaners hired. Does the Minister not ask the hard question as to whether the standard of hygiene has improved at hospitals as a result? It certainly has not improved at UCHG. Can the Minister tell me how many patients have to be readmitted, or have their stay extended, because of cross-infection while in hospital? When the health boards took over from the county councils it took six to replace every one then employed. How many times greater is the number in administration now?</P>
    <P>More than a year and a half ago the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahy, announced that the Department had ordered a report on management at UCHG, but despite my efforts I cannot find out where it is. Did it ever see the light of day or was the then Minister of State bluffing? Can the Minister for Health and Children, <Col N="1479" /> Deputy Martin, tell me where the report is? I can tell him that matters are serious at UCHG. While everybody has praise for the doctors and nurses, I could outline cases of patients being on trolleys for up to 36 hours, with 24 hours being commonplace. The longest waiting time on the list is now ten years. Only a few months ago a woman came to my clinic very distressed at receiving a letter from UCHG calling her relative for an appointment, though the person concerned had been dead for seven years. It is a fact and was reported in the local newspaper. Another man came to my clinic who was due to attend for chemotherapy. He was told to ring on the morning he was to attend and on doing so was told there was no bed available. He rang twice a day for 11 days before being called for treatment.</P>
    <P>In the case of the appointment of a second consultant neurologist at UCHG the Minister tells me in replies to parliamentary questions that the post was sanctioned in January 2000. Interviews have only recently taken place, more than a year and a half later. The red tape involved in such appointments is simply ridiculous. The Minister is also massaging the waiting lists in what he calls &ldquo;the validation&rdquo;. In the Western Health Board area, for example, 547 were removed in the validation, which means that the waiting list is now greater than it was in June 1997 when the Government took office. I could go on for an hour but will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion and thank Deputy McManus and her colleagues for tabling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing illustrates the way the two tier system operates as clearly as the system of allocation of medical cards and the treatment of patients in primary care. When we think of, and talk about, the health crisis we usually mean the problems in secondary care where it is most acute because of waiting lists and the number of bed closures. When we talk about apartheid in the system we are also referring to secondary health care. We have an apartheid medical health system and the reality is that the better off one is the longer one lives. For professionals aged 55 years and over, the death rate recorded by the ESRI is 13 per thousand. For those on lower incomes in the same age group the death rate is three times that figure. Much of it has to do with the fact that poorer people cannot afford the best of medical treatment and sometimes, because of their low incomes, their diets are not as good. Perhaps they turn to smoking as a way of relieving pressure because they cannot afford other more expensive outlets available to richer people. One would think, therefore, that in trying to end apartheid in the system we would look at these poorer people and, at the very least, ensure in primary care they have access to medicine and are treated well. The point about primary care is that it is much more <Col N="1480" /> egalitarian and everyone sees the same doctor if they can afford to go and see one.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the Government and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that 40% of the population are entitled to a medical card. Even under this arrangement, only the lowest 40% qualify and because of the mean manner in which the Government applies the rules even this part of the community is not receiving cover. The Government has unilaterally restricted the medical card to 30.32% of the population, as at 31 December 2000, according to a written parliamentary reply received by me today. One in four of those entitled to seek cover under the IMO standing agreement with the Government is denied his or her entitlement at a time of plenty. I do not understand this. As up to 37% of the population have qualified in the past, why have they been removed? Why has the rate of medical card cover fallen to just over 30% when the agreement with the IMO provides for a figure of up to 40% considering it has been 37% and higher in times gone by? This means that a single person on £101 per week is over the new entitlement limit, falling to £89 if single and living with family. The figure is as low as £144.50 for a married couple. Yet, we have an agreement with the IMO to cover those on incomes higher than that basic, mean amount of money provided for by the Government.</P>
    <P>The medical card is being withheld improperly from very poor people. Is it any wonder that we have a crisis in secondary care when those on modest incomes cannot access what should be their first port of call, primary care, with all the implications this has for preventive medicine and ultimately for those ending up taking up a hospital bed in secondary care? In policy proposals published last November, Fine Gael proposed doubling the income limits in order to ensure full 40% cover as provided for in the agreement with the IMO immediately. It would mean the following limits. A single person would be able to earn up to £10,200, up from £4,870, a married couple under the age of 66 years would be able to earn £16,820, up from £7,044 and a married couple over the age of 66 years would be able to earn £19,720, up from £8,760, under the Fine Gael proposals. Fine Gael announced a doubling of the limits last November in our document. However, it is still not enough to increase a single income to £10,200 and to say that anyone with an income less than that will get a medical card. An income of £16,820 for a married couple is not generous for medical card cover. However, people on half that income are being disqualified at present. Only 30% or three out of every four people who could be covered by the medical card by agreement with the IMO are not covered at a time of huge budget surpluses.</P>
    <P>I propose extending by agreement with the IMO free general practitioner services to children up to 18 years and beyond that age if they are in full-time education, to all senior citizens over the age of 65 years and to those in the lower 60% of <Col N="1481" /> income groups with special provision for asthma sufferers and those with similar chronic disabilities. The estimated cost of bringing the medical card up to the full 40% would be approximately £130 million a year. We should add on the free general practitioner services for those people who should be targeted. It is hard to believe that Sir Anthony O'Reilly, Deputy Gay Mitchell or the Minister, Deputy Martin, should be entitled to a medical card or free general practitioner services. If we target it in the way Fine Gael is proposing, it would cost another £300 million. Expenditure on the medical card and the free general practitioner service would, if coupled with a strategic approach to secondary care and to other investment in GP practice development and pharmacies, which we would put forward with a restructured governance of the system, have a major effect in bringing about reform and a successful egalitarian and fair health service. The upper income groups, excluding senior citizens, would continue to be entitled to the drug refund scheme and tax deductions for annual medical expenditure in excess of £100 or £200 for a family.</P>
    <P>Without discussing the overall health services, which I have tried to deal with in other debates and in my policy document, how can we justify denying a medical card to a single person on £101 per week? Some people in this House would not go into a restaurant with £101 in their pockets. This is contributing to the problem. We are not taking seriously the needs of the poorest of the poor. We are, therefore, complicating the health system because when these people become chronically ill, they cannot afford to access primary care and they are then taken into the secondary care system. It would help greatly if that could be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Gay Mitchell could bring in the people from the IMO to whom he has spoken to speak to the Minister and to others involved in health care. He was not speaking to the same spokesperson who last week at the conference publicly advised that discretionary medical cards should be issued sparingly and only by the chief executive officer. Can one imagine what it would be like if someone in charge of 12,000 staff, as is the case in the Southern Health Board, had to sign each medical card? These are the people with whom Deputy Gay Mitchell has a special agreement and who are objecting to giving the over 70s, the people who built the State, free medical cards. There is something wrong when Deputy Gay Mitchell is quoting them. Perhaps new spokespersons are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the type of quick fix solutions we heard about last night. However, there are no simple solutions. Everyone accepts there have been decades of underfunding. I am not a great believer in polls but last week's poll showed that the public blames successive Governments and Ministers for the failure to provide funding. There is no overnight solution to the problem. The Labour Party's solution of universal health <Col N="1482" /> insurance would lead to the closure of many local hospitals. That is not the answer, although it does not do any harm to put it on the agenda for discussion. I am sure Deputy McManus is aware that in 1982 the Conservative Party think-tank proposed such a model to Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet. The proposal was leaked and it triggered one of the biggest rows in Thatcher's premiership. It was too right wing even for her at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister, Deputy Martin, said last night, all studies show that the insurance-based funding system significantly improves the percentage of funding towards administration costs. We heard several Opposition spokespersons refer to the cost of administration. We should try to cut such costs but not by taking on board a proposal such as this from the Labour Party. Deputy Shatter seemed to agree when he spoke in the House on 2 February 2000. He said our health services require radical reform but whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health service is questionable. He said that what was needed was less, not more bureaucracy. The Fine Gael Party has now advanced a similar insurance-based model.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, are more concerned with reform than with making the health service an electoral gimmick. Many of the issues relate to funding. We have doubled the expenditure on health since taking office. It has been increased by an extra £1 billion this year to approximately £5 billion. Many people would argue that the service is still underfunded, but funding is being provided. We want to ensure we get value for money. The Opposition parties threw a meagre amount at our health services while they were in the rainbow coalition. We are hearing more reports about that, including today's evidence at the tribunal. The Minister has established a value for money audit to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value for money from our health service. That is critically important. Every public representative will support that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More people are being treated in our hospitals now than when the rainbow coalition was in office. The waiting lists are shorter and more nurses and doctors are employed in the health service. I am not saying all is well. We, on this side of the House, want extra benefits, facilities and services and we will continue to want that. If Deputy Quinn, who was Minister for Finance, and Deputy Noonan, who was Minister for Health, had not cut the number of nurse training places or the funding for reducing waiting lists, perhaps we could have advanced reform more quickly. If they had invested more in the health services, perhaps some of today's hardships would not be experienced by the people whose cases are being trotted out now. The Minister is <Col N="1483" /> adopting the right approach. The new health strategy is about people and the service and the Government is providing money for it. It should be supported. We must work together to get a better health service for the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with increasing bemusement that I have watched this debate unfold last night and tonight. I wonder if people realise that the proponent of this motion, the Labour Party, was not only in Government but in charge of the Exchequer not too long ago and, therefore, had the opportunity to radically alter the State's policy on health expenditure. The Labour Party could have insisted on increasing health expenditure to any proportion or percentage it liked of GDP as the price of staying in Government and I am sure Deputy John Bruton would not have disappointed it. Do the people realise how abysmally it failed when it was in Government? Do they realise that during the period of the rainbow coalition health expenditure barely kept pace with inflation? Yet we have this huge outpouring of mock indignation. Is it any wonder that young people are turning away from politics and that cynicism has grown apace?</P>
      <P>By contrast, Fianna Fáil in Government since 1997 has reversed a decade long trend of underfunding of our health services. We have introduced significant improvements in a range of important services and we are engaged in an exciting process of developing a new health strategy to address past neglect, underfunding, inefficiencies and inequality. By contrast, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance in the rainbow Government, managed to raise health spending by a shameful £400 million over the 2.5 year lifetime of that Government. Deputy Quinn, the leader of the tax and spend party, as Minister for Finance had no problem taxing but had a major block when it came to spending on health, education and social inclusion.</P>
      <P>That Government also had a third component, the late, unlamented Democratic Left, now not-so-sadly defunct. If that party was unhappy with a Government that was not prepared to increase health expenditure at all in real terms, it could have walked away and brought that Government to an end. Where was Deputy McManus's latent indignation then? Why did it not boil up then? Does the Deputy have to go into opposition and wait four years to rediscover her conscience and her indignation about the health care system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, working closely with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has doubled the amount we spend on health per annum. This year's allocation of roughly £5 billion, together with the increases since 1997, will go some way to rectifying the effects of under funding and neglect which were exacerbated during Deputy Quinn's tenure at the Department of Finance and Deputy <Col N="1484" /> Noonan's tenure at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>During the years of the rainbow Government this was a wealthy State. The funds were available for greatly increased health spending. Why was it not spent? It is true that at that time there was not a budgetary surplus. The surplus was to come later, due to the fiscal policies of this Government. Was the existence of a small deficit an excuse for such under funding of the health services on the scale presided over by Deputies Noonan and Quinn? </P>
    <P>The Labour Party's fiscal policy document, &ldquo;New Directions, New Priorities&rdquo;&ndash; the latest chapter from the source of continuous fiction that is the Labour Party policy unit &ndash; would return the state coffers to deficit financing. Labour seems ideologically wedded to deficit financing. Why then, was the Labour Party so shy when it came to funding our health services between 1995 and 1997? How can it, with a straight face, criticise the reforming enthusiasm of this Government?</P>
    <P>There are huge problems in our health services and we have been first to admit it. We have been the first Government to seriously attempt to tackle them. The country will be delighted to know there is now an alternative. I have read the Labour Party document with great interest. It is on the one hand bizarre and on the other very funny. It is a policy document version of &ldquo;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.&rdquo;  It is a combination of Thatcherite capitalism and champagne socialism to what end it is not clear. However, there are two ends it will achieve. It will close local hospitals and hugely increase expenditure on administration.</P>
    <P>We will not proffer gimmicky, quick-fix solutions as the Labour Party do. We provide the funding. We provide the improvements. We provide the reforms. We provide the way forward in terms of health strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for older people and food safety, I take pleasure in coming before the House this evening to set out the real improvements the Government has been able to effect since June 1997 when the electorate delivered its verdict on the Governmental record of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
      <P>Under funding was the hallmark of the rainbow Government in the area of health, so that when we assumed office in 1997 there was an urgent need for investment in the area of services for older people. To date, as a result of increased investment, imagination and determination, we have succeeded in creating an additional 800 posts in that area. Spending in this area has increased from £10 million in 1997 to £57 million in 2001. For every £1 the rainbow Government invested in services for older people, we invest more than £4. That shows commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The reforms and improvements do not end there. Last year's winter initiative, which cost £25 million, alleviated pressures on acute beds by placing elderly patients in more appropriate facilities such as nursing homes. There are more geriatricians, psychiatrists of old age and paramedics. We are making medical cards available to all people over the age of 70. Heating services have improved, along with carer's allowances and home help. We have also looked at prevention in the areas of cancer, cardiovascular problems and osteoporosis.</P>
    <P>Spending on palliative care is up from £3 million to £15 million in 2001. This year palliative care services will be expanded in all health board areas and the report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care will be published this year. We are enhancing existing community care services and developing new ones. We place special emphasis on rehabilitation and stroke care services.</P>
    <P>Where the Department of Health and Children can improve the lot of our older people through close co-operation with other Departments, we have proved eager to do so. We have co-operated with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Environment and Local Government in the area of housing. In the forthcoming health strategy, the needs of older people will be comprehensively addressed.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party motion provides an opportunity to examine the decreases in the waiting lists which this Government through its policies have effected in our health services. It also provides an opportunity to analyse the record in Government of the Labour Party and Fine Gael. In the rainbow Government between 1995 and 1997 they had an opportunity, but failed to effect a decrease in waiting lists.</P>
      <P>This Government's policy on waiting lists has been clear. We are committed to reducing public waiting lists. We inherited exceedingly long waiting lists from the preceding Administration. Our policy has been successful. Its policy was not. The figures show that the waiting list at the end of December, 2000, was almost 2,600 lower than it was in June 1997, the date of the last general election. No matter how the Opposition massages and distorts the figures, they are lower today than they were during its watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is investing and its policies are yielding results. We are providing the funding to reduce waiting lists through the waiting lists initiative. This year we have allocated funding of £34.5 million under the waiting lists initiative to enable hospitals to carry out procedures and we have reviewed the underlying cause of waiting lists. In 1998, a major review of the cause of waiting lists was undertaken by an expert group established to that end. This group made valuable short, medium and long-term recommendations to minimise waiting lists. These are being put in <Col N="1486" /> place. Good progress has been made by a number of the agencies involved.</P>
    <P>Some of the long-term infrastructure issues are being addressed by the national development plan. Much of the £2 billion capital investment in our health services will aid a greater reduction in waiting lists. We have initiated a national review of bed capacity. This review involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. It will include a detailed assessment of future bed requirements. We have also initiated the winter initiative. This initiative which involved £25 million investment is targeted at a number of key areas including approval to recruit 25 more accident and emergency consultants, approval to recruit 15 more consultant anaesthetists, provision of at least 500 additional nursing home places, and development of a new acute assessment unit in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>We have not cured the problem. The waiting lists remain, but the main point is that they are coming down. There is a long way to go but our policies plainly work. Since June 1997 our hospitals are busier. Last year alone an extra 42,000 patients were treated than in 1999. This places the decreases in waiting lists in better perspective. Waiting lists are being reduced at a time when there are more patients being treated. This is a feature of the economy generally. The health system faces infrastructure pressures because of the growth in our population and the booming economy. The latest figures show that the waiting list for cardiac surgery halved in 2000. There were significant reductions in other key areas. For example, the waiting lists for orthopaedics were down by 29%, ophthalmology, 27% and ENT, 24%. In the past three years almost £80 million has been made available to health agencies to reduce waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy document, A New Patriotism, contains the admission that &ldquo;waiting lists are a politically created phenomenon&rdquo;. It behoves the Members opposite to examine this statement because, in 1997, Deputy Noonan, as Minister for Health and Children, and Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, cut the funding allocated for the reduction of waiting lists by 20%. This was sanctioned despite the fact that there were 2,600 more on waiting lists than there are today. What we are hearing is something of a hypocritical denunciation of the Government, which is making a brave effort to reduce waiting lists at a time when hospitals are becoming increasingly busy.</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that we should spend, willy-nilly, increasing amounts on health services without examining the underlying causes of waiting lists, medical inflation and, more importantly, the high level of spending in the administration of hospitals. There is no point investing money in hospitals if it will not be spent on providing frontline care and reducing waiting lists and not result in a better and more enhanced service for patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> I remind the House and the Minister that, as Members will be aware from their constituency work, it is often the attitude shown to a patient arriving in hospital which is so important. I make no bones about the fact that we require a more patient or customer focused approach in our hospitals because patients in hospital sometimes feel that their rights are not being respected, that they are not getting their dues or entitlements and that the attitude shown to them is wrong. The Minister has already begun to address this matter. Some believe, for whatever reason, that when they arrive in hospital they are put to the end of the queue or treated in a way that is not humane or proper. This is a feature of all our public services and it must change. If one telephones a local authority or Government office, one is met with an attitude that one can wait in the queue just like everyone else. This is not acceptable because members of the public have greater expectations than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Martin was given the Health and Children portfolio. His performance in handling the Education and Science portfolio was excellent. The area of health is his next big challenge and I believe he will resolve any problems which obtain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Labour Party motion which affords everyone in the House the opportunity to discuss the current state of the health service and our future policies and strategies in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to developing a world class, equitable and accessible health system. To do so, we need real and lasting improvements. We need to work in partnership with everyone who has a role to play in health care in order to create the root and branch reform which is so necessary. That is what the new health strategy is about. Before we entered office, the system was struggling to survive. There was insufficient investment, derisory increases in spending, cuts in funding to reduce waiting lists and the health professionals who form the basis of the health system found that their skills and dedication were simply not being acknowledged or developed. The system was in crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For four years we have been dealing with this situation and our efforts will culminate in the Government's new health strategy, which will be published this summer. Just as our current economic prosperity was built in partnership with the social partners, the health strategy is being arrived at through public consultation in partnership with the health stakeholders and the general public. At the foundation of the strategy are the reports and assessments we have already carried out of the needs of the health service, the medical manpower forum and the report on junior hospital doctor working practices. These are real efforts to address the needs of health professionals. Similarly, we are implementing the reforms suggested by the Commission on Nurs<Col N="1488" /> ing. The 30,000 hard-working nurses who form the frontline of our health services need better opportunities to train and better working conditions which we are attempting to provide, again, in partnership. Another element of the strategy &ndash; an element the Opposition has ignored &ndash; is the value for money audit. The charge that we are throwing money at the problem is plainly untrue.</P>
    <P>These various reports and assessments, with the findings of the largest public consultation ever carried out in the health service and the input of the national consultative forum &ndash; which has been established to give health stakeholders a real input into the strategy &ndash; will be brought together to form our national health strategy which will be evaluated by outside international experts as it develops. A great deal depends on the strategy and we are doing all we can to ensure we get it right.</P>
    <P>Understandably, this huge and complex process has taken time. Members of the Opposition castigate us for this. They would rather that we followed their past example, namely, to do a rush job or find a quick fix solution, which, in the long term, would exacerbate our health difficulties. That is not what the Government is intent on doing. We aim to put in place a health service which will provide the best medical care for the poorest of our citizens, without undue delay or inconvenience. That is the basis of the health strategy.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we have continued with investment. A £2.5 billion increase in health expenditure during the lifetime of the Government against a £400 million rise during the term of office of the rainbow coalition shows our commitment. We have embarked upon the largest building and modernisation programme in the history of the State. Some 50,000 more day cases and 40,000 more in-patient cases have been dealt with in our hospitals since 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has stressed on a number of occasions that maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is not an option. The Government is concerned with reform and improvement in our health services. The investment is delivering and the policies and strategies are being put in place. In the light of his record to date in the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, I have no doubt that the Minister, who has the necessary energy and commitment, access to finance, will put in place a strategy which will deliver. As a result, we will have a state-of-the-art health service which will be at the cutting edge of development and deliver, effectively and efficiently, services to customers and patients who must currently spend time on waiting lists. There is always pain before gain. However, in this instance, the Minister will deliver on his commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Government can be quite pleased with the action they have taken in the area of health in recent years. I accept that there are problems, but the Govern<Col N="1489" /> ment was obliged to deal with the aftermath of decades of underfunding by successive Governments. The action taken has helped the health service turn the corner, with the result that it is now headed in the right direction. When the Minister finalises the new health strategy and draws together the various policy issues later in the summer, what will emerge will show us the way forward.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister have tackled many issues which, historically, were never touched upon by previous Administrations. Consider, for example, the area of cigarette smoking and tobacco addiction. I understand up to 7,000 in Ireland die each year as a result of smoking. This is a colossal number and, as someone stated, higher than the number who died of TB each year in the 1940s. Despite this, the issue was neglected by successive Governments and Ministers for Health because there were always other priorities. Now, however, the current Minister is tackling it and new legislation will be brought forward in the near future.</P>
      <P>Nobody is suggesting that the health service is perfect. One can be negative and critical and find fault with it, left, right and centre. I have no intention of condoning some of the behaviour which obtains in accident and emergency departments in Dublin hospitals, particularly the Mater. It is frustrating that three and a half years after the Department of Health and Children approved the building of a new accident and emergency department at the Mater not one brick has been laid. The Minister cannot do the construction work himself. Due to changes of plans or whatever, the authorities at the hospital are still discussing, arguing and hiring increasing numbers of consultants instead of getting on with the job. Three and a half years have passed since the Minister gave capital approval for the project.</P>
      <P>The experience of most people and patients of hospitals is through their accident and emergency departments. I welcome the fact that the Minister announced months ago that he was appointing new accident and emergency consultants. However, he has not received a great deal of co-operation in that regard because the consultants &ndash; who seem to have too much power &ndash; seem to believe that the accident and emergency department is the least important part of a hospital. As regards the hospitals in my area, the Mater seems to think people die only from heart attacks, Beaumont seems to think people die only from neurological complaints or something similar and I do not know what they deal with in St. Vincent's.</P>

      <P>Is it? Perhaps they think people only die from that. Hospitals appear to be controlled by consultants who are only interested in the national specialty which is their major area of concern. The accident and emergency area is where old and sick people go and it does not get the priority required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> I was delighted to hear of the Minister sanctioning new posts for consultants in the accident and emergency departments. That is the way to treat people, to give them early care and either discharge them or admit them to hospital. One can be negative or look at the good aspects. To listen to complaints in the House and outside, one would think nothing good was happening. A massive amount of money has been invested in the health service in recent years. It is not just money either. Some 14,000 extra staff have been recruited and they cannot all be office staff. More than 4,000 were doctors, nurses and paramedics. Those are colossal numbers.</P>
    <P>We hear about waiting lists but the number of procedures and outpatient appointments have increased. Some 80,000 more procedures are performed now than were performed four years ago. That is an enormous increase. The number of nurses has increased hugely. Foreign nurses are being recruited and more nurses are in training. Sometimes all one hears is about nurses not being available which creates problems and lengthens waiting lists. A massive amount of good is being done and many of the structures being put in place will be pulled together by the new strategy which, I hope, will point things in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The perception of many people is that, while the Minister ought to be the boss, he is not. He must take on the many vested interests. Even the consultants seem to have different views and shout only for investment in their specialties. They are very good at approving or stalling initiatives of the Minister when they wish to do so. We must all pull together. The Government can provide the strategy and resources but people in the health service must provide the management and get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies O'Sullivan, Wall, Shortall and Gilmore.</P>
      <P>It is exactly 50 years since a Minister for Health was driven from the House by powerful vested interests on the simple principle that he was in favour of universalism in health care. In this case it was health care for mothers and children. Last week I met a young mother who brought her child of two weeks to a general practitioner for a defect in the child's eye. She was asked when leaving if she had paid the £25. She was told the six weeks' post-natal care system only applied to participating doctors. That prompted me to ask what had been achieved in 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to be positive. Taking up on what the previous speaker said, the House must make up its mind on the universal provision of basic health care. It is a scandal that private insurance pays 9% of the costs of the health system and, at the same time, seeks to benefit from a two tier health system where 80% of those on insurance can have their procedures carried out within four weeks while the rest of the population which subsidises this inequity through general taxation must wait <Col N="1491" /> years. I am not interested in going back over old arguments about who is responsible for what. Fifty years ago an attempt to provide universal care for mothers and children from the moment of conception until the children were safe was opposed by powerful vested interests.</P>
    <P>The problem in the health service is one of funding and, more important, one of moral courage. It is about whether the courage exists to face those vested interests which stand in the way of putting in place a universal health care system. I listened with interest to those who said we are on the way to having a world class service. One has only to think of all the international reports which note the unique nature of the Irish system, that it appears to be prejudiced against the idea of general universal State care in health.</P>
    <P>It is time we lifted ourselves out of this historical morass. This means facing consultants so as to be able to put in place a career structure for junior hospital doctors and junior consultants. It means taking up on the positive suggestions made by groups such as the Irish College of General Practitioners and trying to enhance general practitioner provision by supplementing it with, for example, local clinics. It is ridiculous that minor ailments, including ones which require X-rays and whatever, should be funnelled into the acute hospitals. It means dealing with GPs in a new regime offering a free GP service. It means establishing local and district clinics with paramedics and good nurses who are able to provide this service.</P>
    <P>It is clear that many procedures do not take place because of the non-availability of nurses. Those in charge of nursing training say the numbers coming forward now are a fraction of the numbers who came forward before. There was an appalling refusal rate in the past of people who wanted to enter nursing. In addition, one of the effects of speculation in housing is that young nurses cannot afford to live in the cities where hospitals are located. They cannot afford to take the jobs. These are realities.</P>
    <P>I met the wife of an 83 year-old patient in my constituency clinic three weeks ago. He was offered a procedure which required him to wait on a trolley. He was not able to do that and simply went away. The manner in which health care is delivered is a mark of a society.</P>
    <P>This raises another question, the answer to which I and other Members know the answer. From where did this Irish obsession with means testing come? It comes from the Poor Law. It is as simple as that. It is an inheritance. I do not have any difficulty with paying such taxation as will pay for general universal health care. I regard it as a mark of the society in which I want to live. The obsession with means testing emanates from the old ticket mentality and an enormous amount of resources is wasted on these qualifications.</P>
    <P>We who are elected are supposed to stand and act with courage. It was a disgrace that an abuse of a principle of Catholic social teaching <Col N="1492" /> destroyed Dr. Noel Browne's scheme in 1951. It was the lowest ebb for the medical profession that its agents searched dustbins to discover who were the authors of documents concerned with that controversy. The issue remains the same. Is it not time we put these silly prejudices apart, faced the vested interests, responded to the public and said that what we need is universal care and that it would be exceptional that there would be any other special provision? Is it not obscene that people seek tax concessions in the Finance Act to provide private medicine with public subsidy, investing in the sickness industry, as it were, at a time when the health service needs radical reform?</P>
    <P>I am not interested in trading blame about absence of provision in the past. I am interested in something else, namely, a courageous announcement of a radical re-organisation. We should invite in those concerned, face them and say that privilege and monopoly will not have any place in depriving the public of a general, accessible, democratic, egalitarian health system that could be compared not with the world but with the European Union. We have 80% of the provision of other respectable countries in the European Union. The money is there to do it now. All that is required is the imagination and the political will to face those who are standing in the way of the public's right to adequate health care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It now appears that even the Minister for Health and Children has come around to the view that a radical reform of the health service is required. Unfortunately, he has not been able to persuade the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government of the necessity for this and the need to begin to tackle this issue.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the grant of medical cards to all people over the age of 70 is a smokescreen for neglect in many aspects of care of the elderly and the provision of health care for the elderly. The vast majority of people over 70 already have a medical card and it is of little use to them if they cannot get support services in the community, a bed in an acute hospital if they require an operation or an affordable long-stay bed if they are unable to look after themselves and do not have a family member to take care of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of providing supports in the community so that elderly people and people with physical disabilities can stay at home, surrounded by friends and neighbours is good and humane. However, this is not happening. Home helps, public health nurses, chiropodists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and a wide variety of other support services are not there in sufficient numbers to provide the support needed. The back-up needed to make the physical environment suitable is not there. The housing aid for the elderly scheme, the disabled person's grant, aids and appliances &ndash; if one gets beyond the waiting list for an occupational therapist for an <Col N="1493" /> assessment in the first place &ndash; all have long waiting lists. If a person is more than 80 years of age and cannot come home from hospital or nursing home unless one or a combination of these services is available immediately, he will be said to be inappropriately occupying an acute hospital bed. Alternatively he may be sent to a private nursing home which he cannot afford because of the gap between the cost of the nursing home and his income.</P>
    <P>Physiotherapy can be most effective in helping a quick recovery from many conditions and after orthopaedic operations. Orthopaedics is one of the specialities which have the longest waiting lists. Time is of the essence if physiotherapy is to be effective, yet a sign in the physiotherapy department of the mid-west regional hospital reads, &ldquo;Waiting time for physiotherapy &ndash; 394 days&rdquo;. What use is that to somebody who needs physiotherapy immediately? Why are we not training more physiotherapists? Clearly, a great number of young people want to train for this profession because the entry requirement for training is one of the highest in the country.</P>
    <P>Why is only £200 million provided for capital development of services for older people for the years up to 2006 in the national development plan when countless millions are available for the Bertie Bowl, for example? We know the elderly population will steadily increase during those years but we are seriously lacking in terms of public beds.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister for Health and Children the number of long stay public geriatric beds in each of the health board areas but he was not able to tell me. He did not have the statistics. This is unacceptable in an era when we should plan for these things.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has closed nearly 50 long stay beds in St. Camillus's Hospital in Limerick in recent years, purely for financial reasons. This is shameful and should not happen at a time when our elderly population is increasing and we are all fully aware of the needs of the elderly. What are senior citizens who cannot look after themselves supposed to do?</P>
    <P>There are at least 55 beds ready to be occupied by sick people in the Limerick regional hospital in fully equipped wards. My party leader saw them with me last week. The Minister agrees that we need more beds. I ask him to give us the funds to open these beds. The health service needs the radical reform proposed by my colleague, Deputy Liz McManus, and outlined by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. In the meantime, specific actions can be taken to ease the pain while we are waiting for the cure. Let us see some real commitment to the elderly in the community and in our hospitals and homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has failed to provide adequate child welfare and protection services. On coming to office the Government changed the name of the Department of Health to the Department of Health and <Col N="1494" /> Children. This, it seems, was a change in name only because the situation for vulnerable children &ndash; those most at risk &ndash; has disimproved considerably in the past four years. It is shameful, in the midst of huge wealth, that the waiting list for social workers for child victims of abuse and neglect are getting longer and longer. These are children about whom there are serious suspicions of sexual abuse, physical abuse or neglect and they have been abandoned by the Government. They are left to wait, often for months on end, to see a social worker.</P>
      <P>In the Northern Area Health Board area there are currently 686 children on such waiting lists and almost 200 of these are regarded as priority cases. These are children about whose safety there are grave concerns because of the suspicion, and in many cases the sure knowledge, that they are being abused or seriously neglected. Many of these children, who have suffered from State neglect and others who have suffered for other reasons, go on to develop serious behavioural problems and will, undoubtedly, end up before the courts. Even when things have got to the point where a child is, chillingly, deemed to be out of control the State's response is abysmal. Hardly a week goes by without such a case coming to media attention and frequently these children are returned to highly inappropriate settings or, worse, left to their own devices on the streets because the Government seems incapable of meeting their care needs.</P>
      <P>The legislative basis for the care of such troubled children dates back to 1908. On coming to office the Government was presented with a Bill to update the law in that area but it chose to postpone the introduction of the Bill for three years and it was not until late last year that another version of what we now know as the Children Bill was produced. That Bill is making its tortuous way through the various stages and will, I hope, soon be enacted. However, there is no provision for the implementation of that legislation and no resources have been made available for the huge additional staff which will be needed to give it effect.</P>
      <P>The failure to provide basic child welfare services has resulted from the refusal of the Government to provide adequate resources. The Northern Area Health Board requested an additional £18 million to meet the needs of children in these situations. A measly £6 million was granted by the Government. Very often the Minister and his colleagues are inclined to give the impression that money is not a problem these days but when money is needed the Government is not making it available. If money is needed anywhere it is needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has refused to engage in any type of long-term planning for the training of social workers and child care workers. I have concentrated on the most urgent and critical aspects of the child protection services. It is not surprising, in the context of the Government's failures <Col N="1495" /> in this regard, that the Minister has also failed utterly to put in place the kind of early intervention that can help to ensure that these problems do not occur at a later stage in a child's life.</P>
    <P>Apart from a few very minor pilot projects which the Minister has announced on umpteen occasions, the Government is content to pay lip service to the needs and rights of the most vulnerable children in the country. The Minister should be ashamed of that situation.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me on this vitally important subject. The Minister has responsibility for health and, to all intents and purposes his Department plays a major part in the daily lives of practically every family. The Minister has failed dismally to improve the conditions of, and facilities for, those in need and those who are servicing their needs. However, I am willing to give the Minister an opportunity to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Something should be done in the short term either in hospitals or nursing homes to alleviate the respite care problems that families have. In the local hospital in my constituency, people are spending up to 72 hours on trolleys, chairs and bed tents. Sadly, in practically all cases, it is old people who are affected. This is the aspect that hurts anyone who goes into that hospital. I have seen people in their 70s and 80s, and in one case in his 90s, having to suffer in those conditions. They have no privacy. They have to use a bedpan in an open corridor where people are passing by and they must undress in an open corridor with no protective facilities to afford the privacy that is so important, especially to the elderly.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can tell the House that something will be done in the short term to alleviate the problems of those people and their families by addressing their concerns, I am willing to give him a chance. In that case I would say the Minister is willing to do something. If that is not the case, however, and if the Minister leaves the situation as it is, he will be named as someone who failed dramatically to address the needs of the least well off in our society.</P>
      <P>In many cases the reason such people are in that position in hospitals is because there are no recuperation or observation facilities to cater for their needs. Since there are no beds available for them in nursing homes or alternative hospital accommodation, hospitals cannot carry on basic accident and emergency duties. These are the major problems that people are experiencing in the health service. The families of those concerned are complaining about these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £40 million is being spent on Naas Hospital, yet the benefit will only amount to an extra 24 beds. If one takes into consideration the number of people in hospital corridors at present, that means that the problem will not be allevi<Col N="1496" /> ated. That is despite the fact that Kildare is one of the fastest advancing areas in the entire country, which is adjacent to Dublin and with part of the county being within the greater Dublin area. Despite major investments in health, problems are still being experienced in my area. Thirty people are on the waiting list for geriatric care in my local hospital but there is not a hope of getting anyone into it.</P>
    <P>Last week a family telephoned me about a 94-year-old relative who could not get a hospital place for respite care. Despite the best efforts of the matron and staff who did everything that was humanly possible, it was not possible for that elderly person to receive help because respite care is a thing of the past. So many people are seeking long-term care that we do not have the facilities to deal with such demand and beds that were hitherto available for respite care are being taken up by other patients. The elderly are suffering most, even though they are the most vulnerable in society. Families are on their knees looking after their older members who need full-time care. Such carers cannot even get a day or a week's holiday to escape from the strain of caring for those poor people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can do something about that he will have done a good day's work for which he will be remembered. If he does not, however, he will be just one in a queue of people who have accepted what is unacceptable and will not have done anything for our senior citizens in their hour of greatest need. The elderly have sought comfort, consolation and kindness but none is forthcoming because we have not provided sufficient facilities for health workers to care for the needy.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and I know hospital staff in that region have in all cases gone way beyond the call of duty to meet the concerns of their patients.</P>

      <P>Thank you. Last week I was told of the case of a junior doctor on his 48th hour on duty who was trying to do his best to facilitate his patients within the hospital's remit. The Minister must do something now. He has failed twice in going to the Cabinet table. He must put the case to the Cabinet again and obtain the necessary facilities in the short term. It is no use looking at this matter in the long term because those who are suffering today will not be placated in such a manner and neither will it do anything to ease their pain. The Oireachtas cannot take pride in the fact that people are suffering in such circumstances at present.</P>

      <P>I draw attention to the case of an individual whose story highlights so much of what is unjust, unfair and unequal in our health care <Col N="1497" /> system which is presided over by the Minister for Health and Children. This is the story of a medical card patient, a man whose wife wrote to the Minister for Health and Children on 21 June 1998 as follows:</P>
      <P>I am writing to you to request a total reimbursement of a medical bill due to my husband undergoing an emergency cardiac by-pass operation in the Blackrock Clinic in County Dublin this month. Previous to being taken into hospital, my husband was suffering with increasing chest pains. Consequently, he went to see his doctor who examined him and thought his symptoms were angina. The doctor made an appointment for my husband to have preliminary tests with a specialist in the Blackrock Clinic. Initially, the specialist could find nothing wrong with my husband but when he underwent a stress test he failed it. Following this my husband had an angiogram carried out on him in order to try and flush out any blocked arteries. During this procedure the consultant found a blockage very near the heart, which was so serious that an operation was needed immediately.</P>
      <P>This man found himself in the expensive Blackrock Clinic with his medical card. He was told that he had a very serious condition which required immediate surgery. He had two choices: he could either authorise the medical people to go ahead with the surgery, or he could get back in the queue. As I think most people would decide in those circumstances, he and his family authorised the medical people to go ahead with the surgery. He subsequently received a bill for £12,500&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which he paid through a loan he obtained from his daughter who happens to work in a Third World country. He then appealed to the Minister for Health and Children to pay at least some of this amount because he found himself in a very difficult situation. This matter has been going on for three years now. I have raised it in the House before and I have written to the Minister and the health board about it but all to no avail. As I was told in a reply to a parliamentary question on 10 May:</P>
      <P>Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That scandalously demonstrates the upstairs, downstairs nature of our medical system. The Minister was effectively telling this man he was lucky to be alive and to pay the bill himself. He is lucky to be alive because his doctor realised he had a problem and referred him to a consultant, <Col N="1498" /> the man chose to go to a private consultant rather than join the queue and opted for immediate surgery rather than take a chance with his life by joining a long waiting list for the surgery he needed.</P>
    <P>If he was a wealthy man, there would not be any question about his right or entitlement to get the best treatment in one of the most expensive medical centres in the State but because he is a medical card patient he was told he must join the queue. It is a scandalous way to treat people who are ill and in need of urgent medical care. There is no justification, if Ireland is to be a civilised country, for essential life and death treatment to be delivered on the basis of whether one can afford the fees in the Blackrock Clinic or one is a medical card patient.</P>
    <P>It also highlights another problem particular to my constituency and that of my party health spokesperson, Deputy McManus, and that is the inadequacy of hospital services in my constituency, County Wicklow and the south side of Dublin generally. There is no general or regional hospital between St. Vincent's Hospital in Ballsbridge and Wexford town. There are hospitals such as St. Michael's in Dún Laoghaire and St. Colmcille's in Loughlinstown. The staff of those hospitals are excellent and they deliver a good service but they cannot deliver the full range of hospital services which are available in one form or another in other parts of the country. This region is one of the fastest growing in the State. One only has to reflect on the development taking place and the growth in population in the region, yet there is no general hospital.</P>
    <P>People who need hospital treatment in the part of Dublin I represent must drive themselves or be taken by ambulance through heavy traffic to one or other of the city centre hospitals to get treatment. It is about time the Government addressed the critical need for a new regional or general hospital in this area. The management of Loughlinstown hospital is pressing for this as it is urgently needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has invested more than £90 million in the provision of extra services to vulnerable children which means that in 2001 alone more than £180 million will be spent to ensure children can be supported by their own families. Thousands of children are availing of family support projects and there are springboard projects in every health board.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced the children first guidelines for the protection of children to ensure abuse can no longer take place. Cases of abuses can at least be recognised and identified and the children involved can be supported. We have also increased the allowances and supports for foster carers who provide a home for children who do not have a home of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> The Government increased the number of places for children who are very disturbed and need high support or special care from 17 when we entered office to 83, with 56 more due to be provided. Recognising that recruitment of staff is a difficulty, we increased the salary scale to attract the right calibre of people to this difficult work. The Government established the social services inspectorate to inspect children's accommodation to ensure standards are maintained and children are protected.</P>
    <P>We have provided more than £7 million towards combating youth homelessness and this has led to Focus Ireland acknowledging in recent interviews that such resources were not ever before invested in this area nor was there such commitment to solving the problem and supporting children and their families to make sure they do not end up homeless.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of issues needs to be tackled regarding children and a great deal of work has yet to be done. Major work needs to be done on the co-ordination of services. The national children's strategy has been launched and is being implemented. The national children's office has been established while the national children's Cabinet committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, has met as has the national children's advisory council. Children are being given a voice for the first time throughout the country. That is the type of commitment that has been witnessed from the Government regarding children.</P>
    <P>I accept children need to be protected and their welfare must be of paramount importance. They are the most vulnerable people in society but for once in our lives this Government is the one that has recognised that and has begun to provide increased investment, resources and supports for our children in a way not ever witnessed before. More needs to be done but our commitment is to ensure that we continue to do more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McManus. &ldquo;Four wasted years&rdquo; are three words to describe four years of disaster. It has taken four years for the Government to recognise that there is a growing crisis in our health services. The Government parties are the &ldquo;Johnny come lately&rdquo;, arriving at the scene of an accident that they have caused. There will be a great deal of huffing and puffing over the next few months but it will be in vain. They know the health services is not the issue that makes the Government's heart tick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the four wasted years in the health services were trusted to the stewardship of the current Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister spent as much time trying to get out of the <Col N="1500" /> Department as seeking to achieve things in it. Health care itself was treated with studied indifference. The suggestion that the health service was like Angola may not have described the condition of the health services when he took over, but it does now. There is no better man to recognise that than the current Minister for Health and Children. He should walk carefully across the minefield. One of the mines blew up in the Cooley Peninsula last week.</P>
    <P>Realising the mess his Government had made of the health services the Taoiseach took a studied decision upon the resignation of his then Minister for Foreign Affairs, to expose the brightest kid on the block, Deputy Martin, to the crisis in the health service. The rest of the members of the Cabinet hid their smiles as the leader in waiting faced his toughest PR job yet. However, even as health Ministers have come and gone, there has been one consistency in the Government and that is the ideological control exercised by the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Health and Children is the latest Minister to experience Deputy McCreevy's ideological intransigence. &ldquo;Private is good&rdquo;, hence the tax reliefs for private hospitals in the budget, and &ldquo;public is bad&rdquo;. This is a simple mantra which he applies to all his projects and it is shared by the Tánaiste, who is, if not his party mate, certainly his soul mate on matters ideological.</P>
    <P>The Government's health strategy is a cynical exercise devised to paper over its failures in time for the election. As Sunday's IMS poll has indicated it will not work. Health is top of the agenda and this Government, through its ineptitude, has put it there. The general election has been the decisive and only factor in health policy thinking in this Government. For example, of the extra moneys committed to the service, 40% have been committed this year alone. Under investment was the order of the day before that. I do not subscribe to the view that money will not make a difference. I hope for the sake of the nation's sick and elderly that the additional resources allocated this year begin to come through quickly.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable that in the age of the Celtic tiger the public should expect more from their health services. A committed Government would seek to make them the best in Europe. What we have got from this Government is disappointment and a PR exercise to patch up on three years' indifference. It will not wash and I hope the Minister and his ministerial colleagues in the Department continue to read out the scripts they used in the debate. I wish them well. God love them, if they come out with that rubbish between now and the next election. I hope the departmental staff continue to write more scripts for them. The occupant of the Chair can tell the Minister all about it.</P>
    <P>This will not get the Government back into office and it will only get back what it put in &ndash;<Col N="1501" /> far too little, far too late. This Government has already earned the &ldquo;trolley mark&rdquo; and, given the potential it had, it is its greatest failing.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has been in Governments when times were difficult, when there were no resources, and listened to some of the current incumbents on this side of the House who saw that was not a problem, I put it to the Minister, sadly, and on behalf of the people who are on the waiting lists that Deputy Gilmore and others spoke about, that we have the worst of all situations now &ndash; a bad Government in good times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my Labour Party colleagues and the other Deputies for their contributions to this debate on the crisis in our health service. We are now calling on the Members of this House to declare where they stand on this most critical social issue facing society today. If they vote for this motion, they will be standing by those unfortunate people who, because they are sick, poor and elderly, believe that they do not have the power to change the circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>Sick people lying for days on trolleys in an accident and emergency department are stripped of their dignity. They are powerless. They have no privacy and no peace of mind. Sometimes they need to use a bed pan. Sometimes they vomit. It is a distressing, humiliating experience and none of us here would wish to go through it. In many cases, for an elderly person, lying on a trolley in a hospital corridor is the culmination of a process of attrition over months or even years of waiting to have the hospital procedure they need and have been denied because, inevitably, as their health deteriorates, they often end up as another emergency case and even then, when they are declared an emergency case, they are still forced to wait on a trolley, simply to get a bed.</P>
      <P>This situation is an affront to decent Irish people. For most people it is an obscenity that at a time of such plenty, we have a Government that is incapable of dealing with our health care crisis. Let us be clear about that. Money is not the problem. According to a recent survey in <i>The Economist</i> magazine, Ireland is now the fifth richest country in the world. After years of deprivation, mismanagement of the economy, massive tax frauds, emigration and poverty, we are now rich. We are now free to do what others could only dream of doing. Money is not the problem. A failure of political will, leadership, vision, commitment and understanding are all part of the problem but most disturbing of all is the fact that this Government does not consider health care to be a priority. Building Sports Campus Ireland is a priority. Planning a mega development as a memorial for a Taoiseach is a priority but health is only a topic for discussion at Cabinet. It is an issue for ideological slapstick, as we saw recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> I want to make it clear that for the Labour Party, health is not just a priority. It is the priority. We are standing by the sick, the infirm and the dying who are entitled to the kind of care and comfort this country could provide but can only provide if it is governed by a leader who is up to the historic opportunity being offered to us.</P>
    <P>There is a core value upon which any good health system is built. It is the core value of equality, the dreaded &ldquo;e&rdquo; word that the Minister for Health and Children, in his contribution, seemed unable to utter. Equality &ndash; care on the basis of need. That has to be the cornerstone of our health service&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister did not deal with equality in his contribution for an obvious and simple reason. Fianna Fáil does not have a clue how to tackle the inequality in our health system. I listened with interest to the Fianna Fáil Deputies who came in here, and some of the Ministers, who listed their objections to the Labour Party proposal. In his contribution the Minister spent some time listing his objections to our proposals. I thank him for that. It is good for us to have feedback. I thought it was a pity that the concepts in our discussion document seem to be beyond the intellectual grasp of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. Generally speaking, however, it is interesting to see that this document is being read by Fianna Fáil Deputies but let us trade when it comes to ideas on equality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;of how he intends to deal with the core value of equality. He talks about many issues and he gets a great deal of coverage, I will grant him that, but he has never faced the difficult issue of how to resolve the basic inequality that exists in our health service that he has not even begun to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> Whatever about the past, there is no reason we should perpetuate the iniquitous, inefficient, under-resourced aspects of our health service. For example, there is no reason cancer patients in the south-east should be denied radiotherapy services. In all, 20,000 people are diagnosed as having cancer each year. Those people deserve urgent attention. They need to see the report, for example, on radiotherapy services fast-tracked and delivered upon. The misplaced urgency concentrated on the Taoiseach's pet project at Abbotstown could, if we directed, transform the lives of cancer patients and of patients in need of emergency care but this Government has no policy on health reform. It is satisfied to wait until the 50 or so reviews, reports and strategy groups come up with proposals, and perhaps then some decisions will be made. That will be too late. The cancer patients cannot wait. Elderly people waiting for hip replacement operations should not have to wait. People losing their sight for want of an eye operation cannot afford to wait.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan pronounced on the hospital waiting lists. Let us hear the truth about the hospital waiting lists. The hospital waiting lists are still not down to the level they were at in December 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then, however, they have shot up under the previous incumbent of the Department of Health and Children. This Minister has made a dint in the figures but some of these people have simply given up, and the Minister has to give credit to the validation process which has reduced a large part of the waiting lists, but let us remember what has been going on during the years of this Government. A total of £67 <Col N="1504" /> million was spent on the waiting lists initiative. This is the Government that promised to tackle the waiting list problem. A huge amount of money has gone in but we have not seen the return.</P>
      <P>That is the legacy that has been left behind by Fianna Fáil now that it is approaching a general election. There is a legacy of failures which we have mapped out in this motion and each one of us will have an opportunity to vote for the motion. We have a choice. We can vote for the Government and the miserable failures and inadequacies but also the avoidance of the hard question, the central issue about inequality that needs to be addressed and which, over four years, has not been addressed either by this Minister for Health and Children or the previous Minister. They are afraid of the dreaded &ldquo;e&rdquo; word. They will not even talk about it or debate it. That is the choice, but there is an alternative. Deputies can vote for our motion. They can vote with the sick, the poor and the elderly who have paid the price for the failure of this Government to tackle the needs in our health service and to ensure that there is real reform along with real funding. These two procedures must be carried out in parallel if we are to secure what we all wish to see, namely, a world class health service which matches our world class economy. We wish to have a health service which meets the needs of those who deserve our care and the professionalism of the medical staff, including nurses, who work so hard despite the many difficulties. I pay tribute to those concerned who, despite the Government's failure, are carrying on because they understand the needs of the patients in their care and have a sense of dedication. These health service personnel and their patients deserve better and we intend to give it to them.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Schools Refurbishment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question about this matter on 20 February. In his reply, the Minister stated that his Department would determine whether the refurbishment of the existing building or the provision of a new building was the better option for the school when stage one &ndash; site suitability and options &ndash; was prepared. Has stage one in the process been reached in order that a decision on the matter can be made?</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the refurbishment cost is conservatively estimated at £2.2 million and that a new school would cost £3.5 million. Clifden could have a new school for £1.5 million extra and still have use of the old building for the school and the community. The school was built for 350 pupils but there are now 468 in attendance. The original school building of 20,400 sq. ft. was one sixth less than the standard required at the time.</P>
      <P>The school has problems relating to space, classrooms, circulation, the lack of social and dining areas for pupils, health and safety issues and staff accommodation, both social and professional. It needs to be evaluated not only from the perspective of the physical structure, but also from the perspective of its educational adequacy. The board believes this aspect has been neglected in the evaluations to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board notes the architect states that the circulation problems will not be fully solved in any renovation. The principal sources of the problem are the current corridors and single stairwell linking the two floors. Extending the corridor at the library end through room six to a <Col N="1509" /> fire escape would mean that the room, which is already substandard in size, could lose approximately 10 square metres. A similar extension proposed on the lower floor leading to the proposed new entrance would create similar difficulties. The preliminary initial budget allows little for significant structural alterations. It allows £8,000 for new altered internal partition walls and only £70,000 for upgrading and altering the selected rooms. The conversion of the current metalwork and woodwork room to four classrooms is proposed and new rooms for metalwork and construction are proposed as part of an extension.</P>
    <P>The obvious solution is for the Department to sanction the building of a new school. The Minister recently met a deputation from the school which, undoubtedly, made a strong and valid case for a new school. Unfortunately, although I am a Deputy for the area and have campaigned on the issue, I was not informed of the deputation. The Government has adopted this practice. I understand the deputation was arranged by the Minister, Deputy Fahey. When my party was in Government Ministers always notified Oireachtas Members with an interest about the arrival of deputations. That practice should be resumed.</P>
    <P>Clifden is the capital of Connemara and it caters for pupils from a wide catchment area. It deserves a new modern school given that the economy is vibrant and the budget is in surplus. It must have one. I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science is not present. I presume he met the deputation. I appeal to the Minister of State to answer my parliamentary question of 20 February inquiring if any decision has been made. I also ask him to convey to the Minister how essential it is that a new community school is sanctioned for Clifden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposals by the Department of Education and Science regarding the work on Clifden community school. The Department has received applications for both refurbishment and additional accommodation from the school authorities. A consultant architect was appointed to undertake a feasibility study of the school to include all buildings and services.</P>
      <P>To assess the findings of the study, officials from the Department's building unit visited the school on 26 April with a view to progressing the project further. As a result of the visit the schedule of overall accommodation was revised and increased to 3,623 square metres to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 425 pupils. This schedule, along with a schedule of suggested future use and a schedule of residual accommodation have been forwarded to the school authorities for their acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> As the Deputy said, the Minister for Education and Science met a deputation from the school yesterday evening to discuss how best to meet the educational needs of the Clifden community. He advised the deputation that until such time as the school authorities agreed the schedules of accommodation, the brief of the project cannot be defined and, therefore, the Department is unable to proceed to the next stage of the project. It was agreed that the school authorities would consider the schedule and confirm their acceptance as soon as possible. Once the schedule has been agreed further consideration will be given to progressing the project at Clifden community school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years I have been to the forefront in supporting the objectives of Aer Rianta to develop Dublin Airport to national and international standards. I also acknowledge the unique contribution the airport has made and will continue to make to the economy of north Dublin, the Dublin region and the country. The high growth in air traffic through the airport and the vehicular congestion on the roads around the airport and to and from the city centre has raised public awareness of environmental issues and the justification for developing the airport to increase passenger numbers from 13 million to 40 million per year with the provision of a second runway.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the decision by Aer Rianta many years ago to plan for a second runway, it is imperative that before work begins on the environmental impact statement we reconsider this decision. I am, therefore, calling on the Minister to commission an independent study of the projected aviation requirements of the country and the desirability of a second international airport in the greater Dublin/midland region. Can anyone envisage the impact of 40 million passenger movements per year at Dublin Airport? It will lead to major traffic congestion, chronic gridlock affecting business and quality of life and the impact of noise pollution on residential areas, such as Portmarnock, St. Margaret's, the southern end of Swords and Baldoyle, where it is envisaged that future developments will take place under the existing flight path of the airport. There will also be miles of car parking with its implications for flooding in the area, high demand for office space developments and a further significant housing demand in the Dublin region at the expense of other regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend a regional approach to meet the civilian aviation needs of the country in the years ahead. The Labour Party national spatial plan <Col N="1511" /> envisages a new planning approach to Ireland as a whole and not solely for Dublin. It also encourages job creation outside Dublin. This was the stated policy of the Government, which is in the process of devising its own plan.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent question the Minster referred to the Warburg Dillon Read report on the review of the strategic options for Aer Rianta. The consultants looked at the capacity of Dublin Airport to meet future needs. It did not consider the environmental effects of trebling the capacity of the airport, nor at alternative locations. As such, the report is flawed. It stated that transport access to Dublin Airport in its present form presents a significant constraint on its ability to meet future passenger growth.</P>
    <P>We live in changed times. There is greater awareness of environmental issues and the quality of life. Those living in the environs of Dublin Airport and under the flight path are no longer prepared to take directions from the Minister and Aer Rianta on issues that affect their daily lives. Rather than engaging in a confrontational approach it would be in the interests of proper planning and balanced regional development if a comprehensive study of alternatives was undertaken.</P>
    <P>The local groups formed to campaign on this issue are not opposed to the development of Dublin Airport, far from it. They have always welcomed planned developments at the airport and they fully support its critical role in employment and the economic development of north Dublin. They accept that the existing runway will be used to its full capacity. A new east-west runway, with all its consequences, is unacceptable to these communities. It is imperative that the Minister and Aer Rianta take cognisance of this and respond accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for sharing his time with me. I am also a great supporter of Dublin Airport. The economic development it has brought to the region is very important, not only to the approximately 16,000 jobs directly at the airport but those associated with its location. However, being a supporter of the airport does not mean I am blind to its needs and to what should or should not happen there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State, as I have on the Minster, to pause, to tell Aer Rianta not to proceed with the EIS on the basis of the need for a second large runway, which would be a fourth runway in total. Time should be taken to undertake a major assessment of the country's aviation needs. Many questions have not been answered to my satisfaction. Why has there not been more development of Shannon, Knock and Cork airports? Why has there not been more development of other regional airports? Dublin Airport <Col N="1512" /> does not have the capacity to be allowed grow its passenger numbers to 40 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The lives of people in Portmarnock are being seriously hampered and damaged by the airport and the noise and pollution emanating from it. In their interests and in the interests of the proper development of the airport I ask the Minister to pause, undertake an assessment and take into account all the different indices before proceeding, if at all, with the second runway. If the Minister does not do that he will do a disservice to the airport, the people working there and the communities in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Ryan and Owen for raising this important issue. The Minister for Public Enterprise outlined the position in regard to the proposed new parallel runway in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 162 of 15 May. As the House is aware, proposals on the development of the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, are, in the first instance, a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport is the country's main airport, serving the needs not just of the travelling public in the capital city and the surrounding counties, but of the country's tourism, business and freight sectors generally. Notwithstanding the greatly welcome increase in traffic at Shannon and Cork airports and to a lesser extent at the regional airports, Dublin Airport will remain crucial to the national economy. Apart from being the country's main access point by air, Dublin Airport has been, and still is, highly significant in terms of the local economy of the north side of Dublin. It provides substantial, valuable employment for the people of the surrounding areas, directly and indirectly, through the multitude of service industries that have evolved in and around the facility. This, of course, is also true of the other two State airports at Shannon and Cork.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is currently engaged in a review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. That review is being carried out in consultation with the stakeholders including airlines, other business customers and local residents. The plan will determine the key requirements for future development of infrastructural facilities to ensure that the airport has sufficient capacity to meet future demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should stop there. That is what we were looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of stakeholder consultation is not yet complete. Regarding the suggestion of the need to identify an alternative facility to serve the Dublin region, I remind the Deputy that this issue was addressed in the consultants' report into the future strategy for Aer Rianta, <Col N="1513" /> which the Minister commissioned from Warburg Dillon Read. The consultants confirmed that Dublin does not need a second airport.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta have appointed an environmental impact consultant to assess the environmental implications of the proposed new runway. While this environmental impact assessment is an essential part of the planning process, it will be an extremely useful and informative study in its own right, leading to a much greater understanding of the issues involved and clarifying for all interested parties the impacts and implications of expanding runway capacity at Dublin Airport. By the end of this year, Aer Rianta will install and commission noise and flight track monitoring equipment which will provide precise measurements of the noise generated by all arriving and departing aircraft at Dublin Airport as well as monitoring and recording the track or flight path flown by those aircraft. This equipment will facilitate the most effective management of runway operations at Dublin and assist in ensuring that local communities experience the least possible disturbance from aircraft noise. Aer Rianta will make the data from this monitoring system available to the local communities and to the planning authority.</P>
      <P>Finally, it should be remembered that the proposal to proceed with the runway project will in the first instance be subject to planning permission being obtained. The planning process will provide the appropriate forum for all interested parties, including local residents, to have their views and any concerns heard and taken into account by the planning authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this most important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that farming on the Cooley Peninsula was gutted by the foot and mouth outbreak and the subsequent cull of livestock. Sheep and cattle were removed for slaughter and farmers were shell-shocked and devastated by the necessary emergency measures. I raised this matter to deal with the serious discontent there is with the level of compensation being offered. Farmers now face a long period without any cashflow because, quite simply, they have no livestock to sell. They also face a potentially high replacement cost later in the year. The extensive cull there means lamb prices in Britain are very high and that will be reflected in the cost of replacement breeding stock for the Cooley farmers. Other measures proposed are inadequate to deal with the financial plight of many farmers and I appeal to the Minister to urgently re-examine the level of compensation offered to the depopu<Col N="1514" /> lated farmers of the Cooley Peninsula. Their future existence is at stake.</P>
    <P>I know most of the farmers personally and they are hard working, decent, diligent people who only seek a fair deal. Unless compensation levels are increased their chances of getting back into sheep production in the short term are in very serious doubt. I appeal to the Minister and his Department to sympathetically and urgently consider the points I have made. They are a reflection of the constituency pressures I, as a public representative, find myself under. They also reflect the pressures the farmers themselves are under.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam soiléiriú a thabhairt ar an gceist seo. I am pleased to have the opportunity to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>I have been very much aware of the difficulties experienced by farmers on the Cooley Peninsula, and elsewhere in the country, throughout the foot and mouth disease crisis. Those difficulties have been particularly acute for the farmers of Cooley who have experienced at first hand what it means to have a confirmed case of the disease in a locality. It is clearly a traumatic experience for farmers and farm families to see entire herds and flocks slaughtered in one fell swoop. While the experience of Cooley was particularly intense, sacrifices were also made by the farming community throughout the country, by sporting and commercial organisations, by many businesses and by the general public, many of whom had no connection whatsoever with the agriculture sector. Happily, it now appears that these sacrifices are paying off and I am certain that no one in this House will question the absolute necessity or appropriateness of the control measures put in place since we were first confronted with the threat on 21 February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 62 days since the only case in this jurisdiction was confirmed on 22 March and on or about 21 June, provided there are no further cases before then, this country will regain its white listed status under World Animal Health Organisation criteria. We can then begin to consider an appropriate timescale in which to allow restocking to commence in Cooley, taking into account the varying risks on infected land and associated land parcels, on commonages, on lowland farms to which sheep were moved from commonages and on other lowland farms in the area. This exercise will be conducted on the basis of the best available veterinary advice and in a phased and controlled manner. Above all, we do not want to rush into restocking in a manner which puts the livelihoods of farmers and others at risk if the virus is still present on the peninsula. Were there to be another foot and mouth outbreak, we would be forced to reimpose in full the <Col N="1515" /> restrictions which have been eased in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of compensation for sheep farmers in the Cooley area whose flocks were culled as a precautionary measure against foot and mouth disease. The policy of my Department in such cases is to pay the market value of the flock, as is legally provided for. However, following representations from the IFA when the cull in Cooley was at an advanced stage, my Department accepted that certain sheep farmers appeared to have a case for review of their valuations. The Department made a commitment that it would conduct such a review along lines which were generally understood. The basis of such a review was a perceived inequity in the valuations of flocks culled, particularly those dealt with early in the process relative to those culled at a later date. In line with its commitment, the Department carried out a detailed review of such cases and concluded the exercise on 14 May. The review comprised an examination of valuations on 286 files, followed by a further investigation of 182 cases where it was established that this was warranted. Valuers were requested to re-examine these files and supplementary payments totalling £415,000, and ranging between an additional £80 and an additional £23,500, were recommended. These recommendations were accepted by the Department.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate it was necessary to conduct this exercise at all, but I am sure Deputies appreciate that, in the context of the emergency which faced my Department and the speed with which it was required to act in these cases, it was inevitable that there would be some anomalies. I am obviously concerned with ensuring the farmers of Cooley are dealt with fairly and the response is evidence of my disposition in that regard.</P>
    <P>A commitment to fair treatment does not, however, imply that my Department should yield to every and any demand which is made in relation to valuations, however unrealistic or excessive. The focus and parameters of the exercise was the market value of the animals which were actually culled and it is important that all concerned recognise this fact. Demands which could not be justified on that basis were from the outset clearly outside the scope of the exercise and it is important that this reality is also recognised. I am satisfied that the valuation review in relation to the Cooley flocks was conducted in a fair, detailed, professional and speedy manner and I now consider this matter closed.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last, 17 May, three days after the review had been completed, officials of my Department met with an IFA delegation and outlined to them the outcome in general terms. Letters are now being prepared for issue in the coming days to each flock owner whose case was <Col N="1516" /> reviewed, informing him or her of the outcome in their own particular case. Arrangements are also being made for issue of the recommended payments to those flock owners in respect of whom supplementary payments were recommended and these cheques will also issue within days. Many, and I hope most, of the flock owners in question will appreciate the way in which the Department responded in this instance to the case made on their behalf for a review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. I do so because of an unsuccessful attempt by an individual to open a betting office in Athenry in County Galway in recent months. It is difficult to understand why the application has not been successful. When this individual applied to the District Court for a suitability permit, he was refused. It appears that while the gardaí were against granting the permit, the main reason given by the court was that if a permit was granted, either the new business or the existing betting office in the town would close in the next six months. I understand the objections of the gardaí have been overruled on many occasions in such matters. The suitability of either the promoters of the exercise or the premises is beyond reproach. I am led to believe that the premises and its facilities are above the normal standards.</P>
      <P>What does the Betting Act, 1931, say about the excessive numbers of betting shops in any given area <i>vis-à-vis </i>the population ratios and trends? There are many questions raised about the commercial basis of the project. Is there a monopoly as far as betting shops are concerned? Why have the towns of Gort, which has approximately the same population as Athenry, Tuam and Ballinasloe got three betting shops? My small home town of Mountbellew has one betting shop. Surely a town of the size of Athenry and its hinterland which is rapidly expanding could support two betting shops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promoters got full planning permission from Galway County Council and a bookmakers' licence was granted. There are more than 2,000 people in Athenry and there is a growing population in the adjoining area. It has 18 public houses and other facilities and it is earmarked for rapid tourism growth. It is difficult to understand why competition has been introduced for betting shops. What weight is given in law to an objection from an existing operator? No other member of the public objected in this case. What does the Competition Authority think about this case? Only two days ago the Government stated that it wants to liberalise the pub trade and pharmacies. What is wrong with doing the same for betting shops? There is a case to be made and I hope the <Col N="1517" /> Minister outlines the reasons behind the suitability criteria.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand I cannot comment on the case because it was a court decision. On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who could not be here with us tonight, I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this matter in the House and for giving the Minister the opportunity to inform the House about this issue.</P>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the procedures for the issuing of bookmakers' licences is the Betting Act, 1931. This Act lays down the procedure which must be adopted by both residents and non-residents in the State when applying for a bookmakers' licence. The Deputy will no doubt be aware that in accordance with section 7 of the Betting Act, 1931, responsibility for the issuing of a bookmakers' licence to applicants who meet the qualifying criteria rests with the Revenue Commissioners. The Deputy will also be aware that the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the issue of licences is in relation to the granting of certificates of personal fitness and certificates of suitability of premises. Certificates of personal fitness for applicants resident outside the State are granted by the Minister while certificates for applicants resident in the State are granted by a superintendent of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Betting Act, 1931, states that any person, other than a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons, who is ordinarily resident in the State and desires to obtain a bookmakers' licence may, after publishing the required newspaper notice, apply for a certificate of personal fitness to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the district in which he or she has or proposes to have an office registered under the Act. If he or she has not and does not propose to have any such office, he or she should apply for a certificate of personal fitness to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the district in which he or she ordinarily resides. Every person intending to apply for a certificate of personal fitness is required to publish notice of his or her intention to make such application at least once in each of two newspapers circulating in the district of the superintendent to whom he or she intends to make such application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A superintendent of the Garda Síochána to whom an application for a certificate of personal fitness is duly made will within 14 days after the receipt of the application either give to the applicant such certificate or refuse to give a certificate. A Garda superintendent may refuse an application for a certificate of personal fitness on any of a number of grounds, such as that arrears of any betting duty are due and owing by the applicant; that the applicant had been previously con<Col N="1518" /> victed of a crime or offence under any Act relating to gaming or betting; that a bookmakers' licence held by the applicant was revoked; that a previous refusal of a certificate was confirmed on appeal to the District Court; that the character of the applicant is such that would make him or her not a fit person to hold a licence; that the financial status of the applicant is such that would make him or her not a fit person to hold a licence and that the applicant had previously failed or refused to pay persons sums payable to persons who had won bets with him or her. A full list of the grounds for refusal are set out in section 6 of the Betting Act. Any person who has been refused a certificate of fitness may lodge an appeal against that decision to the District Court within 14 days of the notification of refusal. Notice of any such appeal must also be given to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána and to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As regards a person who is resident outside the State, the application for a certificate of personal fitness is made directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The procedure for this application is similar to that for an application from a person resident in the State and is outlined in section 5 of the Betting Act, 1931. This section of the Act also provides that the Minister may either grant a certificate that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a bookmakers' licence or may, on any ground and without stating the ground, refuse such a certificate. A person to whom a certificate of personal fitness has been issued may then apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a bookmakers' licence. The application for the licence must be made within 21 days after the issue of a certificate of personal fitness.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that a certificate of suitability of premises is also required before a bookmaker can commence business in any premises. An application for a certificate of suitability of premises is made to the superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the district in which the premises is situated. Any person intending to apply for such a certificate must publish notice of their intention to make an application in each of two newspapers circulating in the district in which the premises are located. There are a number of grounds on which a certificate of suitability may be refused.</P>
    <P>They include the following: the applicant is neither a licensed bookmaker nor the holder of a certificate of personal fitness; the applicant is not the proprietor of the premises; and the premises are in close proximity to a place in or near which large numbers of persons congregate, or situated in a residential area. A full list of the grounds for refusal of a certificate of suitability of premises is set out in section 11 of the Betting Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>As in the refusal of a certificate of personal fitness, a person who is refused a certificate of suitability of premises may appeal the decision to the <Col N="1519" /> District Court. A person to whom a certificate of suitability of premises has been issued may apply to the Revenue Commissioners to have the premises included in the register of bookmaking offices. The application for registration of premises must be made within 21 days after the issue <Col N="1520" /> of a certificate of suitability of premises. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes the information supplied deals comprehensively with the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 May 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if an investigation has commenced into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area pursuant to section 9 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924; if he intends to publish the reports of the earlier investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area; if he has received from the Garda Commissioner the reports completed to date; if so, if they will be lodged in the Library of Dáil Éireann; and his views on whether it is in the public interest that a public inquiry be conducted into these maters and into the manner in which they have been dealt with to date by the Garda authorities.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15109/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered a similar question to the one tabled by the Deputy and I refer the Deputy to my answer to that Question No. 53 of today.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes, I will repeat what I said earlier.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if an investigation has commenced into this matter pursuant to section 9 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>The section in question provided for the commissioner, or any other officer of the Garda Síochána nominated by the commissioner, or for any person nominated by the Minister to hold an inquiry and to examine on oath into the truth of any charge or complaint of neglect or violation of duty preferred against any member of the Garda Síochána. However, the section was repealed by section 4 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and so does not provide a statutory basis for an inquiry.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Dublin Police Act, 1924, as applied by section 18 of Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925 does make it lawful for any person nominated by the Minister to hold an inquiry and to examine on oath into the truth of any charge or complaint of neglect or violation of duty preferred against any member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the 1924 provision is suited to inquiring into specific allegations against an individual member of the Garda Síochána, I am not sure that it would provide an adequate vehicle for a comprehensive inquiry into the complexities of <Col N="1522" /> the Donegal case where there are a variety of issues and individuals involved.</P>
    <P>In any event, the provision is not applicable in relation to conduct alleged in admissible complaints made under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1996 &ndash; Section 15(3) of the 1996 Act refers. As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, complaints have been made to the complaints board against members of the Garda Síochána in the context of this case.</P>
    <P>As I have also said to the Deputy previously, I want to see the truth of this matter determined. I know that this issue has been in the public domain for quite some time. Concerns about the handling of the investigation into the death of Mr Richard Barron appear to have been first raised in correspondence with my predecessor in 1997. I want to see public confidence in the gardaí, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter, restored. The question is how do we best achieve this in an open and transparent way that will achieve the desired results without interfering with potential civil and criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General as to the whether I can proceed with any type of inquiry while civil and criminal proceedings are pending and what the implications would be of such a course of action. While I obviously want to establish what happened in Donegal, I am sure all sides of the House will agree that it would not be acceptable to proceed in a way that would prejudice or jeopardise any of the proceedings which have been instituted or proceedings which might yet be instituted. I will keep the House appraised of developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have already advised the House that a file in this matter, following Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation, has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Following receipt of directions from the DPP, one person  &ndash; not a member of the Garda Síochána &ndash; has been arrested and charged to date. Further directions are awaited in respect of other aspects of the investigation. A number of civil actions relating to the case are outstanding.</P>
    <P>The commissioner is already taking action to restore confidence. The Deputy will be aware that, when the commissioner received the report of the assistant commissioner on the allegations in question, he decided, in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána, to transfer a number of personnel. I have also been recently informed by the Garda authorities that an inquiry under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989 has been initiated by the Garda Commissioner with a view to investigating suspected breaches of discipline by a number of members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division arising from the investigation conducted by Assistant Commissioner Carty.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks if I intend to publish the reports of the earlier investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area <Col N="1523" /> and, in this regard, if I have received the completed reports from the Garda Commissioner. On the latter point, the Deputy will be aware from recent correspondence that I have not seen the investigation file nor would it be normal practice for the Minister to do so. I have, of course, as I have previously informed the House, received a report of the assistant commissioner's investigation from the Garda commissioner.</P>
    <P>Given the various investigations and proceedings ongoing in relation to this matter, I do not believe it would be appropriate at this time to publish any of the reports I have received in the matter nor lodge them in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the truth of what happened in Donegal is established and becomes known to the public, while also ensuring that this is achieved in such a way that no proceedings are jeopardised &ndash; so that justice can be done and be seen to be done.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 198 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person in question has been the subject of a recommendation from the Refugee Applications Commissioner that he be granted refugee status. I am now required in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, to give to the applicant a statement in writing declaring that he is a refugee. However, I am also entitled by virtue of subsection (2) of that section, where I consider that it is in the interests of national security or public policy to do so, to make an order providing that the entitlements normally associated with refugee status do not apply in any particular case. In making any <Col N="1524" /> such decision I would, of course, be subject to the prohibition on refoulement which prohibits me from returning a person to the frontier of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened. These matters are under consideration at present in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provisions of section 21 of the Refugee Act, 1996 empower me to revoke a declaration of refugee status, subject to certain conditions, where the information supplied to the Commissioner was false or misleading in a material particular.</P>
    <P>Since the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner was made on 15 February 2001, certain information has come to light which raises questions in relation to the nationality ascribed to the person in question. A Garda investigation into this matter is ongoing and I will await the outcome of that investigation before deciding on any further action.</P>

      <Quest>the number of unsuccessful asylum seekers who have been returned to their native countries in 2000 and to date in 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the deportation of persons who have had their application for asylum refused and persons whose application for asylum is transferred to another country under the Dublin Convention. The number of unsuccessful asylum seekers who have been returned to their native countries in the year 2000 totalled 147 with a further five transferred under the Dublin Convention. To date in 2001 the figure stands at 101 with a further three transferred under the Dublin Convention. Furthermore, 35 illegal immigrants who did not come through the asylum process were returned to their native countries in the year 2000 with 19 returned to date in 2001.</P>
      <P>I should add that a total of 248 persons withdrew from the asylum process and returned voluntarily to their country of origin in 2000 and 67 have done so to date in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding whether to make a deportation order, each case is considered on its particular merits in accordance with the criteria specified in section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. Those criteria include, for example, humanitarian considerations and representations made on or on behalf of the person. The issue of refoulement as set out in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, is also given full consideration in each case. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Accordingly, the conditions prevail<Col N="1525" /> ing in countries generating asylum seekers are monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have brought forward a series of measures to strengthen and make more effective the deportation process. This includes recent Government approval for a significant expansion of the Garda National Immigration Bureau which will increase the overall strength of the bureau to 69 officers. The Garda National Immigration Bureau, which I established in May 2000, also has indirect responsibility for more than 200 members who are allocated to immigration duties at point of entry throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, a number of investigations are ongoing. Last week the bureau was responsible for the first successful prosecution for trafficking in illegal immigrants under this Act. In addition, increased resources were allocated to accelerate the asylum process. These measures will increase significantly the numbers of deportation orders made and effected without compromising in any way the detailed consideration necessary under statute in each particular case. The effective repatriation of those whose asylum applications have been unsuccessful and in respect of whom deportation orders have been made is essential if we are to maintain the integrity of the asylum process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. Some £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 and is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will acknowledge that this funding represents the most significant investment in child care service provision by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> The Deputy has requested a list of all the capital and staffing grants to child care groups which I have allocated since the start of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. Under the programme there are available capital and staffing grants for community based not for profit child care groups and, for the first time, capital grants for self-employed private providers of child care services.</P>
    <P>Applications for funding under these measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. Completed applications are assessed initially, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Limited. This is followed by an assessment by the Programme Appraisal Committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision. As outlined in the general guidelines for funding measures, applications are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant(s) to implement the project; the level of integration-co-ordination; and the costings-value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, more than £40 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme in the form of grants, capital and staffing, to child care projects. To date, I have approved more than 470 applications for funding to child care services on the ground which will support 14,000 child care places and which will include the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places as a result of funding under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>
    <P>As the list of grant recipients represents 470 projects across the country, I will not detail them here but will make them available to the Deputy in tabular format as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 470 projects approved for capital and staffing grants, I have approved funding of £10.3 million for quality improvement measures such as training, innovative projects, local networks, the childminders' initiative and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. This brings the total funding approved under the equal opportunities child care programme to more than £50 million to date.</P>
    <P>Copies of the general guidelines and the relevant application forms are available from my Departments equal opportunities child care section which can be contacted on a dedicated lo-call line, 1890 20-90-30.</P>

    <P>In relation to the costs to the State of providing accommodation for asylum seekers, the rates payable to the owners of hostels, hotels, guesthouses, convents and other premises in use for full board accommodation is subject primarily, to the prevailing commercial market conditions. In recent weeks, the amounts paid to accommodation providers in respect of properties procured by the RIA are in the range of £140.00 to £175.00 per adult per week inclusive of VAT. For most of 2000, the amounts paid tended to be in the range of £147.00 to £189.00 per adult per week inclusive of VAT. Within this broad range the amount paid to individual centre owners is contingent on the overall standard of the accommodation and the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>In all cases, prior to a property being brought into use by the RIA to accommodate asylum seekers, the owner-operator of that property signs a detailed memorandum of agreement which specifies the minimum standards required for the provision of full board accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>In the case of state owned properties, management companies are engaged by the agency to operate them. Memoranda of agreement are also signed between the agency and such companies setting out the terms and obligations for their operation.</P>
    <P>The Memorandum of Agreement covers issues such as the reception and registration of asylum seekers, the maintenance and care of accommodation and facilities to be provided, and the responsibility of the proprietor-operator to ensure that the property in use complies and operates to all relevant statutory requirements including those relating to fire and public safety.</P>
    <P>All asylum seekers resident in the centres procured by the RIA are accommodated on a full board basis. Full board consists of breakfast, lunch and dinner each day. Snacks, tea and coffee are also available throughout the day. In addition, owners-operators are also obliged under the provisions of the memorandum of agreement to ensure that the menus offered reflect the reasonable needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre; portions of food shall not <Col N="1530" /> be restricted; the manager-proprietor has reasonable regard to the food needs of young infants and children resident at the centre, for example, provision of infant formula, food and heated milk for children; and lunches are provided to each school-going child.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate unit within the RIA conducts regular inspections of each location where asylum seekers are accommodated to ensure that all conditions in the memorandum of agreement are being complied with. Any irregularities which come to light as a result of such inspections are followed up with proprietors, operators or management companies as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The agency has also discontinued its use of a number of properties which did not comply with the requisite standards.</P>
    <P>The following arrangements are in place to meet the health and psychological needs of asylum seekers. Asylum seekers are advised of the health services available to them through the information pack which is provided during their initial stay at a reception centre in Dublin. This pack also advises that further information about health services may be had from the local health boards where they are resettled.</P>
    <P>They are also offered health screening free of charge on a voluntary basis &ndash; the purpose of which is to detect and treat diseases or conditions, in the interests of themselves, their families, and the community generally. It also enables persons with special health needs to be identified soon after their arrival. Where asylum seekers require special medical, psychological or psychiatric services, including services for people who have suffered torture or trauma, these are provided by the health services.</P>
    <P>There is a dedicated team of psychologists based in Dublin which provides services for asylum seekers and refugees. The service is made available on request and a minimum of four sessions are provided to each patient before he or she is resettled in one of the regional accommodation centres.</P>
    <P>Where it is evident that a greater level of psychological input is required the psychologist may recommend that the person remains in <Col N="1531" /> Dublin or close to another centre for continuing treatment. This also applies in the case of asylum seekers requiring specialist medical services and arrangements will be made by the RIA, at the request of the medical professionals, to ensure that the person is accommodated close to the relevant medical service centre.</P>
    <P>There are also four main reception centres in Dublin where asylum seekers are accommodated for up to two weeks prior to their dispersal to provincial centres. These are Viking Lodge, Francis Street, Dublin 8, Parnell West Hotel, Parnell Square, Dublin 1, Harcourt Inn, 27 Harcourt Street, Dublin 2 and Kilmacud House, Upper Kilmacud Road, Co. Dublin. In addition to these, there are also four overflow centres located in Dublin, i.e., The Staircase, Aungier Street, Dublin 8, Horse and Carriage, Aungier Street, Dublin 8, 10 North Frederick Street, Dublin 1, and 14 Gardiner Place, Dublin 1. In recent weeks, the number accommodated in these centres averaged 450 daily.</P>

      <P>Work has already commenced on implementing a number of the report's recommendations. The remaining recommendations cover a wide range of areas which fall within the areas of competency of a number of Departments and agencies, including my Department. Work, based on consultations with other Departments and agencies, is continuing on developing an implementation plan in respect of these remaining recommendations. I expect to submit the plan to Government for approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recommendations concerning the survivors and relatives of those who died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, the work of the independent commission of inquiry into the bombings, the sole member of which is Mr Justice Henry Barron, is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government yesterday approved the provision of assistance to the Justice for the Forgotten group, who are active on behalf of the victims and the relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The assistance will enable the group to establish a family support centre to provide a personal support service to the victims of the Dublin and <Col N="1532" /> Monaghan bombings and other similar atrocities, as well as their relatives. The Government has agreed in principle to provide assistance of up to £162,000 in the current year, with further assistance to be provided subsequently.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 110, 203, 216 and 217 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand and sympathise with the distress which families must face and live with when a loved one goes missing, and I have spoken in the House on many occasions on this subject. As I have indicated before, the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in missing persons cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its <Col N="1533" /> power to locate missing persons and that it provides considerable support to families.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result, substantial changes were made in 1998, such as the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a Garda liaison officer, who deals with a designated family member.</P>
    <P>Garda statistics reveal that approximately 99% of those reported missing in any year are accounted for by the end of that year. It must be realised that most of the people who go missing do not do so in suspicious circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána operates a website which gives details of certain missing persons. While the funding of a dedicated helpline and counselling services for the families of missing persons are not the kind of services that would normally fall within the responsibilities of my Department, I can appreciate why Deputies would advocate the provision of such services and I have asked my Department to consider how this might be brought about either with my own Department's support or through another State-funded agency. Moreover, I understand that health boards may be in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to those members of a declared missing person's family who are identified as being in need of such services. I further understand that the provision of these services is a matter, in the first instance, for each health board, having regard to the needs in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Although there have been no studies carried out of the kind referred to by Deputy Durkan, an analysis of statistics has shown that a significant number of persons go missing near the coast in dangerous locations, such as cliffs, or were last seen on boats or trawlers. Some were also last seen at ferryports, which might be taken to suggest that they went missing of their own volition. The figures also conform, to some extent, to the broad picture emerging from research into suicide, where, in the case of males, for example, incidences of &ldquo;going missing&rdquo; and male suicide cluster in the early 20s and early 40s.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of persons who were untraced at the end of each year, from 1990 to 1999, the last year for which published figures are available, is as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to Priority Question No. 54 today, I am aware that a number of cases from Northern Ireland which were recently decided by the European Court of Human Rights have important implications in relation to the investigation of activities undertaken by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I have indicated that it will be necessary to consider, in detail, a wide range of complex legal and other matters before a final decision can be made on what changes are necessary in this country in order to ensure that there is full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will recall that I have been engaged in a major review of the Garda complaints arrangements generally, including the operation of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, and the question of establishing an independent inspectorate. The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights will, clearly, <Col N="1535" /> be highly relevant to this review which I will complete as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The high level of overtime working in the Prisons Service and the associated costs have been problems for many years. Last year, £38 million was spent on overtime, which is more than half of the basic pay bill of prison staff, excluding allowances. The underlying reasons for this level of additional attendance, which is necessary for the day to day operation of the prisons and to carry out essential escorts of prisoners, do not lend themselves to short-term solutions. The factors involved are complex. Staffing levels and arrangements are the product of operational circumstances which have been in place over many years against a background, at times, of very considerable tension and difficulty.</P>
      <P>This issue was addressed, not for the first time, in the report of the prison service cost review group, which was published in 1997. As a means of addressing the overtime situation in a strategic way, the report recommended the establishment of a dedicated staffing and operations review team, SORT, to assess the man hours required to deliver agreed regime activities and services, and recommend associated systems of staff attendance and deployment practices.</P>
      <P>That team has now completed its work and produced reports on all prisons and places of detention as well as a global report. This global report provides a summary of the team's observations, conclusions and recommendations. Its bottom line is that, given the implementation of the various infrastructural and staffing changes recommended, there are enough staff in the service to run the prisons without the present dependence on overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase of this project &ndash; Strategic Effectiveness Programme, STEP &ndash; moving the Irish Prison Service forward &ndash; started in March last. It entails a joint working party &ndash; a change implementation team &ndash; which comprises four POA officers and four management representatives who will examine how the revised tasks identified in these reports might be undertaken <Col N="1536" /> without the need for overtime working. It will also examine the changes which would need to be made to the management and organisational structure in the prisons. The officers' conditions of service and issues such as the categorisation of prisoners will also be considered. The group have been set a 12 month time scale for their work. This is an ambitious but realistic timescale which reflects the size of the task, the range of change which will be involved and the urgency of the situation in so far as escalating costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>This change process that we are now embarking on will, of course, involve changes to work practices. The development of partnership structures at local level will be an urgent priority so that a vision of the future of the service which is shared by both management and staff can be developed.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, take some time to prepare and implement the fundamental changes that will be involved. The time span for designing and negotiating the blueprint envisages an outline blueprint available in early summer 2001, progress review in autumn 2001, and a completed blueprint available in late spring 2002.</P>
    <P>When the technical aspects of the discussions are concluded, a negotiation team would then concentrate on the methods of implementation and the issues that would arise from a staff perspective. These negotiations will take place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The nature of the implementation and roll out phase throughout the entire prison service which would follow will have to be determined but given the scale of what is being proposed, there will have to be phasing and benefits for staff would have to be linked to this phasing.</P>
    <P>This situation is not unique to this country. Similar overtime cultures developed in neighbouring jurisdictions in recent times and were tackled in a strategic way similar to the process now being undertaken by the Irish Prisons Service.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Director General of the Prisons Service, on behalf of the prisons interim board, both of whom I appointed in mid-1999, that this careful well-planned methodology now being put in place for addressing the problem in a way that is rational has every prospect of addressing the issues once and for all. This rational, carefully planned approach to correcting the situation clearly has merit over the hasty approach, which the passage of years has shown not to have worked. I have emphasised to the prisons service the priority I attach to addressing this issue.</P>

      <P>Every effort is being made by my Department to address the question of vacancies in the Probation and Welfare Service. The Civil Service Commission held a recruitment campaign late last year to fill both existing vacancies and newly sanctioned posts in the Pro<Col N="1538" /> bation and Welfare Service and offers of appointment are currently in the process of being made to successful candidates from that competition. In addition, my Department recently advertised for the recruitment of additional full-time temporary unestablished positions of probation and welfare officer. Interviews for these posts commenced in March and were completed in April of this year and offers of appointment have already been made to the first 50 successful candidates on the panel. Twenty seven of those candidates have already accepted terms of offer of contract and have either taken up duty or have agreed a starting date.</P>
      <P>The number of staff vacancies in the Probation and Welfare Service on 11 May 2001 was 56.5. Since then, 18 new staff have taken up duty and a further 14 new staff are expected to take up duty by 11 June 2001. At the present rate of take up, my Department is hopeful that all existing vacancies in the Probation and Welfare Service will be filled in coming months. It should then be possible for the Probation and Welfare Service to provide a service to the Central Criminal Court in the Hillary Term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Garda authorities have no evidence that children are being trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of exploitation, I am acutely aware that the problem of trafficking in human beings, including children, by gangster type syndicates has become a major problem internationally and a significant facet of transnationally organised crime.</P>
      <P>All persons must be in a position to satisfy an immigration officer of their identity and nationality on arrival in the State and, where an immigration officer believes that an adult travelling with a minor may not be the parent or legal guardian of that child, then further inquiries will be made. In addition, there are specific procedures established under the Refugee Act, 1996 which was commenced in full by me on 20 November, 2000, and which take account of situations where an unaccompanied minor arrives in the State. In such a case an immigration officer is now required to inform the relevant health board and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, apply in respect of the child in question. These controls are an important element in the overall efforts of the Garda Síochána to prevent and combat trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a comprehensive intelligence base and closer co-operation with immigration authorities in other jurisdictions are also essential elements in combating the type of <Col N="1539" /> activity to which the Deputy refers and was one of the main reasons the Government approved the setting up of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 9 May 2000 following consultation with the Garda Commissioner. The bureau has already established effective operational co-operation with immigration and police authorities in other jurisdictions and Garda liaison officers have been assigned to London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on immigration and trafficking matters. The bureau also liaises closely with carrier companies whose routes have been targeted by traffickers. The Government has recently approved the allocation of significant additional resources to the bureau.</P>
    <P>From a legislative point of view, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, made it an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purpose of the child's sexual exploitation, or to provide accommodation for such a child while in the State. The penalty on conviction on indictment for that offence is a maximum of life imprisonment, a reflection of the seriousness of this type of crime. In addition, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, targets professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law. The penalty on conviction on indictment for the offence of trafficking under the Act is an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of resources within the courts system is a matter for the board of the Courts Service. As Minister, I have ensured that the financial allocation to the courts has been substantially increased year by year, from £30.5 million in 1997 to £57.4 million in 2000, which represents an increase of 88%.</P>
      <P>Most judicial separation and divorce cases are heard before the Circuit Court. I am aware that delays do exist in a number of circuits in family law matters, which is a matter of concern. Accordingly, since taking office, I have arranged for an increase in the number of Circuit Court judges by two to 28, which is the statutory maximum. The most recent appointment was made last January.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the business of the Circuit Court is, of course, a matter for the President of the Circuit Court. The increase in the numbers of judges will, however, assist the president in dealing with delays, in so far as these may be attributable to a shortage of judges.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of court statistics is a matter for the Courts Service and I no longer have direct responsibility in this regard. However, I understand that in the year ending 31 July 2000, 1,621 judicial separation applications and 3,346 divorce applications were received by the courts. In the same year, 1,035 judicial separations and 2,623 divorce applications were granted. Despite the steady increase in the number of divorce cases being received by the courts &ndash; 2,761 applications in year ending 31 July 1998, 3,316 applications in year ending 31 January 1999 and 3,346 applications in year ending 31 July 2000 &ndash; the periods leading up to the hearing of applications for judicial separation or divorce have been substantially reduced. Where both parties are ready to proceed, applications for judicial separation or divorce will in most provincial circuits be heard at the next circuit court sittings. In Cork, the corresponding period is two months for consent applications for judicial separation or divorce and 12 months in respect of contested cases. In Dublin, the corresponding period in respect of consent applications is only one month and approximately seven months for contested cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts Service is extremely conscious of the emotional distress and anxiety family law cases can cause for all the parties concerned and <Col N="1541" /> is committed to reducing as far as it is within its control any delays in hearing such cases and in improving the facilities, information and service available to family law litigants. To this end a sub-committee of the Courts Service board has been established to review the current procedure and manner in which family law is dealt with by the courts and to make recommendations for change thereto. A pilot project for the reporting of family law cases has commenced in the Dublin family courts. This will be the first time that such cases will be reported and it is hoped that this reporting will assist in future planning for the needs of family law litigants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 108 and 192 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The finding in the report that 78% of prisoners placed in padded cells are suffering from mental illness is largely based on the comments and observations in prison registers of the use of such cells. Most of these entries, which are brief and situation related, are made by prison officers who <Col N="1542" /> are untrained in assessing or diagnosing mental illness. The classification by the trust's report of such cases as &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; in this report is unscientific and does not represent the true figure.</P>
    <P>I do, however, accept that an increasing number of vulnerable and mentally disordered people are being committed to prison. In this regard prison is used as a place of last resort by the courts for some mentally disordered people who may be charged with offences of a public order nature. It would be beneficial if more spaces were available to treat such prisoners, either in the Central Mental Hospital or elsewhere. I understand that there is a review under way at present by the East Coast Area Health Board on the future service role of the Central Mental Hospital and I am awaiting the outcome of that review.</P>
    <P>The proposal that prison inservice clinics should be developed in Mountjoy, Castlerea and Cork prisons is, in my opinion, contrary to the thrust of the report that imprisonment and mental disorder are incompatible. Successive Governments have taken the view that if a prisoner is psychiatrically assessed as in need of psychiatric treatment, that treatment ought to be provided in a psychiatric hospital. That policy conforms generally to the policy in other European jurisdictions and to the policy advocated by the relevant organs of the Council of Europe. However, the recommendations contained in the Irish Penal Reform Trust report, including those referred to above, will be carefully considered. The Director General of the Prisons Service, in this context, met a deputation from the trust last week and they discussed their report and recommendations with him at some length.</P>
    <P>Provision for an inspector of prisons is being made in the context of the Prisons Bill which is under preparation in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>Prisoners have a number of avenues open to them to make requests or complaints. They have access to staff, the governor, the visiting committee, my Department and the courts. Prisoners may also write to the European Commission of Human Rights and-or the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, CPT. In addition, they may meet with Department officials on request to discuss any issue of concern. In the circumstances I see no need at present to provide for an ombudsman for prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated and which came into effect on the 6 July last, provides for a considerable strengthening of the law on underage drinking. The Act takes into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which reported on the whole area, including those recommendations which related to underage drinking. I also took into account the many submissions received from groups and members of the public following a consultation process.</P>
      <P>With a view to strengthening those provisions which already existed in legislation of 1988 in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons, I abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licence holder, increased the fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking and provided for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to underage persons. The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; defence is complementary to the voluntary age card scheme which I introduced in April 1999 in that it makes reliance on the age card scheme by licensees more important. No defence is permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an underage person.</P>
      <P>The age card scheme allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his/her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2 has overall responsibility for the issuing of the cards. The cards have security features, which include a hologram, incorporated into their design. I am happy to say that to date, in excess of 25,000 age cards have been issued, and applications are being received at the rate of 200 per day.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting the scheme, I launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities who have taken the following steps to promote the use of the age card. All Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters. Non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters. A poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night-clubs and dance halls, etc., youth information centres &ndash; youth groups nationwide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support. Garda juvenile liaison officers-community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects etc. highlighting the age card scheme. There is ongoing liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochána and new avenues to ensure young people get the age card message are being explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> The national age card scheme, and the special measures I have taken to promote it, will assist in combating the scourge of underage drinking.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department also provides funding for a total of 51 Garda youth diversion projects nationwide with the aim of diverting young people from becoming involved in anti-social behaviour and from coming into conflict with the law.</P>
    <P>Through a combination of prevention and intervention programmes, projects aim to facilitate personal development and civic responsibility in the participants as well as improving Garda-community relations. Programme contents may contain a constituent element advising young people of the dangers associated with alcohol and substance abuse.</P>
    <P>My policies in relation to combating the drugs problem are well known: tough legislation backed by strong law enforcement in tandem with an integrated partnership approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage. This combination has resulted in significant drug seizures, major Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and local communities becoming actively involved in dealing with problems in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The Garda is tackling both major drug trafficking groups and street level drug dealing, as well as dealing with the international aspects of drug trafficking. The major trafficking groups are constantly being targeted and a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made. Garda operations such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap continue to prove effective in targeting on street dealing and the distribution of drugs in nightclubs and licensed premises. Provisional figures for 2000 indicate that the Garda made almost 7,000 arrests under these programmes last year alone.</P>
    <P>The problems of underage drinking and substance abuse must also be addressed outside the context of law enforcement and legislation. My Department continues to play its role in the development of the national drugs strategy and both my Department and I are represented on the various structures that have been established to implement this strategy. This ensures that we continue to contribute to the development of integrated policies to tackle drug misuse at national and local level.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in ensuring that all institutions of State are working together in implementing an integrated approach to the drugs problem through initiatives such as national drug strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the integrated services process. I am satisfied that these measures represent a balanced approach to the problems posed by drugs and drug addiction at local level. Measures to reduce the demand for drugs are vital in order to ensure that young people, in particular, are made aware of the danger of drugs and are given worthwhile and tangible alterna<Col N="1545" /> tives to prevent them from falling into a cycle of drug misuse and crime.</P>
    <P>Fourteen local drugs task forces, LDTFs, have been established in priority areas identified as having the most acute drugs problem, namely, Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Bray, canal communities &ndash; Rialto, Bluebell, Inchicore, Clondalkin, north east Dublin &ndash; Coolock, Darndale, Donnycarney and Kilbarrack, Dublin 12 &ndash; Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown and lower Crumlin, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Finglas-Cabra, north inner city, south inner city, and Tallaght.</P>
    <P>A review of the national drugs strategy has just been completed and was launched on 10 May 2001. The primary aims of the review were to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy and to develop revised strategies and necessary new structures through which to develop them, to ensure that policies and strategies in this area remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 sets out a series of objectives and key performance indicators under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. A number of recommendations in relation to co-ordination are also made.</P>
    <P>The review of the national drugs strategy identified LDTFs as an important element of the overall response to the drug problem. Their principal strength is that they allow local community and voluntary groups to work hand in hand with State agencies in responding to drug misuse in the areas most affected by the problem. The review concluded that the setting up of the LDTFs has been a positive development and they are generally regarded as an effective mechanism for tackling drug misuse at local level. Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, it is proposed to extend the task force model to other parts of the country, through the establishment of regional drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking and substance abuse are also addressed in the context of health promotion generally. The National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 has set out clear aims and objectives on the topic of avoiding drug misuse. It is the policy of the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children to realise these objectives in partnership with the health boards or other relevant bodies. This will ensure that each health board has in place a comprehensive drugs education and prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>However, it must be said that while legislative measures and law enforcement, together with initiatives such as the projects mentioned can help to curtail the problem of underage drinking and substance abuse, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the underage drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone &ndash; in particular, parents, teachers, politicians, the drinks industry, and the creative media must also <Col N="1546" /> play their part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the location of law centres, rests with the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Mount Street premises was the original head office for the Legal Aid Board and that this premises was retained by the board as a law centre when, arising out of an increase in staff numbers, its head office moved to its present location in St. Stephen's Green House in October 1994. I am informed that the board decided to retain the Mount Street premises, on a temporary basis, as a law centre pending the selection of a premises for a city centre law centre which had been approved on 4 March 1994 by my predecessor, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who had responsibility for civil legal aid at that time. I am informed that the board propose to effect the relocation in the autumn of this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to arrangements for the present clientele of the Mount Street Law Centre, the Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, an applicant for legal services may apply to any law centre in the State, regardless of his or her home address. In this regard, law centres serve no particular catchment area and applicants from the greater Dublin area may apply for legal services at any of the Dublin law centres convenient to them.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the present clientele of the Mount Street Law Centre come from a variety of areas of both the north and south of Dublin city and county and that only 37 out of 442 people who are current clients actually live in what might be regarded as the Mount Street area. For the Deputy's information, I have included details of the postal districts where those clients live.</P>
      <P>I should also mention to the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board operates a private practitioner scheme. Under this scheme applicants are given the option of either going to a private solicitor of their choice from the panel of private practitioners or of having their names added to the waiting list at the law centre. I am informed that there are solicitors from the south city and south county area on the panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> In relation to arrangements for the staff of the law centre, I am advised that the staffing complement at Mount Street consists of five solicitors, one part-time, one law clerk and five clerical officers. I understand that while the board will require the solicitor-in-charge to transfer to the new centre in the Smithfield area, the other staff will be offered the choice of moving to one of the board's law centres in the Dublin area. I understand that the board will shortly be discussing arrangements for the relocation with the staff representatives.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can inform the Deputy that, in view of his interest in this matter, I have requested the board to examine the needs of the Dublin south east area, as part of its ongoing review of the delivery of legal services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>I refute any contention that the manner in which I have dealt with asylum seekers has contributed to the growth of racism.</P>
      <P>In accordance with our international obligations as a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol, the Government is committed to ensuring that asylum applications are processed speedily, having regard to fairness and due process, so that those who are genuine refugees secure protection with the speed they deserve and that those whose claims are unfounded are identified in an effective, fast and fair manner.</P>
      <P>Asylum policy generally is multifaceted and it follows therefore that the formulation of public policy, and its subsequent implementation, requires a substantially different response in the cases of a refugee, an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant.</P>
      <P>It is essential, however, to ensure that those who are found to be genuine refugees are fully integrated and enjoy all of the rights that go with that status and that immigrants generally, irrespective of their status or whether they happen to be here illegally, have their human rights fully respected and are not allowed to become the subject of criminal or racist attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the law makes a legal distinction between a refugee, an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant, that does not mean that the State is at liberty, in dealing with one category of <Col N="1549" /> immigrant, a refugee, to apply the highest international standards but, in dealing with a different category of immigrant, an economic migrant, to apply an inferior standard.</P>
    <P>The point in maintaining the legal distinction is to ensure that the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; which is contained in the 1951 Geneva Convention is not devalued and to maintain the integrity of the arrangements in place to control immigration. Its purpose is not to produce discrimination against any category of immigrant and it is the policy of the Government that all classes of immigrants whether illegal or otherwise will be treated fairly, humanely and in accordance with principles which respect their human dignity.</P>
    <P>The recent Amnesty International campaign calls on the Government to enact and enforce anti-racism legislation, to establish an independent monitoring body for racist incidents and attacks, to promote anti-racism training, and to implement an anti-racism public education programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has already enacted one of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination codes in Europe. The Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000 outlaw racial and religious discrimination in employment, training, accommodation and the supply of goods and services. Moreover the legislation established a free and effective system of enforcement through the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
    <P>As regards the monitoring of racist incidents and attacks, the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations monitor complaints of racial discrimination as part of their remit. The Garda racial and intercultural office is currently working on a definition of a racial crime that takes into account the views of victims in order to facilitate the recording of such incidents by the Garda Síochána. In addition, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI, recently set up a confidential system for reporting of racist incidents by victims.</P>
    <P>The NCCRI has for several years organised anti-racism training for public and private bodies. It is surprising that Amnesty International has not referred to the dedicated work in anti-racism training by the NCCRI. The Equality Authority and the Garda racial and intercultural office have also been actively involved in promoting anti-racism training in their respective fields.</P>
    <P>There have been positive developments against racism in the school curriculum and in adult education, anti-racist initiatives in the prison service, and support for measures to assist relationships with Travellers, such as the citizen Traveller campaign and for the Traveller mediation service.</P>
    <P>Work on the implementation of the anti-racism public awareness programme is under way. The steering group implementing this programme is made up of representatives of community and voluntary groups and ethnic minority groups, most of them active against racism <Col N="1550" /> in Ireland for years, the social partners and Departments under an independent chairperson. However, anti-racism awareness is not only a matter for Government, as Amnesty International would seem to imply. Experience elsewhere shows that media campaigns alone have a temporary and limited effect. To change attitudes on the ground requires the combined resources and commitment of all sections of society. It also requires local and community initiatives. For this reason, the high level steering group's first initiative is the launch of a grants scheme for local and community initiatives to combat racism on the ground which was advertised today in the national newspapers.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 9(2) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which was commenced in full by me on 20 November 2000 an immigration officer is obliged to give leave to enter the State to any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State seeking asylum. This requirement, which is in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, applies notwithstanding the fact that the person in question might not otherwise fulfil the necessary conditions for admission to the State due to inadequate documentation, insufficiency of funds etc. Consequently, all such persons enjoy a temporary entitlement to remain in the State until their asylum applications have been concluded and have thus entered the State legally.</P>
      <P>The majority of applicants for asylum do not, however, apply at ports of entry. Inland applications are a feature of asylum systems throughout Europe. In 2001, approximately 67% of applicants to end April made their application at the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in Mount Street, Dublin. Precise statistics are not available on the percentage of those applicants who would have been granted permission to enter the State by an immigration officer for some other purpose prior to attending at the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. However, very few produce evidence of having obtained such permission. In any event, all such persons, upon making their application for asylum, thereafter enjoy a temporary entitlement to remain in the State by virtue of section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996 until their applications have been finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unaware of any court order which requires all patrons entering a particular premises to carry identity cards. The position is that the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated and which came into effect on 6 July last, provides for a considerable strengthening of the law on underage drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to strengthen the provisions which already existed in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons, I increased the fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking, abolished the defence of <Col N="1552" />&ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licensee, and provided for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to underage persons.</P>
    <P>The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence places a greater onus on the licensee to ensure that intoxicating liquor is supplied only to those who are legally entitled to purchase or consume it on licensed premises. No defence is permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an under-age person. Where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person is upheld, a licensed premises will be the subject of a mandatory temporary closure order. The purpose of the temporary closure provision is to provide a strong deterrent to abuses of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>The national voluntary age card scheme, which I initiated by way of regulation in April 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. The scheme is intended for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises and who wish to do so. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In this way, the scheme is designed to assist both consumers and licensees. I believe that this scheme, coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, is proving an effective deterrent against under-age drinking. I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a mandatory scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the policies I have implemented since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have resulted in a major crackdown on organised crime. Strong legislation specifically designed to target organised crime has been introduced, backed up by tough law enforcement measures. I have, for example, put in place the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. This Act has also introduced a range of new measures designed to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those who are assisting the gardaí in the investigation of an offence and their families, and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for such offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced while in Opposition, has been successfully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activity from enjoying the benefits of their ill-gotten gains. This legislation and the operations of the Criminal <Col N="1553" /> Assets Bureau have received much praise both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>On the law enforcement side, specialised Garda units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the national bureau of criminal investigation have been established to tackle organised crime, seize assets of organised criminals and bring them before the courts.</P>
    <P>The successes of these units are well documented and I think it would be useful to refer briefly to them at this point. Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 2000 the bureau has obtained section 2 interim orders on property to a total value of over £8 million and section 3 interlocutory orders on property to a total value of over £7 million, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded over £37 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to over £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>From 1998 to 2000 seizures of illicit drugs amounted to an estimated street value of over £132 million and the money laundering investigation unit of the Garda bureau of fraud investigation received almost 4,500 suspicious transaction reports with a value of over £590 million. In addition, special measures such as the witness security programme have been developed in order to prevent criminals from intimidating those who assist the authorities in bringing criminals to justice and has been used successfully to date in organised crime investigations.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties facing all law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime is the fact that these criminal organisations are now operating at an international level and are flexible enough in their operations to take advantage of any new opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, the response to organised crime must be an international one.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates fully in the fight against organised crime at both EU level and beyond. At EU level, a range of measures from the 1997 EU action plan on organised crime has been agreed, with the intention of improving co-operation between national law enforcement agencies in order to tackle international organised criminal groups more effectively. Following on from this action plan a new EU strategy for the prevention and control of organised crime for the beginning of the new millennium has been adopted. International agencies such as Europol and Interpol have an important role to play in dealing with international organised crime and the Garda is in regular contact with these agencies through the Garda liaison officers posted to Europol and Interpol headquarters.</P>
    <P>In December 2000, I signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland, the United Nations Convention against transnational organised crime and two protocols to the convention: the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in per<Col N="1554" /> sons, especially women and children and the protocol against smuggling of migrants by land, air and sea.</P>
    <P>The legislative and law enforcement measures which have been introduced have been recognised as a major step forward in the fight against organised crime in Ireland and have resulted in the dismantling of major organised crime gangs and the imprisonment of a number of significant criminals.</P>
    <P>I believe that our legislation is among the most effective in Europe when it comes to combating organised crime and this is in fact well recognised by our EU partners. However, that is not to say that there is any complacency on my behalf. In this context, I am constantly evaluating our response to organised crime and I can assure the Deputy that whatever steps are necessary will be taken to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>Both the Prisons Service and my Department are resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse in the Prison System in a comprehensive way. In addition to the introduction of measures to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons, the prisons service will continue to seek to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>
      <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved in 1999 advocated a broad general approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This included the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services was central to this recommended approach which built on a medical policy which had been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in this area. It sought to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request the director general of the Prisons Service then established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior Prisons Service management, probation and Welfare Service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted its first report to myself in <Col N="1555" /> July 2000, and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. This report recommended the following three pronged strategy: the appointment of a drug treatment co-ordinator for the Dublin prisons; the recruitment of drug treatment specialists in the counselling, psychological and medical fields; a training programme led by an assistant governor to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with drug treatment prisoners.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. A series of meetings have been held since November 2000, between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Health and Children and the Prisons Service and health boards.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions, the position of co-ordinator of drug treatment services, prisons, identified in the steering group's report, was advertised recently by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The co-ordinator's responsibilities will include the co-ordination and management of the delivery of drug treatment services in prisons located in the Eastern Regional Health Authority as well as promoting best practice on throughcare in respect of drug dependent persons entering and leaving those institutions. While the filling of this position is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, I understand that this process is now at interview stage and that every attempt will be made to fill the post at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that, following consultation with the Department of Finance, I expect the Prisons Service and the health boards to be very shortly in a position to commence the recruitment process for the other drug treatment posts recommended in the steering group's first report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. The sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision and <Col N="1556" /> quality throughout the country. This, as I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge, represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>The initial allocation to my Department of IR£250 million under the national development plan has since been augmented by further funding under the anti-inflationary package for child care and the transfer of funding for school age child care from the Departments of Social Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science. The transfer of funds follows a recent Government decision to rationalise child care funding and move towards what is in essence a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for funding available for child care providers. The funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006 and is targeted at services which offer daycare facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The overall aims of the programme are to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community based &lsquo;not for profit' child care organisations. Capital grants for small scale self-employed or private providers catering for no more than 20 children were also made available for the first time. In October 2000, I was pleased to announce that capital grants are now available to private providers who cater for more than 20 children. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, childcare training and innovative projects.</P>
      <P>Applications for funding under these and other measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. All applications will be dealt with in an identical manner and all applications should be made to my Department whether it is for a crèche facility or an after schools project and whether it is on school premises or in a community centre. Completed applications are assessed initially, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Ltd. This is followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision.</P>
      <P>Applications are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project, the level of integration/coordination and the costings/value for money of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1999 the Government assigned responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery to my Department. Since then, my Department has established co-ordinating structures on a national and local level in line with the <Col N="1557" /> recommendations of the expert working group on child care. These co-ordinating structures are designed to support effective co-ordination and an integrated approach to future development of child care which takes account of the diversity of needs at local and national level. These co-ordinating structures include: a national co-ordinating child care committee to oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in an integrated manner throughout the country and county child care committees to advance the provision of child care facilities within the local area.</P>
    <P>The Government's national child care policy has assigned county and city child care committees as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality child care. The county and city child care committees are charged with the responsibility for the effective inclusion of child care needs within the county and city development plans being drawn up by the county and city development boards. The county and city child care committees will work closely with the county development boards in this regard. Each committee will develop a county and city child care plan which, will cover the direction set out by each committee based on a shared vision and analysis of the needs within each city and county area.</P>
    <P>Because child care training has developed in Ireland in an unstructured fashion a certifying bodies subgroup has been established to develop a national qualifications and training framework in child care. The framework will address qualification, certification and accreditation issues in the child care sector from foundation to third level. The framework, when completed, is to be submitted for consideration to the National Qualifications Authority in Ireland. It will assist in providing for progression routes and recognition of the child care role as a profession. The process includes consultation with the public through seminars which have been hosted nationwide.</P>
    <P>Invitations have recently issued to interested groups in relation to the establishment of a working group on school age child care. This working group will look at developing quality guidelines for school age child care as well as make proposals on the development of school age child care services on an all year round basis. The inaugural meeting of the working group, which will be chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is scheduled for 7 June 2001 and the group is due to report by October 2001.</P>
    <P>The progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care supply in Ireland. Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding in excess of £40 million to over 470 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. To date, over 14,000 child care places will be supported by this funding which will include the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places. <Col N="1558" /> The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, I have approved funding of £10.3 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the childminders initiative and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities child care programme to over £50 million to date.</P>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda and show that this Government is delivering on its commitment to treat child care as a priority area for investment. I am satisfied that my Department is making this vital investment in an effective and strategic manner and that the equal opportunities child care programme of my Department is making a real difference to the families of Ireland. The strategies I have outlined, including both the funding measures and co-ordinating structures build on existing structures and will be further developed over the course of the national development plan.</P>

      <Quest>the steps being taken to reduce waiting time for consultation with a solicitor at each of the legal aid centres; the progress made to date regarding financial eligibility under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15016/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of legal services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to combat the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times in law centres, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board this year when I increased the allocation of grant aid to £13.7 million. This represents an increase of 6.21% on the 2000 allocation.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the board is at present engaged in a recruitment campaign to fill all solicitor vacancies throughout its law centre network. As regards the recruitment of solicitors, the Deputy will be aware that there is a huge buoyancy in the Irish economy at present and employment opportunities for law graduates are now far more extensive than has hitherto been the case. In this context, the Legal Aid Board, in common with employers generally, has to compete for candidates in an increasingly competitive market in order to fill vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand from the board that a review of practices and procedures in law centres is being undertaken to seek to improve efficiency. The board considers that this review will lead to an increase in the throughput of cases <Col N="1559" /> and the provision of services to a greater number of persons. I should also mention to the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board operates a private practitioner scheme. Under this scheme applicants are given the option of either going to a private solicitor of their choice from the panel of private practitioners or of having their names added to the waiting list at the law centre.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that I recently obtained sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, to extend the scope of the private practitioners scheme to include cases in the Circuit Court. The Deputy will be aware that this scheme previously covered certain cases in the District Court, and was extended on a nationwide basis in May 2000. I expect that this initiative will be of considerable assistance to the board in its efforts to provide legal services to applicants within a reasonable amount of time. I might add that the sanction also provides for an increase in fees, which will make this scheme more attractive to private solicitors.</P>
    <P>In relation to those applicants waiting for legal services, I should point out to the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care and cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. In 2000, approximately 27% of the board's clients received appointments immediately.</P>
    <P>The following tabular statement shows the longest waiting times in April 2000 and April 2001 at each of the law centres.</P>

      <P>I am currently considering the recent view expressed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee that the State had failed to demonstrate that a decision to try an individual before the Special Criminal Court was based upon reasonable and objective grounds, and that this constituted a violation of the right under Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to equality before the law and to the equal protection of the law.</P>
      <P>This view raises difficult and complex issues, and I will need to carefully consider these in consultation with the Attorney General before I bring to Government proposals for a response to the Human Rights Committee. It is also the case that a committee, chaired by the former Supreme Court Judge, Anthony Hederman, is currently reviewing the Offences against the State Acts, and I will of course take into account any advice I might receive from it on the matter.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, in November 2000, I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes, with the approval of the Government. The terms of reference of the Commission are as follows: to review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society; to review, in particular, the scope for a system of additional licences; to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population and tourist areas; to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out; to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition; to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate; to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes to give effect to the recommendations put forward; to submit a report within three months of the first meeting on paragraph 3 of its terms of reference and a final report within two years of the first meeting on all other matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The audit which the Deputy refers to is entitled &ldquo;Ireland: An audit of compliance with international human rights standards 2000&rdquo; published recently by the Irish section of Amnesty International. The audit in question deals with a range of issues including asylum and focuses on, <i>inter alia</i>, the degree to which the State protects the right to seek asylum against the benchmark of applicable international human rights law and standards.</P>
      <P>I totally reject the analysis contained in the audit to the effect that aspects of our asylum law and procedures fail to comply with international human rights standards. Much of the analysis in the audit is selective and does not fully recognise the major efforts which have been taken by me to ensure that we have in place a comprehensive body of law and support arrangements to ensure that asylum applications are processed in a fair and transparent manner and in line with best international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> The Government places a high priority on maintaining an asylum process which is both fair and transparent in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 convention and which is geared towards providing protection to those in genuine need of such protection as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides a strong foundation for meeting Ireland's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention to which the State is fully committed. The 1996 Act, which compares very favourably with legislative provisions internationally, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000 and drafted in full consultation with the UNHCR. The Act, which places the procedures for processing applications for refugee status on a statutory footing has resulted in the establishment of two new independent statutory offices to process asylum applications namely, a Refugee Applications Commissioner who makes recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to whether a person should be granted or refused refugee status and a Refugee Appeals Tribunal consisting of individual independent members to deal with appeals against negative recommendations of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and a chairperson whose role is to allocate work and develop a system of quality control, as well as hearing appeals.</P>
    <P>The scope of the 1996 Act is wide ranging dealing as it does in a comprehensive manner with first instance decisions, appeals, right to legal representation, right to interpretation and providing specifically for a direct contribution to be made by the UNHCR to the determination process. Considerable resources are expended annually to ensure that our procedures are in line with the best international practice and the highest standards and the application of these procedures have been affirmed by the courts on several occasions.</P>
    <P>I am at present providing additional resources to the various parts of the asylum process with a view to speeding up processing times and strengthening the refugee legal service which provides legal advice to asylum seekers at all stages in the process.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the specific areas of concern in relation to the asylum process referred to in the audit and the audit's main recommendations I would make the following comments. On access to interpretation, including gender specific interpretation, the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides that interpreters will be provided where &ldquo;necessary and possible&rdquo;. This wording is not intended to be restrictive, rather, it places the highest possible onus on the authorities to provide an interpreter, while allowing for the rare and exceptional case where a person refuses to co-operate. The implication of deleting &ldquo;possible&rdquo; is that it would be a statutory requirement to provide an interpreter even where it was impossible thereby creating an unworkable provision. An asylum interview cannot be held unless <Col N="1565" /> the interviewer and the asylum applicant can communicate and under no circumstances can a substantive decision be made on an application for asylum without an interview being held. Both the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal operate policies of providing interpretation at all interviews or hearings where requested and of providing gender specific interpretation where appropriate. Interpretation will always be provided where practicable and possible having regard to the fact there are currently in excess of 100 nationalities represented in the asylum system and that for certain languages there is a limited number of interpreters available in the State.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive training is provided to staff working in the asylum process. Staff are trained to deal with applicants for asylum in a sympathetic manner and with respect and sensitivity and a full awareness of cultural differences. This training includes procedures to be followed when dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence. All staff working in the asylum area including the reception and interviewing personnel have completed appropriate training courses and have received &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; experience of interviews and assessments. Training programmes are agreed with UNHCR and delivered by a combination of the Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full time official here.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive range of research sources, electronic and printed material, are available to authorised officers involved in interviewing and assessing applications for a declaration as a refugee. This information is updated regularly.</P>
    <P>An independent documentation centre has also been established under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board and its role is to maintain a collection of objective and up to date country of origin information and asylum, immigration, legal and human rights documentation and to make this information accessible to all those involved in the asylum process, for example, decision makers in the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and legal representatives of asylum seekers as well as those with a research interest in refugee and asylum issues.</P>
    <P>With regard to the application of the principle of non-<i>refoulement</i>, I would point out that the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which absolutely forbids the sending of a person &ldquo;in any manner whatsoever&rdquo; to a place where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or opinion. This overarching principle is the bedrock of Ireland's repatriation framework and is vigorously applied in order to meet our obligations under both domestic and international law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> While the asylum process seeks to ensure that those who are genuinely in need of protection receive that protection as quickly as possible, it is also important that in order to protect the integrity of our process, sanctions are also in place so as to ensure that abusive and fraudulent applications do not clog up the determination process with the consequence of delaying the identification of genuine refugees. The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, contains provisions similar to those existing in other EU states relating to the detention of asylum seekers in certain specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>The provisions exist as an aid to immigration officers or members of the Garda and their application is a matter for the Garda who are experienced in this area. I would point out, however, that the Act contains comprehensive safeguards to protect those detained. In addition, general principles for detention are set out in the Refugee Act, 1996 (Places and Conditions of Detention) Regulations, 2000. I would reiterate that asylum applications in Ireland are processed in accordance with procedures agreed with the UNHCR and are based on the highest standards of international practice.</P>

      <P>A commitment has been given in the Government's legislative programme to publish the disabilities Bill in 2001. It is my intention that the disabilities Bill will be a positive action measure to advance and underpin the <Col N="1568" /> participation of people with disabilities in society. A broad-ranging consultation process on the Bill involving organisations and agencies associated with the disability sector took place in the latter part of last year. With this process completed, work on the development of proposals for the legislation is ongoing. I continue to welcome views concerning the possible content of the Bill from all quarters.</P>
      <P>The measure I propose will be broad in scope and ground-breaking in nature and clearly requires a considered approach, given the cross-sectoral impact of the measure proposed. The Deputy will appreciate that the qualitative approach I have adopted will require the input of time and effort and that any lesser commitment on my part would be to short-sell people with disabilities. I have not made any secret of the broad thrust of the Bill and the areas of activity which are under consideration, including access to public bodies, use of telecommunications services, use of transport and participation in the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>In view of the comprehensive consultation process that has already taken place and the fact that I have outlined the broad thrust of the measures which are under consideration, I would not intend to engage in a further consultation process at the heads of Bill stage. Ample opportunity will be available to consider the detailed provisions of the Bill when it is published and in the course of its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The disabilities Bill will be the fourth legislative measure in the area of disability equality sponsored by this Government and has been progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructural framework for equality which the Government has put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000 prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including the ground of disability, in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. The Equality Authority and director of equality investigations, established to implement this legislation, are now fully operational. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency dedicated to disability policy and practice and is also fully operational. The disabilities Bill will build on and complete this framework for equality.</P>
      <P>99.<b> Mr. Rabbitte</b> asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when it is expected that the promised immigration and residence Bill will be published; if he will consider discussing the heads of the Bill with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in view of the importance of the matters likely to be dealt with in this Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The most recent review, in 1998, was carried out in the context of an EU review of member states, compliance with an EU joint action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. That joint action is now the subject of further review by the EU. To date, no changes in the law have resulted from these reviews. Nevertheless, some time ago I announced a further review of the legislation in my Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 221 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to ensure that fully adequate accommodation is available for the Garda Síochána. While this is a difficult task, in view of the large number of stations involved and <Col N="1570" /> the fact that some of them were built before the foundation of the State, every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to ensure a high standard of Garda premises throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In that context a considerable investment has been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years. Since 1998, in excess of £51 million has been allocated in the Office of Public Works Vote for capital works to Garda properties. In addition, in the same period, just under £21 million has been allocated in the Garda Vote for necessary maintenance works to Garda properties.</P>
    <P>For my part, this House can be assured that I will continue to secure the maximum level of resources I can for the Garda building programme. Any difficulties that may arise in relation to individual stations will be resolved through co-operation between all the relevant parties, including the Garda authorities, the representative associations, the Office of Public Works and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent survey carried out at University Hospital Galway. However, although there is no doubt that the staff at accident and emergency departments perform a demanding job in treating those who suffer injuries, they are not trained crime investigators. For instance, it would not be a straightforward matter for such staff to distinguish victim from perpetrator, as the tendency of perpetrators is to claim victim status.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is generally accepted across jurisdictions that a certain proportion of crime goes unreported, although there is no evidence to maintain that the level of unreported crime in Ireland has either increased or decreased in recent years. Although I would always consider it to be in the best interest of each individual who is the victim of a crime to report the matter to the Garda Síochána, the reasons for non-reporting are many and complex, and they are not as amenable to resolution as the Deputy seems to suggest.</P>
      <P>For example, in 1999, the Central Statistics Office published the report, Quarterly National Household Survey: Crime and Victimisation, which detailed responses to queries about crimes against individuals and households. The survey found that the percentage of crimes reported to the Garda Síochána varied according to the type of offence. Respondents failed to report the crime involved for a number of reasons, including, for example, the belief that the crime was not serious enough or that they had solved it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> It must also be pointed out that self-report studies, such as victimisation surveys, are not by their nature comparable with Garda statistics. The Central Statistics Office itself noted that its survey results &ldquo;. . . are not directly comparable with crime statistics published in the Garda Síochána annual report, as there are fundamental differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology.&rdquo; As a consequence, the various techniques for gathering data, including hospital surveys, should best be considered as potentially indicative rather than direct comparables.</P>
    <P>In relation to the questions concerning street violence I would refer the Deputy to my answers to today's Questions Nos. 109, 209, 211, 212 and 222. Finally, I would reiterate that, owing to the lack of comparable studies, there is no reason to believe that the level of unreported crime has increased in recent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy are published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent year for which they are available is 1999. Although data for the year 2000 have not yet been finalised, I understand that provisional Garda figures for the year indicate an increase in the number of rapes, which is, of course, a matter of concern. In this context, I recently commissioned and launched a research report entitled &ldquo;Attrition in Sexual Assault Cases in Ireland: A Qualitative Analysis&rdquo;, which describes victims' interaction with various parts of the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resulting recommendations have implications not only for a number of areas of that system but also relate to wider social, health, education and media issues. I can confirm that I have referred the report and its recommendations to the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, for further consideration. <Col N="1573" /> The Deputy will be aware that any change in the prosecution of sexual assault cases is a matter for consideration by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is entirely separate from and independent of my Department.</P>
    <P>However, I have taken action on delays which have existed in the processing of cases in the Central Criminal Court and at a number of Circuit Court venues. I obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional High Court Judge, who took up duty in February 2000. I also recently published the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a further increase by one in the statutory number of High Court Judges. Furthermore, I obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court, and this appointment was made in January 2001.</P>
    <P>I understand the President of the High Court, in order to deal with the increase in the number of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court, has increased the number of judges sitting in that court to four and that consideration is being given to the allocation of a fifth judge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The 1997 programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drugs court system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the working group on a courts commission and also the report of the expert drug court planning committee, which I established, the pilot drug court programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January, 2001 and the first sitting took place on 16 January. The court sits on Tuesday and Thursday at 3.00 p.m. at the Richmond Courthouse and each sitting is preceded by a meeting of the drug court team and the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug court pilot programme marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and <Col N="1574" /> is designed to test this important alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. The pilot programme, which will be run for a period of 18 months, is being evaluated by expert consultants who were appointed following a public procurement process. The success of the pilot programme depends on the development of an integrated cross service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes. The merit of implementing a drug court programme on a national basis will be considered following the completion and evaluation of the pilot project in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 109, 209, 211, 212 and 222 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;street violence&rdquo; does not readily correspond to any category of crime used by the Garda Síochána in the compilation of its annual reports. However, under a number of sections of relevant Acts, between October 2000 and March <Col N="1575" /> 2001, the number of detected offences roughly corresponding to aspects of street violence amounted to 38,896. These include more than 16,000 offences of intoxication in a public place.</P>
    <P>The main legislative provisions relevant to street violence are contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 and the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990. These statutory responses are being kept under continual review by my Department.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo; has been deployed in cities and large towns since October 2000. I understand from the Garda authorities that, as part of this operation, each divisional officer compiled an operational plan which incorporated all initiatives and operations to combat public order problems and illicit drug use. I am further informed that additional plans to focus on public intoxication and under-age drinking were also developed.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider the operation to have been highly successful to date, and I understand it has received favourable comment from both the general public and the business community. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and nightclubs. In this regard, the Garda Síochána continues to visit licensed premises to impress an even greater awareness of their responsibilities on the licensees. I am further informed that, in Dublin, the new corporation by-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor on public streets have proven very effective.</P>
    <P>In relation to offences committed by juveniles, I am confident the Children Bill, 1999 which is currently before the Oireachtas, will have a significant effect on public order offences committed by young people. The Bill contains specific proposals on the responsibilities of parents. For example, parents may be obliged to take measures to remedy whatever it is that has caused them to lose control over their children. On a related note, I have also overseen a dramatic increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 51 at present.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as the House may be aware, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, significantly strengthened the provisions against the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor to underage persons. To complement this, the age card scheme, which I launched last year, allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the House that the national crime council is undertaking a major research project in relation to public order offences, which should significantly enhance the information available to us about the nature and patterning of this problem. In addition, the Garda Commissioner has brought together people to provide <Col N="1576" /> expert advice on the particular factors which appear to be at work in the manifest tendency towards serious violence in certain instances amongst young people.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the responses of my Department and the Garda Síochána to the issue are comprehensive and appropriate, and I am satisfied that they are and will continue to produce positive results. Statistics for previous years relating to the range of offences which may constitute &lsquo;street violence' can be found in the annual reports of An Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent annual report details crime statistics in relation to 1999.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The manpower strength, all ranks, in the division on 1 January 1998 was 440. I am assured that Garda manpower assigned to Donegal division is continually monitored and reviewed.

The situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of the Donegal division will be fully con<Col N="1577" /> sidered by the Garda authorities within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 194 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputies falls into two categories, namely, voluntary returns and consent to deportation. In the case of a voluntary return, a person advises my Department that they wish to withdraw from the asylum process and leave the State voluntarily. In such cases no financial assistance is given to the person in <Col N="1578" /> respect of their return arrangements. However, if the person is residing outside the Dublin area my Department would, if necessary, accommodate them to facilitate easy access to the airport, and provide travel vouchers for their journey. The person must pay for their own flight and supply my Department with the relevant flight details. The flight must be one way only and the ultimate destination must be their country of origin or a country which they can prove that they have permission to enter.</P>
    <P>In the case where a person consents to deportation to their country of origin, flight arrangements are made on their behalf and are paid for by the Department. If they are not in possession of a valid passport and are unable to obtain same due to their country not having an embassy in Ireland, they are then issued with a travel document. If the person is residing outside the Dublin area my Department would, if necessary, accommodate them to facilitate easy access to the airport, and provide travel vouchers for their journey. In both cases identity papers are returned to the person at the airport prior to their departure.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he intends to take to ensure greater compliance by Government Departments with Government guidelines relating to gender balance in regard to appoint ments to State boards or bodies in view of the fact that so many are failing to meet the 40% quota; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that more progress is made towards reaching the target of a minimum of 40% of both men and women on State boards. My Department is reviewing the matter at present and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly.</P>
      <P>The background to the 40% target is that guidelines in the form of a Government decision taken in March, 1993 were issued to all Departments. The Government decided that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. These guidelines were extended in March, 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature etc.</P>
      <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and keeps the situation under review. The figures for membership of State boards on 31 December, 2000, show that 28% of the total serving membership were women. This figure needs to be broken down between persons nominated by Ministers and those nominated by others. In the case of ministerial nominees, 34% were women. In the case of nominees by other bodies, 21% were women. Women comprised 18% of chairs of boards. With regard to appointments made over the year 2000, 36% of the persons nominated by Ministers were women and 24% of those nominated by other bodies were women.</P>

      <Quest>his response to the recent report, Crime Control in Ireland: The Politics of Intolerance, which found that while current policies had led to a significant increase in the number of people charged with such offences as begging, prostitution and public order offences, there was no evidence of any serious pursuit of white collar crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the report in question, Crime Control in Ireland: The Politics of Intolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> Begging and prostitution together constituted only approximately 0.2% of total non-indictable offences recorded in 1999 and any suggestion that it is policy to concentrate on pursuing these offences to the detriment of pursuing more serious offences is neither borne out by the statistics themselves nor has any basis in reality.</P>
    <P>With regard to white collar crime, there are already wide ranging powers under common and statute law to obtain search warrants; enter and extensively search business premises; and arrest, detain and interrogate suspected persons. Moreover, the Deputy will be aware of my Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage. The Bill, which takes into account the report of the Law Reform Commission on offences of dishonesty and the report of the advisory committee on fraud, sets out to comprehensively and radically reform the law on white collar crime, fraud and offences of dishonesty in general. The Bill is a clear example of my determination to pursue all forms of crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Garda response to this matter, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation has national responsibility for the investigation of serious and complex fraud-related crime, including cases of commercial fraud, cheque and credit card fraud, computer fraud, money laundering offences and counterfeit currency. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the bureau commences investigations when they become aware that a breach of the criminal law has occurred, by reaction to complaints received and by initiating investigations aimed at targeting particular groups, practices or areas.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the Garda Síochána has agreed to the secondment of members to both the new office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition Authority. These bodies have responsibility for the enforcement of the Company Law Acts and the investigation of criminal cartels, respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 March 2000 the Government agreed with my recommendations for the establishment of a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, called the Reception and Integration Agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the new agency is operating on a non-statutory basis. The decision to establish the Reception and Integration Agency follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The Reception and Integration Agency is the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment facilitates a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. The agency has responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of services for both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government in 1999. The agency, like its predecessor, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, will continue to function on a cross-agency/departmental, multidisciplinary basis. In that regard, in addition to my own Department, staff assigned to it are drawn from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Defence Forces and the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> I have also recently appointed an interim advisory board to the new agency. This board is chaired by Mr. Raymond Rooney and has 15 members made up of seven members of the wider community and one representative each of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Finance as well as the director of the Reception and Integration Agency on an <i>ex officio</i> basis. The inaugural meeting of the board took place on 3 May last.</P>
    <P>While it would be premature at this stage to set out in precise terms the nature or content of the legislation to be put in place in respect of the agency, I can confirm that my thinking is that it would be along similar lines to that which underpins other agencies and services in the wider justice, equality and law reform area. Moreover, the interim advisory board should also be afforded an opportunity to consider and to bring forward its views on this matter in advance of any decision on it by the Government.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to self-employed/private providers and not community based-not for profit groups. It is open to self-employed/private providers to apply for a capital grant under the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06 which is operated by my Department. A sum of £344 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-06 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital grants currently available under the equal opportunities child care programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000. Under the programme, capital grants of up to £40,000 were made available in April 2000 for the first time for self-employed/private child care providers who cater for no more than 20 children at any one time for the purchase, building, renovation or <Col N="1583" /> upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of child care equipment. The schemes in place are kept under constant review. For example, I announced in October 2000 that capital grants of up to £40,000 would be provided to larger private child care providers for the purchase, building or renovation of child care facilities and for the purchase of child care equipment. Budget 2000 also provided improvements to the capital allowances in relation to the costs of construction, refurbishment or extension of premises.</P>
    <P>To date, I have allocated funding of £2,508,259 to 112 self-employed child care providers catering for no more than 20 children at any one time at an average grant rate of £22,395 per applicant. In addition, I have allocated funding of £518,630 to 18 larger private providers at an average grant rate of £28,813 per applicant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to unspent money in my Department, there will be no unspent money for child care as spending is taking place over a seven year period with a total allocation of £344 million available over the seven years for child care. Not only will there not be unspent money but what is invested in child care will be spent carefully and strategically.</P>
    <P>The original allocation of £250 million for child care purposes under the national development plan has been supplemented by Exchequer investment of £94 million giving a total allocation of £344 million to be expended by my Department to end 2006. This, as the Deputy will acknowledge, represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda is targeting credit card fraudsters, conducting searches, making arrests and instigating proceedings against offenders on a regular basis. The Garda bureau of fraud investigation &ndash; GBFI &ndash; is the specialist agency within An Garda Síochána with responsibility for the investigation of fraud related crime on a national basis. A special unit &ndash; the cheque-credit card fraud unit &ndash; within the GBFI participates in prevention awareness programmes throughout the country with business watch groups, chamber of commerce and hotel groups, in an effort to highlight fraud trends and offer advice for combating this form of criminal activity. This unit also participates in an All-Ireland fraud forum, which includes law enforcement agencies and credit card companies from both north and south of the Border, to discuss recent fraud trends and methodologies for countering them. Meetings are also held between this unit and the Irish Credit Bureau, which has a membership of over 30 credit lending institutions in Ireland, on a quarterly basis to discuss issues relevant to fraud. It also liaises with the individual credit lending agencies on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>A fraud alert booklet was published by the GBFI in partnership with Pricewaterhouse Coopers and made available to all business-retailers throughout the country. Over 20,000 booklets have been distributed to date. Members of the GBFI also attend joint meetings held in Europol and Interpol with credit lending agencies and law enforcement agencies throughout Europe regarding non-cash means of payment.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill which was published in 2000 and is currently on Committee Stage includes new offences to cover such areas as fraudulent conversion and obtaining by false pretences as well as modernising the law relating to forgery and counterfeiting.</P>

I am sure that the House will appreciate the difficulties that the Garda Síochána faces in investigating these cases, as there is no crime scene available for analysis and, hence, there is a complete lack of forensic or pathology evidence. Each of the cases under review by Operation Trace was originally investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance. Operation Trace has comprehensively reviewed each of these cases and has yielded new lines of inquiries which have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. Furthermore, a unique database has been devised which facilitates the cross referencing of information generated by each case. While progress has been slow and time-consuming, the Garda authorities consider that the operation has been worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities is one to which all EU member states would subscribe. This concept has been published in a communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, on 12 May 2000. The communication, entitled, Towards a Barrier Free Europe for People with Disabilities, outlines what it sees as the way forward in eliminating barriers to the participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of social life. Since taking office, the Government has sought to remove barriers to progress in the area of equality for people with disabilities. As Minister with responsibility, I have taken steps to ensure that such barriers are removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of mainstreaming is central to the removal of barriers which impede progress in the <Col N="1588" /> area of equality for people with disabilities. Mainstreaming means the delivery of services for people with disabilities by the public bodies charged with the provision of that service for the general public. Full and equal participation in society by people with disabilities is now recognised as a right and I have introduced the necessary legislative and administrative infrastructure to enable this right to be exercised.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in the workplace on nine grounds, including disability. This legislation is now being implemented through the Equality Authority and Office of Equality Investigations which came into operation in October 1999. The Equal Status Act, 2000, prohibits discrimination in the supply of goods and services on the same nine grounds as the Employment Equality Act, including disability, and will also operate through the Equality Authority and Office of Equality Investigations.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provides for the establishment of the NDA as a focal point for disability policy and implementation of standards in services provided for people with disabilities. In this regard the NDA is currently taking steps to promote the principles of the Barcelona Declaration which calls upon local authorities to ensure good design for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Each of these provisions forms an essential element in the new equality infrastructure within which mainstreaming is taking place. Mainstreaming services for people with disabilities will ensure that the requirements of all our citizens, and not just some, will be met. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government is committed to advancing policy development in relation to equality for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government is committed to introducing a disabilities Bill. It is proposed that the measures covered in the Bill will be proactive in nature and will require all Government Departments and State agencies to participate in initiatives to advance and underpin the inclusion of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>There is no legal requirement for petrol companies to inform my Department of price increases for petrol. I am therefore not in a position to give any detailed information on the reasons for the <Col N="1590" /> changes that have occurred. However, the Department of Public Enterprise has informed my Department that OPEC members have cut oil production, and that this factor alone could cause increased prices for petrol. The situation could be accelerated by difficulties in the American market where several oil refineries have been closed for maintenance and others closed permanently due to their inability to meet environmental safety standards. This has led to a perceived shortage on the US market with a consequential ripple effect on the world market. In addition there has been a considerable appreciation of the dollar against the euro over the last few years, which causes the euro prices to rise over time. All this has been compounded by the up swing in the Asian market and a consequential increase in demand for petrol. My Department has been informed that it is the interplay of these factors that affects the cost of petrol.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I gave a detailed answer in the House on Tuesday, 15 May 2001 to a question nominated for priority on the background to this whole issue.</P>
      <P>The position is that isolated radioactive segments from decommissioned mortars are currently stored in steel bins in Clancy Barracks in a special radioactive materials storage facility. This facility is constructed in accordance with international requirements for the storage of such items and comes under the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland or RPII for audit and inspections. The facility is operated in strict accordance with RPII guidelines. The storage of the material in this facility presents no danger to military personnel. The material will remain in this facility in Clancy Barracks until a new one is built in the new Defence Forces logistics base in the Curragh.</P>
      <P>It is mandatory for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to maintain a register and inventory of all radioactive substances and to be licensed by the RPII in that regard. The Department and the Defence Forces meet all the requirements of the RPII. The Defence Forces have carried out a full audit of the ordnance materials and systems under its control and none present any hazard from radiation.</P>

This essential epidemiological risk factor was taken into consideration by the veterinary inspector when issuing the restriction notice in accordance with Council Directive 98/46/EC.

      <P>The foot and mouth crisis has highlighted the disease control risks that attach to widespread movement of animals. It has also underlined the need for continuous monitoring of animal movement. In that context, the EU Commission, in consultation with the standing veterinary committee, has taken a number of decisions to restrict the movement of animals of species susceptible to foot and mouth. Nationally, in determining the extent of restrictions necessary on animal movement, I have been assisted by the advice and recommendations of the expert review group.

      <P>In so far as sheep are concerned, they may be moved to slaughter plants either directly or through approved assembly centres. They may also be moved short distances between different fragments of the same holding on animal welfare grounds. Given the difficulties associated with the detection of FMD in sheep, I do not consider that the time is yet right to extend the scope of the permitting arrangements in regard to movement of this species. I will, however, keep the matter under close review.</P>

      <P>All applications received by my Department under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme have now been cross-checked with the cattle movement monitoring system or CMMS.

He was advised by letter of 24 April 2001 that these animals were now rejected and that in fact he had been overpaid a total of £4,557.90 under the scheme as no premium is payable where the rejected animals exceed 20% of the eligible animals. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department, within 14 days, with any additional information which may be of benefit to his case.

It is expected that the selection committee will arrive at conclusions within a short timeframe, having regard to the terms of <Col N="1598" /> the Commission's formal approval when received. I will then make a report to Government and the appointment of the appropriate number of groups will be decided by Government. The programme will be administered by my Department and the selected rural development groups will be contracted to deliver the programme. Funding will be allocated to the groups concerned. The groups will be required to work to detailed operating rules drawn up by my Department in consultation with the EU Commission.</P>

Within this country cattle may be bought and sold for slaughter or further production or moved within fragments of the same holding, provided specified precautionary measures and permitting systems relative to FMD are observed. I have also asked the marts to propose protocols for consideration by the expert group covering the assembly of groups of cattle for onward transfer to a single destination. In addition, sheep and pigs may be sold for slaughter. There are also arrangements in place to facilitate the movement between different fragments of the same holding of sheep and pigs on animal welfare grounds. I am keeping the matter under close review on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>In the initial processing of this application for payment, an issue was identified relating to title to land and the file was selected for a compliance check including an on-farm inspection. The applicant was requested to provide some documentation relating to title <Col N="1599" /> to lands. This documentation was received on 26 February 2001 and the title issue has been resolved to my Department's satisfaction. The on-farm inspection was delayed because my Department had to suspend farm visits from 22 February to combat the threat of foot and mouth disease. The restriction on farm visits was lifted as and from 11 May 2001, and an official of my Department will be in touch this week with the applicant to arrange a visit. If everything is found to be in order, payment will issue as soon as possible after the visit.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance and the Civil Service has led the way in introducing family friendly policies in the workplace. In the Department of Finance, and throughout the Civil Service, staff can avail of a wide range of family friendly working arrangements. The available initiatives are: flexi-time, job sharing, term-time working, career breaks and paternity leave. It is hoped to introduce a work sharing scheme shortly which will significantly widen the range of part-time working options available to staff. Civil servants are also entitled to the benefits of the statutory schemes such as maternity, adoptive and parental leave.</P>

I also understand that the applicant made contact with the board recently requesting that the respite care grant be paid for 1999.

      <P>The senior staff nurse post is a new post which was created as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike in 1999, and the earliest date on which a staff nurse could have been appointed to such a post was 5 November 1999.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland concerning the report of the commission on public service pensions and the 1999 nurses pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government intends to make formal decisions on the recommendations of the commission on public service pensions following <Col N="1603" /> detailed consideration of the report which was published on 31 January 2001. The Government will then move to establish the working group, provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation of the relevant Government decisions. The working group will comprise representatives of the public service unions, relevant Departments, and other appropriate bodies.</P>
    <P>The commission's recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions &ndash; the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations, such as the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland, individual public servants, and pensioners, as well as the taxpayer. For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report.</P>
    <P>When publishing the report, the Minister for Finance commented on the commission view that its recommendations represented an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the measures in the report as a whole. As he stated then, he expects this to be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>
    <P>It would therefore be inappropriate to address specific issues in isolation at this stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1999 nurses pay settlement, the standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply. The Retired Nurses Association's concerns relate specifically to the senior staff nurse post, and to red-circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre-night sisters and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement. The senior staff nurse rate does not however apply to pensioners who retired prior to 5 November 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the red circled allowances referred to above, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date &ndash; 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where (a) actual moneys have been paid, and (b) contribution in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>These issues have been raised by the Nursing Alliance and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency. In this context, my Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that the approach being taken is consistent with public service pensions increase policy. My policy adviser, accompanied by officials from my <Col N="1604" /> Department's nursing policy division, met with a delegation from the association on 9 May 2001 and explained the position to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children fully supports a family friendly working environment. We provide a number of family friendly working arrangements which the Deputy has mentioned. The following schemes are available to staff within my Department. Flexitime is available for staff up to and including the grade of HEO. Flexible hours of attendance are available around two core attendance times of 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. to 4 p.m. Agreement has recently been reached with general council to extend the current flexible working bands of 8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. in recognition of commuting difficulties and other commitments of staff; my Department will shortly introduce the wider bands. Up to 11.5 hours credit may be worked up in a particular flexi period and carried forward to the next period and taken as leave. The number of staffing members using the flexi system is approximately 400 at present.</P>
      <P>The job sharing scheme allows staff within the Department to work half the normal weekly hours of attendance. Normally a job sharing partner is required but this is not essential. We endeavour to facilitate everybody who seeks this work option. The number availing of this service is 62 at present. The job sharing scheme will shortly be enhanced to operate as the Civil Service worksharing scheme, allowing for up to 28 different work patterns, further supporting a family friendly working environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Term time leave has been available in my Department since the summer of 2000. Term time leave allows staff to take either ten or 13 weeks unpaid leave from June until the end of August. <Col N="1606" /> To be eligible the civil servant must have a child or children, up to 18 years of age, be acting in <i>loco parentis</i> or be the primary carer of a person with a disability who needs care on a continuing or frequent basis. The number of staff availing of the service this summer is ten.</P>
    <P>At present, some staff members of my Department are availing of parental leave. Leave of up to 14 weeks for each child born since December 1993 is available to parents or guardians. Many different work patterns are used to avail of the entitlement, for example, four day week, three day week, mornings only or week/s at a time. My Department is flexible to whatever patterns are requested and sanction is given in all cases. The number of staff who have availed of this leave to date is 27.</P>
    <P>Career breaks may be taken for periods from between six months and five years. A career break may be allowed for child care or domestic reasons, educational purposes or travel abroad. An officer availing of the career break scheme may not take up paid employment within the State. An officer may take a career break of up to three years for self-employment where there is no conflict of interest with their position in the Civil Service. The number availing of this scheme is 23 at present.</P>
    <P>The Department offers the usual statutory entitlements which are in existence to all staff including maternity and adoptive paid and unpaid leave, parental leave as above and paternity leave.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of public health concerns regarding telecommunications masts and antennae, he has carried out any survey or investigation as to health problems from telecommunication masts and antennae; if he has been in communication with the director of telecommunications regarding the number of antennae here; if the director of telecommunications has carried out any examination as to the volume of the signal from such antennae; if he or his Department has discussed with the director of telecommunications health hazards from telecommunication masts and antennae; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a proliferation of telecommunication masts and antennae here; his views as to the likely dangers to public health from them; and if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that in parts of Australia such masts and antennae have been banned in residential areas due to the possible dangers to health.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any surveys or investigations carried out as regards possible health problems from telecommunications masts and antennae. With regard to the number of masts and antennae here and their proliferation, this is a matter for the <Col N="1607" /> local planning authorities who are responsible for approval for the erection of masts in a particular area and I have not been in contact with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation about the numbers of these masts.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of emission levels from telecommunications masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and that office publishes an audit report of licensed telecommunications operators each year. Telecommunications companies operating here are required to have measures in place to ensure compliance with the general public exposure limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP. From time to time my Department has referred inquiries regarding possible excessive emission levels from telecommunications masts to the office of the telecommunications regulator.</P>
      <P>As regards possible health risks from telecommunications masts, a number of studies and reviews on the question of health and safety have been carried out internationally. I am advised that the World Health Organisation has assessed the many scientific reviews of possible health effects associated with radio frequency fields associated with mobile phone telecommunications systems. The WHO has stated that none of these reviews have concluded that exposure to radio frequency fields from mobile phone transmitter masts causes any adverse health consequences. Research in this area is ongoing and medical officers in my Department keep up to date with developments.</P>
      <P>Guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to all local authorities in relation to the location of masts recommend that, where possible, free standing masts should not be located in residential areas or beside schools. Should evidence emerge of a significant risk to public health from emissions from telecommunications masts, I would seek to have appropriate remedial measures put in place by the relevant Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>The modernisation of the Civil Registration Service is a joint programme of work between my Department and the Department of Health and Children aimed at introducing a modern civil registration service. The modernisation programme will involve legislative reform, design and development of new processes and procedures and the introduction of modern technology. The consultation document, Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st century, was published in order to let people know how it is proposed to modernise the service and to give them an opportunity to comment on the proposals. My Department has no plans to introduce a universal identity card &ndash; in the way in which this term is generally understood &ndash; either as part of the civil registration modernisation programme or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in the context of the Government's REACH initiative, is developing a public services card which will streamline present arrangements where each public agency issues its own card. This public services card will be supported by all public bodies. The purpose of the <Col N="1613" /> card will be to enable the holder to authenticate their identity in a convenient manner when accessing public services.</P>

      <P>The person in question is in receipt of a maximum rate widow(er)'s contributory pension of £102 per week. The maximum rate of the old age contributory pension is £106 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for widow(er)'s contributory pension are more flexible than those applying to the old age contributory and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify for payment using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a <Col N="1614" /> person may use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. The higher rate of payment of old age contributory and retirement pension traditionally recognised the more difficult qualifying conditions associated with those schemes.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitment to pensioners and as announced in budget 2001, I decided to increase the widow(er)'s contributory pension for recipients aged 66 years or over to the full old age contributory pension rate over two budgets. The special increase of £12.90 per week which took effect last month is the first step in this process.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a widow's contributory pension on 27 February 2001. No decision has yet been made in this case as the deciding officer is awaiting the outcome of inquiries relating to her late spouse's self-employment contribution record. On completion of these inquiries, a decision will be made and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to a widow's non-contributory pension was also examined. She was awarded this pension at the maximum weekly rate of £85.50 effective from 6 April 2001 plus a fuel allowance of £5 per week.</P>
      <P>A payable order book was issued to Swinford post office on 10 May 2001 and the person concerned was advised of this. Due to circumstances outside the control of my Department, the order book was not delivered to the post office. Arrangements were then made to issue a replacement book to Swinford post office on 21 May 2001. This book should be available for collection on 23 May 2001. The Department regrets any inconvenience caused by this delay.</P>

The Act under which this committee functions requires the Revenue Commissioners since 1995 to compile a list of names, descriptions and values of heritage items donated under the legislation and to publish this list in their annual reports which are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The hen harrier is listed under annex 1 of the Birds Directive 79/49/EEC which imposes an obligation on member states to protect and provide for special measures for conservation of wild birds. The birds directive was transported into Irish law by the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, and the hen harrier is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. It is an offence to hunt, disturb or destroy the hen harrier, its nest or its eggs. While no specific sites have been proposed for designation for the hen harrier under the birds directive &ndash; special protection areas, or the habitats directive &ndash; special areas of conservation, this species benefits indirectly from the sites proposed for designation in Ireland under both EU directives.</P>
      <P>Breeding hen harriers were surveyed nationally in 1998-1999. A supplementary survey in two poorly known parts of the range in 2000 and 2001 is ongoing. The total number found by the end of the 2000 field season was 89 confirmed and probable and 25 possible breeding pairs. Almost all pairs bred in the south midlands and south-west of the country. Only 6% of confirmed pairs bred elsewhere in counties Donegal and Monaghan. Numerically the most important hill ranges are the Mullaghareirks-Stack's where there are 29 to 36 pairs, the Slieve Aughties which has 11 to 18 pairs, the Slieve Blooms which have ten to 11 pairs, Slievefeelim-Silvermines which has seven pairs, Ballyhouras which also has seven pairs, and the Kilworth and Knockmealdowns which have five and seven pairs. Other areas held five pairs or less. The 1968-72 breeding population of hen harriers for all Ireland was 300 breeding pairs. Since then although the species has declined in numbers and its range has contracted some recovery has taken place in recent years.</P>
      <P>Hen harriers show a fairly wide choice of nest site and their main requirements seem to be for a dry site, well hidden in tall vegetation. During the survey nests were found in unplanted heathland, newly planted conifers, young second generation conifer plantation and in deciduous scrub growing in gaps and ride lines within conifer plantations. Suitable nesting opportunities are likely to be widespread. The increase in afforestation in recent years has provided increased habitat for the hen harrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, commenced a study in 2000 to provide information on the relative importance of upland habitats during the breeding season. The first year's data indicated the most strongly selected habitat to be new pre-thicket plantation, followed by unplanted heather. Further work is necessary to understanding breeding season habitat requirements and to inform decisions on designating specific sites for the species' conservation. This work, originally <Col N="1617" /> planned for 2001, has regrettably been deferred because of the foot and mouth disease until 2002.</P>
    <P>The hen harrier is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. It is an offence to hunt a hen harrier and to disturb and destroy the hen harrier, its nest or its eggs. The hen harrier is also a designated species under annex 1 of the EU Birds Directive 79/49/ EEC which provides for special measures to maintain a favourable conservation status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement on immigration matters between Ireland and Nigeria which was approved by the Government on 27 March 2001 and which it is my intention to sign as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, provides a mechanism for the repatriation of a person in respect of whom a decision to deport has been made. The agreement itself has nothing to do with a decision to deport.</P>
      <P>In line with usual practice in relation to such agreements, the text will be made available as soon as signature takes place. Thereafter, as this is an international agreement which will involve a charge upon public funds, its terms must, under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, be approved by Dáil Éireann in order for it to be binding on the State. Provision is made in the agreement that it will not come into force until Ireland and Nigeria notify each other of completion of domestic procedures required for its entry into force. I will table the necessary resolution in the House at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the agreement were outlined in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 23 of 12 April 2001 and 503 of 1 May 2001. The agreement will replace the present <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with the Nigerian authorities for the return of their nationals who are residing illegally in the State and will provide an agreed mechanism and structured framework for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in Irish law which requires me to make inquiries after a person has been deported in relation to the position of that person. On the contrary, the position is that such inquiries must be made in advance of the deportation and any such decision is subject to review by the courts.</P>
      <P>In the context of the determination of an asylum application at first instance and at the appeals stage, detailed inquiries are carried out on the basis of comprehensive country of origin information, which is updated on an ongoing basis, by both the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as to whether an applicant for asylum has a well founded fear of persecution having regard to the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Immigration Act, 1999 sets out in a transparent way, the principles, powers and procedures governing the deportation process. These principles include a requirement that the person be given a 15 day period within which to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made. Even if representations are not made I am required to have regard to a range of 11 different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether or not a deportation order should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> Lastly, but most importantly the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 which absolutely forbids the sending of a person &ldquo;in any manner whatsoever&rdquo; to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This overarching principle is the bedrock of Ireland's repatriation framework and cannot be circumvented by the provisions of a repatriation agreement to which the State becomes a party.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the procedures of any such agreement, including the Nigerian agreement, cannot be invoked in an individual case in advance of the foregoing provisions of national legislation being applied. It is also open to a person who is not satisfied with the manner in which national legislative provisions have been applied to challenge the validity of any deportation order made by way of an application for judicial review in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 and legal aid is available for that purpose. Some 85 such cases involving Nigerian nationals are before the courts at present.</P>

      <P>The allocation to the prisons Vote for 2001 is £230.6 million. Of this sum, £25.4 million is for the probation and welfare service giving a net total of £205.2 million for the Prisons Service proper. As of 18 May, 2001 the Prisons Service had a bed capacity of 3,671. The weekly cost of keeping an offender for 2000, the most recent year for which figures are available, came to £1,135 per offender. The cost of keeping an offender is calculated by measuring the current running costs of prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders over a certain period of time, in this case 2000. These running costs include certain items which are fixed regardless of the number of prisoners in custody, such as officers' wages and items such as lighting and heating.</P>
      <P>When looking at the cost of keeping an offender it should be borne in mind that the figure for keeping a person in custody with all of the entailed costs, such as medical, educational and recreational costs, is applicable for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. It is therefore not readily comparable with other types of institutions. It is much less costly to apply a non-custodial sanction, involving supervision of the offender in a community setting, but it has to be borne in mind that non-custodial sanctions are simply not a suitable or adequate way of dealing with many offenders who come before the courts.</P>

      <P>The family-friendly options available in my Department include flexitime, job-sharing, career breaks and term time &ndash; from June 2001. Part-time work is available in a limited number of positions. There are currently 1,925 officers in my Department availing of the various family-friendly work options. The attached table sets out the details requested.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to be proactive in the implementation of future family friendly schemes introduced by the Government. In my capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have taken a number of initiatives in relation to family-friendly policies. I amended the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 on 8 February 2001 to give effect to the budget announcement in relation to increased entitlements to maternity and adoptive leave. As a result of the amendments, entitlements to paid maternity and adoptive leave have been increased by four weeks with effect from 8 March 2001 and entitlements to unpaid maternity and adoptive leave have also been increased by four weeks with effect from that date. A father's entitlement to leave in the event of the death of the mother around the time of the birth or adoption has also been increased.</P>
      <P>The increases in maternity leave have come about as a result of the recommendations of a working group, set up by my Department to review and improve maternity protection legislation. The group was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and the PPF and comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Government Departments and agencies. The working group's recommendations to increase maternity leave were fast-tracked ahead of other recommendations to ensure women could benefit from the increase as quickly as possible. Primary legislation will be required to give effect to some of the recommendations of the working group. Work has already commenced on the primary legislation.</P>

    <P>Adoptive leave was not within the remit of the working group, but the Government decided that, in the interests of equality, the increases in maternity leave recommended by the group <Col N="1624" /> would also apply to adoptive leave. In accordance with a requirement under the Parental Leave Act, 1998 and a commitment in the PPF, my Department in consultation with other relevant Departments and the social partners is conducting a review of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>A research project by the Centre for Gender and Women's Studies, Trinity College, is being co-funded by the EU Commission and my Department. It will identify the key issues concerning the reconciliation of work and family roles, with particular emphasis on how to involve men in family and domestic activities. The research will include a focus on attitudes of men and women as workers and as parents and social policies designed to address these issues.</P>
    <P>My Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. EU and Exchequer funding comprising £344 million has been allocated to my Department over the course of the national development plan between 2000 and 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The initial allocation to my Department of £250 million under the NDP has been augmented by further funding under the anti-inflationary package for child care and the transfer of funding for school age child care from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science. The transfer of funds follows a recent Government decision to rationalise child care funding and move towards what is in essence a one stop shop for funding available to child care providers.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the equal opportunities child care programme are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national level. Capital grants are available to community based groups and private child care providers while staffing grants are available to eligible community based not for profit organisations. In addition, grants are available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, local child care training models, innovative projects and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. My Department is represented on the national framework committee for the development of family-friendly policies which has been established under the PPF. As part of its programme of work, the committee organised family-friendly workplace day on 1 March 2001.</P>

    <P>Garda personnel assigned to these districts, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. I have been assured that Garda authorities will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in these districts, with <Col N="1627" /> a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Ashbourne, Lucan and Naas districts will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the availability of PULSE systems. The overall position is that PULSE systems are fully operational at 181 locations which include divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. At the same time, training for the systems has been undertaken for members in other stations who also have the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly. It is generally accepted that major computer systems are extremely expensive and that is why it has been decided, for the moment, to restrict the number of stations where PULSE is directly available. This is a situation that will be kept under review in the light of the availability of resources and the overall development of the systems.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department have very recently visited the school to which the Deputy refers. As the school is housed on two separate sites, any major refurbishment project will entail a significant amount of planning in order to deliver the high quality, accessible facilities required in this case. The process of formulating such a plan is ongoing in my Department. In the meantime, however, every effort is being made to attend to all essential works requiring immediate attention.</P>

      <P>Both second level schools in Banagher, La Sainte Union secondary school and St. Rynagh's vocational school, require significant capital expenditure to provide up to date facilities. In the circumstances and having regard also to declining demographic trends in the area, my Department decided to examine the possibility of a single school development in the town.</P>
      <P>Following a series of meetings between officials of the planning section of my Department and the trustees of the schools concerned, there is general agreement on the need to amalgamate the two schools. Agreement has not been reached on a management model for the proposed school, but the trustees have indicated their willingness to have the appropriate model decided by the Minister for Education and Science. Careful consideration is being given to this matter at present and a decision will be communicated to the trustees at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timeframe for the provision of an amalgamated school is dependent, in the first instance, on the carrying out of a technical assessment of the two schools in question to establish their suitability for a single school development in the future. In this regard, the building unit of my Department will shortly be making the necessary arrangements to have this assessment carried out. Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to say when the school is likely to be opened. In the meantime the provision of temporary prefabricated accommodation at both <Col N="1631" /> schools has been approved and the school authorities advised of same.</P>

The Drumcondra English profiles are an additional such resource and it is hoped that teachers will incorporate them into their existing assessment practice as they find useful. Judgment on their usefulness is a matter best left to individual teachers and schools and that is why their use has not been made mandatory.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of requests by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding. As the Deputy will be aware, the funding arrangements for our schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial assistance in secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>I have already made clear in the House that I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level and I am committed to bringing <Col N="1635" /> greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools. I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. I increased the grant to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000. My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>
