      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased and honoured to accept Archbishop Connell's invitation and to head an official delegation attending the consistory in Rome on his appointment as cardinal. The delegation included my colleague, the Minister of State to the Government and at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, <Col N="2" /> the Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, the Ambassador to the Holy See, Mr. Eamon O'Tuathail, and my Aide de Camp, Captain Gerard O'Grady.</P>
    <P>On the morning of 21 February I attended the consistory in St. Peter's Square for the creation of the 44 new cardinals followed by lunch hosted by the rector, Monsignor John Fleming, in honour of Cardinal Connell at the Pontifical Irish College. That afternoon I made courtesy calls on the newly elevated Cardinal Murphy O'Connor of London, Cardinal Egan of New York and Cardinal McCarrick of Newark.</P>
    <P>The same evening I hosted a reception at Villa Spada, Embassy of Ireland to the Holy See in honour of Cardinal Connell. Guests included Cardinal Connell's family, Cardinal Daly and Archbishop Brady. I take this opportunity to put on record my deep appreciation to the Vatican for the courtesies extended to me and the other members of the delegation while there. It is a singular honour for Ireland and in particular, Dublin, to have our own cardinal after more than 115 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are excellent in terms of all the churches. I have regular meetings with them, as I am sure do other politicians, and have very good relations with them. In recent years I have had contact with Cardinal Daly, who takes a keen interest in Northern matters, and Archbishop Brady who is always extremely helpful. They are very courteous. I also have contacts, though not a great many, on other matters, and the same goes for the other churches which regularly call, particularly when there are new appointments. It can honestly be said that relations are good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I addressed the National Assembly in Wales on 1 March, the day dedicated to the patron saint of Wales, St. David, and was very warmly received. My address focused on the historic and cultural links between Ireland and Wales and the opportunities now emerging to significantly enhance our friendship and relationship in the context of devolution and the institutional arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> During my visit, I also met the First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales, Mr. Rhodri Morgan, and the Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Paul Murphy, and gave a keynote speech at a forum on &ldquo;Wales, Europe and the World&rdquo;, sponsored by the First Minister. Copies of both my speeches have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was forced to cut short my visit to Wales, cancelling a number of social engagements due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Nevertheless, the visit was successful and it was greatly appreciated by our Welsh hosts that I fulfilled the main planned engagements. In the light of the discussions during my visit, I look forward to a significant strengthening of relations between Ireland and Wales.</P>
    <P>Intensive contacts between the pro-Agreement parties and both Governments have continued over recent weeks in an effort to overcome the current difficulties. On 22 February I met the UUP, the SDLP and Sinn Féin in Government Buildings for a series of meetings. On Wednesday last I met the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Downing Street.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, also met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, and last week had a series of meetings in Washington, including with US Vice-President, Mr. Dick Cheney, Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell, and National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, to review progress.</P>
    <P>We hope we can find a way of overcoming the current difficulties and we will continue to do everything we can over the coming period to achieve a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms the weekend bombing in London. Those responsible have absolutely no regard for the expressed will of the people of Ireland, North and South, and have nothing to offer except misery and grief. Such attacks are totally counter-productive and only serve to increase our determination to secure a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>The programme for my visit to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day period has not yet been fully finalised. However, on current plans I will arrive in Washington on 15 March. While in Washington, I will attend a lunch hosted by Speaker Hastert on Capitol Hill, which I understand will be attended by President Bush. I will also attend an America-Ireland Fund dinner and meet the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Committee. It is hoped the Shamrock Ceremony will take place in the White House and that will entail a private meeting with the President.</P>
    <P>I look forward to meeting President Bush and members of his Administration in the course of my visit and to my discussions with them and other senior political figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give information on the possibility of the British Prime <Col N="6" /> Minister being in Northern Ireland later this week, and the event clashing with a proposed trip planned by the Taoiseach to Japan? Will the Taoiseach reflect on this and tell us the arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is still fluid to say the least. We have said to the parties in the North, and it has been agreed between the two Governments for some considerable time, that the current discussions cannot go on indefinitely and there is pressure on all sides to reach an agreement. We all recognise that the long-term future and stability of the Agreement may be at stake. The pro-Agreement parties want to overcome the difficulties which pose a threat to it and that is what we have been trying to do for the last seven weeks. Policing is an important part of the discussions but it is not the only issue. It is also vital that we address decommissioning and demilitarisation as well as the stability of the institutions. We cannot be deflected from that in the discussions and we hope to be in touch with the other parties in coming days.</P>
      <P>There are meetings today among those other parties to enable them to reach primary positions. My four negotiating officials have been in the United Kingdom since yesterday and had discussions in Downing Street into the early hours of this morning and again today. They will proceed from there around now to Belfast for more discussions with the parties, some of which are meeting themselves tonight, so it will be tomorrow before we can make any call about this. Needless to say, the other parties would like to make that call and if that involves round table talks I will have to be there but we will have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government have a policy on the current RUC recruitment campaign? Is it the Government's view that it is inappropriate to proceed with this recruitment campaign in advance of agreement on policing in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would like to have had all these issues tied down in advance. That would have been preferable but that said, I understand the difficulties of the RUC Chief Constable who must try to implement most of the Patten reforms within his organisation. It is sometimes forgotten that most of the Patten reforms are good policing matters and that there are no differences about them. The vast majority of them are agreed and the Chief Constable saw fit to go ahead with this. It was not with our agreement, which he did not need, but it was not the way we would have done things. That said, we have not made a big issue of it either. The crucial period will come in the autumn when recruitment and a new training programme take place. There will be considerable difficulties at that stage if the policing issue is not resolved. Dilemmas may be caused for many people then and I have made <Col N="7" /> that clear to all sides. I say this based on the discussions I have had with everyone and on their considered views on the matter. I understand why they have gone ahead with recruitment and why application forms have been sent out to all sides of the community, but reaching the bottom line will be another issue. What is done is done but the crucial period will come in the autumn as policing will have to be tied down at that stage. Otherwise the situation will be very difficult for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> One effect of the Taoiseach taking a wide range of questions is that it is hard to get coherence at Question Time. I wish to raise a different matter.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach visits the United States will he break with the usual obsequious position adopted by Irish Governments towards Washington and raise with President Bush his condemnation of the continued bombing of Iraq by Britain and the United States? Will he raise the question of the economic sanctions against Iraq and point out to President Bush that it is not the Saddam Hussein dictatorship which is suffering as a result of these sanctions but the millions of innocent men, women and children of the Iraqi population who are suffering appallingly in terms of a breakdown of the health care system and infrastructure because no materials, spare parts or medicines can be brought into the country? Will he ask President Bush to stop the sanctions regime and to reverse a situation which has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi people, particularly children? Finally, will the Taoiseach call on President Bush, in the course of his visit, to end the collective punishment against an innocent population caused by a dispute between regimes and governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Government representatives at these occasions have never been slow to raise issues of contention in a civilised and calm way. I have done so myself over a number of years, as have my predecessors. We discussed the issue of sanctions with former President Clinton on a number of occasions in the last few years. The issue will be brought forward again. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, raised it last week with all the people he met, including Vice-President Cheney and Ms Rice, and made the Irish view clear. We are also taking a forward position in the Security Council on the sanctions issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two issues arise from the Deputy's remarks. On the one hand, Saddam Hussein maintains deaf ears to what the rest of the world says about weapons of mass destruction, weapons that affect his own people as well as others. On the other hand, it is true that ordinary citizens, as always, bear the brunt of war and make all the sacrifices, rather than Saddam Hussein. Both issues are important and we will take the opportunity to raise them again. With regard to the bombing, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, last week raised the <Col N="8" /> rationale for these events. As always in these meetings, the American side is put and we have a chance to give our views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach since he replied to 16 questions together. With regard to his visit to Wales, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the numerical composition of the assembly representation in the British and Irish Inter-Parliamentary Group, as it is now known, is satisfactory, having regard to the numbers that come from Westminster, Leinster House and the other assemblies? Does the numerical composition reflect what was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement? I read the Taoiseach's speech to the Welsh Assembly. Does he believe he gave good example by going to Wales last week when the Government was asking everybody not to visit there unless it was essential?</P>
      <P>I have two questions regarding Prime Minister Blair. Did the Taoiseach, when he met the Prime Minister on Wednesday last week, raise with him the concerns of this Administration about the apparent laxity with which British authorities are dealing with the foot and mouth outbreak, having regard to the widespread epidemic nature of its occurrence on the island of Britain? If so, what was his response? Second, the Taoiseach might recall that on Question Time last Wednesday, we spoke about the possibility of the British Government giving an indication that it would be willing to give a commitment to hold substantial inquiries into the murders of Pat Finucane, Mr. Hamill and Rosemary Nelson and that such a commitment might, in the context of making progress on these matters, lead to a resolution of the impasse on policing. Will the Taoiseach indicate if he raised that matter with the Prime Minister and, if so, what was the Prime Minister's response?</P>
      <P>Finally, will the Taoiseach confirm something I understood him to indicate to Deputy Noonan? Did he say that if progress was made later this week which would result in round table talks taking place he would attend them and defer his visit to Japan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The interparliamentary tier is an issue which must be kept under review. With the exception of the Ulster Unionist Party I am satisfied that things are up and running. One of the difficulties is the small number of members in the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales. There are 60 members in Wales who have difficulties and commitments but who wish to play a useful role. A number of members of the Welsh Assembly are Irish born or are of Irish parentage, most of whom wish to play an active role and did so at the meeting in Killarney last week. We have to keep this issue under review to ensure the system works well. However, so far so good and the Welsh and Scottish representatives were happy to be in Killarney.</P>

    <P>I was right to go to Wales. I restricted my movements in the five or six hours I spent there <Col N="9" /> and did not come across too much grass or visit any farms. Not to go would have been an insult to the Welsh. St. David's Day is important to them and this was the first occasion on which a foreign leader addressed the Assembly. That was important for them and they had organised an important conference on business and the future of Wales in Europe. I did not attend social events but the other two events were important. A decision not to attend might have been misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The only issue in which the Welsh media was interested was why Wales could not play its rugby match. All but two of the questions I was asked concerned the reason we could not play the match. It was clear where the Welsh media's priority lay. Its concern was not just about the Irish crowds but about playing the rugby match.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of Cheltenham. I do not understand why the festival is still going ahead. I have raised these issues with the Prime Minister on a number of occasions in the past two weeks. I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will have the opportunity of talking to the British Minister for Agriculture later today. I have raised Cheltenham and other issues with Prime Minister Blair so we can understand the situation.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister recently told me that all reported cases in the UK are linked to the original farm. There have been reports about this issue and I thought from some of the reports in the English media that there were other cases not directly related to that farm. I heard such reports yesterday. However, the Prime Minister stated that is not so and that all cases, up to this morning's case, are directly related to the same large farm.</P>
    <P>I have stated our views to the Prime Minister and given him the update I received from the interdepartmental group today. I have also asked that the British Minister for Agriculture speak to our Minister, Deputy Walsh. They know our views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday we discussed the SDLP's views on progress in the Nelson, Hamill and Finucane inquiries and its opinion that such progress would assist the overall position. The answers and the progress we have got on that are still not satisfactory. We have still not received commitments. Sometimes there is a misunderstanding in that people think all cases are the same. These are landmark cases and events which have happened over the years and they are not all the same. They are different cases which are deeply ingrained in Northern Nationalists and republicans. They will not go away and we must continue to address them. They are similar in that they feed directly into the policing issue, but they are not similar in other aspects. We will continue to state our position on those cases.</P>
    <P>As regards what Deputies Noonan and Quinn said, I do not think, and I have not thought for some time, that it is possible to get a conclusive and comprehensive final position on all the items <Col N="10" /> which are not agreed, namely, demilitarisation, decommissioning and policing. If everyone puts in the required effort, including the Irish Government, we could get a process that would allow us to manage those issues over a difficult summer. I do not understand why people would want to leave issues in a vacuum and not at least have a process which moves them safely into a future period. That is why I am anxious to try to come to at least that conclusion over the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the sentiments he has expressed are different from the sentiments he expressed previously in this House because the emphasis is now on a process rather than a conclusive final settlement? Perhaps he would elaborate on that. Has he analysed a speech given in south Armagh by a leading member of the IRA, Brian Keenan, which was initially reported in a Boston newspaper and then picked up by newspapers here? Is he aware of similar sentiments expressed by leading republicans which have not been reported, as far as I am aware, in the national press? If he has analysed those sentiments as expressed, is he still as confident as previously that it is the IRA's intention to put its weaponry beyond use and the intention of Sinn Féin in any circumstances to call on young Nationalists and republicans to join the new police service? </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>What I am saying now is not different from what I said last week, namely, that I did not see us being able to tie down all these areas prior to an election because we are speeding into that. There are clear understandings in all the discussions we have had over the past seven weeks or so. Everyone must agree to those issues and sign up to them in an interrelated way. It would be nicer, easier and, from a negotiating point of view, safer to conclude totally on the policing issue and move on. However, that is not a likely possibility this side of an election unless things change dramatically in the next 48 or 72 hours and I do not see that happening. I do not want to mislead the House on that issue.</P>
      <P>I saw the comments attributed to senior republican figures in recent days. Whatever about the comments of individuals from time to time, the leadership of Sinn Féin has brought the republican movement to participate in democratic politics by signing up to the Good Friday Agreement and in all the discussions we have had since then. It is still doing so in all the discussions we are having to implement fully all aspects of the Agreement. I have noted the strong condemnation made on Sunday and yesterday by a number of Sinn Féin leaders, including Mr. Kelly, Mr. McGuinness and others, of the bombing of the BBC in London.</P>

      <P>I hope we can still get to a position where all republican and Nationalist parties will sign up to the new policing authority of Northern Ireland. For that to happen a number of aspects will have to be dealt with and it will take some more time to do that. We have just been talking about the Finucane, Hamill and Nelson inquiries but there are other issues, including emblems and badges. Those issues have to be resolved before we will get agreement on them, either from the SDLP or Sinn Féin, and we are continuing to endeavour to do that. There are difficulties in these negotiations for other people in other parties, which I understand. We are seeking to reach a fair understanding of the implementation of the Patten report as completely as possible, while at the same time understanding other people's difficulties. We will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>As I have said so many times on Question Time, to bring normality to the affairs of Northern Ireland and to overcome all the difficulties of recent decades, not to mind history, the community requires an acceptable police force &ndash; acting as normal police services the world over &ndash; able to deal with all issues, including violence, smuggling and drugs offences. To do that, everybody needs to be involved. That is why we must continue working to ensure participation in the new police service by all sides of the community, including people who perhaps would not be associated with any side.</P>

      <P>On 28 February, Deputy Quinn raised a question in this Chamber along the same lines that the Taoiseach has just addressed, as to whether Sinn Féin wanted to find an acceptable form of policing in the North of Ireland. Will the Taoiseach &ndash; and Deputy Quinn, also, when he has the opportunity &ndash; acknowledge that this is an issue which Sinn Féin takes with the utmost seriousness? The communities that support our party have borne the brunt of sectarian policing by the RUC over the past 80 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. They need and demand a representative and accountable police service. I have already asked a question of the Taoiseach and I have a second question. Am I right in understanding from the Taoiseach's earlier remarks, that he agrees that this issue must be got absolutely right &ndash; the Taoiseach will be familiar with that language &ndash; and that the actions of the RUC Chief Constable in proceeding with <Col N="12" /> the recruiting advertisements when this matter remains unresolved is unacceptable? In addition, the policing boards that were required under the same British legislation have not yet been established. Even in terms of the British Government's own policing legislation the decision to proceed was absolutely unacceptable. I would like to know the Taoiseach's position on both those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential to get it absolutely right but, as Deputy Ó Caoláin would agree, the phrase &ldquo;absolutely right&rdquo; must include everybody. However, it is not easy to get it absolutely right for everybody. For example, in getting it absolutely right for somebody, one might get it totally wrong for someone else. As the Deputy knows, that is part of the dilemma. I am endeavouring to get it absolutely right, in a way which is fair to everybody, so that all can move forward.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policing boards, it is essential that the balance, the system and the operational aspects are correct. I believe that can be achieved. Mr. Chris Patten did his homework well and if we could achieve what he set out in his report, that would be very acceptable to us. I see no reason to go beyond what he proposed.</P>
      <P>On the administration of policing, the aspects of that can also be got right. Admittedly there are some difficulties. At one stage, we had 11 points which we tried to resolve. We do not have anything like that outstanding at present. I think we can get a satisfactory outcome. Deputy Quinn referred last week to the issue of emblems and badges. We understand the historical difficulties in that regard and we are all at one in trying to find a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the policing issue, could the Taoiseach indicate what progress is being made on the various cross-Border initiatives between An Gárda Síochána in this jurisdiction and the new police service in the North, in relation to training and placement positions for members of An Gárda Síochána north of the border and <i>vice versa</i>? Given the level of vacancies in the police service in the North, are there opportunities for filling those vacancies in the context of more cross-Border co-operation? Would it be an important step towards helping to make the police service in the North more acceptable to both communities, if that level of co-operation was visible and acknowledged more openly? </P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach also agree that there is a role for a greater level of bilingualism in the new service, including written material and forms, and by acknowledging that the Irish language and perhaps also the Scots Ulster language, as well as English, should be more visible to indicate an acceptance by the police service of the diversity within the community? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's visit to Wales, has he subsequently communicated any concern to the British Prime Minister that the Cheltenham horseracing event still seems set to take <Col N="13" /> place? Would he also accept that it is particularly vital for him to re-establish his own bona fides in that regard, given the widespread view among the public that his visit was not as necessary as he perceived it to be?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of the Irish language and Ulster Scots, a number of efforts are being made to promote and co-ordinate the use of both languages. We have been supporting that in every way possible. The process of administrative change may not yet have reached the stage of using bi-lingual forms but I hope matters can move in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also inquired about the level of co-operation between the Garda and the RUC. In respect of security matters, as has been the case in recent years, the Garda and the RUC continue to co-ordinate their activities as much as possible. I hope that the system, perhaps within the NIO and other bodies, will improve. It has been publicly stated that two members of the Garda Síochána responded to an advertisement for a number of positions and, on a technicality, were not called for interview. I do not believe that was very smart and perhaps I will leave my comments at that and not state what I really believe.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that levels of co-operation must be developed and that the process should include members of the general police forces and not just senior officers. If this happens, signals will be sent to members of the Garda Síochána about the role they can play. There are no difficulties between high ranking officers, the Governments or the various Departments. However, down the ranks there continue to be problems which may be linked to historical matters. When members of the RUC served in Bosnia and elsewhere, they received training at Templemore. That is an acceptable example of co-operation and it should continue.</P>
      <P>I already answered questions from Deputy Quinn in respect of Cheltenham. With regard to the matter involving Wales, I do not believe there was any misunderstanding. That issue was not raised in any of the hundreds of telephone calls we received at the weekend. We must make it clear that anyone travelling from rural areas, farms and other locations should not be doing so. Their actions are clearly unhelpful. I am conscious that 60,000 people per day are passing through the airports but, where possible, people should avoid travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard one comment which made the comparison between addressing the Welsh Assembly and attending a football match. I do not believe any Member would take that seriously and I certainly <Col N="14" /> do not. I take a light-hearted view of this matter in any event, given that the FA Carling Premiership is effectively over. There is no need for people to travel to football matches. However, we must continue to be vigilant for a considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated earlier that he did not expect the round of talks taking place today, which will continue tomorrow and, perhaps, into the weekend, to achieve a settlement in respect of decommissioning, demilitarisation or policing. He further stated that what was rather involved was the putting in place of a process. By the term &ldquo;process&rdquo; does the Taoiseach mean a timetable for dealing with matters under de Chastelain, a separate timetable for dealing with matters involving policing and a third for dealing with matters involving demilitarisation? Would this process include all-party discussions which could culminate, in the autumn, with a round table conference and, ultimately, lead to an agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussions that have taken place during the past seven or eight weeks, we have negotiated what will be the final position in respect of those issues and a number of others. In order for decommissioning &ndash; which will involve de Chastelain &ndash; and demilitarisation to take place, a great deal must happen, including the removal of a large amount of military infrastructure. The position with regard to policing is similar. The process involves 11 points, some of which were discussed in this House. It appears to the two Governments that it will not be possible to have the parties involved sign up to these before the advent of national and local elections. Whatever progress can be made now should be made and we should not allow for loose ends in terms of the way we bring it forward on the other side. If possible, we should do this by setting dates because the necessary work that has been done and the outstanding issues will not change after eight weeks of intensive discussions. On the basis that this weekend, the run-up to St. Patrick's week, was always going to be the final break, we can set down a clear position in terms of what has been achieved, what has to happen during the interim period and what remains to be completed on the other side. If that does not happen some parties, without being specific, will be in an amazingly difficult and uncertain position, which is unfair. We all know enough about election periods and marching seasons and that would inevitably lead to a difficult summer, and it would be wrong to leave it in that position. I say here again, and no doubt I will repeat it today in telephone calls, that if parties cannot sign up to everything &ndash; I do not particularly like that but I understand it &ndash; they should at least bring all the aspects to their final position this week.</P>

      <P>I want to ask three questions. First, in respect of the British-Irish interparliamentary tier which is part and parcel of the Good Friday Agreement, does the Taoiseach believe the numerical composition of representatives from this House and from Westminster is in excess of a parity of esteem, to borrow a phrase from another place, in relation to all of the other nations affected? Perhaps the Taoiseach might reconsider that composition at some future date. Second, with regard to foot and mouth disease and setting good example, since next week is a committee week of the House, and by coincidence the same week as Cheltenham &ndash; the Chief Whip is to be complimented &ndash; will the Taoiseach ensure that representatives of this House do not set a bad example by going to Cheltenham? Will he join me, the leader of the Fine Gael Party and others in ensuring no member of the parliamentary party goes to Cheltenham next week, irrespective of whether it is on or off?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the interparliamentary tier, I detect from Deputy Quinn that he has heard there is some difficulty in that respect. I will be glad to explore that. I have no problem keeping it under review. All I have heard is that some of the smaller assemblies, Wales and Scotland in particular, have numerical problems but I am pre<Col N="16" /> pared to look at any aspect of that. I do not have a difficulty with it.</P>
      <P>On the foot and mouth question, I cannot understand why anyone would still want to run a horse in Cheltenham because it is almost on top of an exclusion zone.</P>
      <P>This is not just another race meeting, which would be bad enough, but is on top of an exclusion zone. I was told last week in Wales by the British Minister of Agriculture that he believed Cheltenham would not go ahead. No one from here, or anywhere else, should go.

      <P>At the inaugural meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format, in Belfast on 27 October 2000, the council agreed to establish the new all island tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited. The company was formally incorporated on 11 December 2000 and its board of directors was appointed on 19 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The functions of the new company are set out in detail in its memorandum of association. The new company will have responsibility for tourism brand Ireland, strategic all-island destination marketing in all markets outside Ireland, international roll out of regional and product marketing programmes formulated by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and operation of the overseas office network.</P>
      <P>I am greatly impressed by the enthusiasm, energy and professionalism of the new board under the chairmanship of Andrew Coppel with Ann Riordan as vice-chair.

        <b>:</b> Is the Minister aware that there is much concern about this new tourism body? The all-Ireland approach means that we are unable to emphasise our significant currency difference with sterling. Particularly US and UK tourists have a big advantage in coming here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro versus the dollar and pound sterling. This body cannot promote this as it would appear to be discriminating against one part of the island. Another currency advantage, for visitors from Germany and France, next in importance to the United States and Britain, cannot be emphasised either. Is the Minister aware that a Kerry independent Fianna Fáil councillor, Michael Donoghue, said that the all-Ireland approach of the new body disadvantages areas further south such as Kerry, which will lose out significantly?</P>

      <P>Kerry and southern parts of the country suffer too much congestion. Decongestion will benefit them and allow the regional policy to bring tourists to other areas where the product is equally valid. Regionalisation must be pursued.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion of commissioning an expert group from outside the jurisdiction to assess and report on the future need for sports stadia. I consider that the needs of sport in this country have been clearly identified. This Government, which has invested more in the development of sport at all levels than any previous Government and continues to do so, will proceed with the stadium and other facilities planned for Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. Would he not agree that, despite what he said, there is Croke Park, an 80,000 seater stadium in Dublin with a £40 million overrun, Lansdowne Road and the Eircom park project, from which the Government is trying to buy the FAI off? The costs of these projects are running out of control. Fresh outside eyes without the baggage of sporting links here could look at what the country needs and how the taxpayers' money could best be spent in providing stadia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would add to the costs the Deputy is quite rightly trying to keep down. What is the point of adding another layer of bureaucracy by commissioning more outside consultants to inform us of what we already know from PricewaterhouseCoopers? The outlying parts of the project will soon begin, and many excellent people are interested in tendering for these. Only when documents of tender are received does one know how much a project will cost. We will know shortly if the professionally estimated cost of £350 million for Sports Campus Ireland is correct. There are six or seven companies, from all over the world, who are very interested in putting tender documents to us soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to follow the Minister's logic. He quoted extensively from a report which looked at 15 stadia built by city or state in the United States. The average over-run in the cost of stadia was 73.4%. Building inflation is between 20% and 30%, so it is ludicrous that the Minister sticks with the figure of £280 million for the stadium, a year after it was first announced. It does not stand up to economic scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>During a meeting last October the chairs and managers of the regional tourism authorities presented me with a paper in which they listed the public sector bodies involved in the tourism sector, outlined their roles and responsibilities and suggested a number of ways of improving co-operation between agencies in order to ensure optimum return from investment of public funds in tourism marketing and product development.</P>
      <P>The multiplicity of bodies involved with tourism development and promotion carries the risk of duplication of effort and less efficient use of resources, particularly public resources. The best way of avoiding fragmentation is if all bodies involved with tourism development work towards the realisation of a common strategy, adopting a unified and clearly focused approach.</P>
      <P>The tourism development strategy, which Bord Fáilte has recently published, is designed to provide a framework within which coherent decisions can be made by all funding bodies whose activities impact on tourism. In addition to a national strategic framework, the strategy identifies the importance of drawing up integrated plans for tourism zones to which all players can work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under new contractual arrangements entered into between Bord Fáilte and regional tourism authorities, the RTAs are to embark on a pro-active programme to co-ordinate all publicly funded tourism activities in their regions. This will ensure as far as possible that they contribute optimally to the achievement of national tourism objectives, and that local promotional materials accord with national and regional tourism strategies. In respect of rural tourism, following initial consumer-oriented research to define the <Col N="20" /> concept properly, Bord Fáilte will establish a focus group, representative of a wide range of relevant interests to come up with agreed action points to which all can work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In the Western Development Commission area, a high-level steering group is being established to co-ordinate all relevant interests in the implementation of a common tourism strategy. I have asked Bord Fáilte to chair that group and the RTAs will be represented on it. Perhaps most importantly on the issue of co-ordination, in the context of the national development plan, my Department has continued to place enormous emphasis on the need to ensure that infrastructure spend by other Departments and nontourism agencies, supports tourism priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we need to streamline our resources. When I came to this Department three years ago, it was pointed out to me that £110 million was outside my remit; I have no control over it. Since then, Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities have agreed new contractual arrangements and I am pleased with the way they have been handled. The new contracts mean the authorities have to submit new plans to Bord Fáilte so that unnecessary overlapping is eliminated. It was recently pointed out to me that the number of glossy brochures and other literature published by the various regions would fill 20 juggernauts, enough to stretch from O'Connell Street to the docks. I agree there is a need for co-ordination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last October, I asked the Sports Council to undertake a review of Ireland's participation in the Sydney Olympics. The purpose of the review, which was carried out by a steering group appointed by the council, was to learn from the experiences of Sydney 2000 and to develop a strategy, based on the analysis of the factual information gathered during the review, for the preparations towards Athens 2004.</P>
      <P>The final report is an invaluable and objective analysis of the Sydney experience, which will make an important contribution to our planning for future major events. I am grateful to both the steering group for the dedication and hard work it put in to ensure that the report was delivered to me within such a short space of time and to every organisation and to every individual who co-operated with the steering group. I fully accept the 29 recommendations of the report, the implementation of which can make a real difference to the athletes preparing for Athens 2004 and beyond. I have asked that everyone directly involved take on board these recommendations and work together, in a spirit of generosity and openness, to nurture, support and encourage our emerging and elite talent. No less is expected by Irish people, who treasure and value sport and who have come to expect that our athletes and teams perform to the very best of their abilities, at the highest level of Olympic and world sport.</P>
      <P>It was the opinion of the steering group, and I fully endorse this, that the Irish Sports Council, as the body charged with the responsibility for the development of sport, is best placed to oversee the delivery of the strategies and outcomes of this report and to carry out discussions with the relevant national governing bodies and other interested parties. In this context, I understand the Sports Council has already made preparations for undertaking this process.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>It is my intention that we should benefit from the experience and that the lessons of Sydney 2000 are used to enhance our preparations for all future major events. In the meantime, I urge everybody to focus on the positive aspects of this review and the implementation of recommendations that will have a lasting and beneficial effect on Irish sport.</P>

      <P>The review group also suggested that a review should be carried out on the functions of the NCTC by the Sports Council. When is this due to take place? What are the exact terms of the review, and who will carry it out?</P>

      <P>The review recommended changes within the NCTC. I will await its recommendations which will be carried out by the Sports Council. The two will work in conjunction with one another and it will be the overall responsibility of the Minister to see that recommendations are carried out.</P>
      <P>With regard to coaching, the report was barely with me when I met all the national organisations involved in Olympic sport. They indicated that funding was the main priority. In the budget we responded by doubling the funding of the Sports Council over the period. That funding was distributed to the national organisations and it is up to them to indicate their priorities. If we are to go by what they told me, funding was very much bound up with coaching and the lack of coaches and where athletes could be sent. It will be a matter for them where they direct the increased funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Olympic sports operate on a four year cycle and their grant aid should reflect this. Is there a plan in place that would enable sports organisations to know what funding they will have over the four year period, given that a similar scheme has just been announced to fund the Arts Council under a four year plan? </P>
      <P>The review group also recommended that the OCI be given partnership funding to assist in developing a more professional approach in its operations. What steps has the Minister taken to implement this proposal?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that Government, OCI and NCTC policy should be athlete-centred and should not involve the type of turf war that has been going on for the past four years? It is the athletes who are important here and all the organisations and associations should support measures to help them rather than fighting a turf war that has done little good for Irish sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine that matter. When I became Minister there was an <i>ad hoc</i> system in operation under which each national organisation applied for and was given funding according to what it had planned. I introduced a strategy whereby every supporting organisation had to submit a strategy plan by January so we would know the requirements of each organisation. That meant if a world championship were scheduled for a particular year it would be catered for, rather than being considered as an afterthought. <Col N="23" /> This system, whereby an organisation submits a strategy plan in early January when it knows in advance about championships could lead to an overall four year plan. Perhaps there is some fine-tuning that could be done, but there is a strategy in place for each organisation which operates on a year to year basis and the organisations tend to know in advance their exact calls for the coming year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the OCI, I will keep my part of the bargain. It has requested a meeting with me which I have arranged for Thursday.</P>

      <P>The revitalising areas by planning, investment and development programme, otherwise known as the RAPID programme, targets the 25 most deprived neighbourhoods in the State for special investment involving the front-loading of State investment for facilities and services to bring about a major improvement in the living standards of the residents of these areas over the next three years. As the 25 areas identified by the objective designation process are all located in the major urban centres, the Government has decided that there will be a second strand to this programme which will be introduced over the next few months for rural areas and provincial towns.</P>

      <P>At the meeting held on 23 February between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, representatives of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited representatives of the Football Association of Ireland and I, the Taoiseach outlined a Government proposal for detailed negotiations with the FAI on participating in Stadium Ireland and Sports Campus Ireland. The FAI representatives asked a series of specific questions on the proposal and related issues. The Taoiseach, other Ministers present and I responded to these queries and the Taoiseach undertook to have an expanded detailed proposal prepared for discussion at a further meeting between the two sides. This further meeting was held yesterday at which the Taoiseach expanded on the proposal which would form the basis for further detailed negotiation. The FAI agreed to respond to the Government urgently based on it communicating this proposal to its constituent organisations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm a report in one of today's newspapers that the Government offer is to advance £45 million to the FAI in lieu of the pre-sale of corporate boxes and ten year tickets; if and when the stadium opens in 2005 half of this money, £22.5 million, would have to be paid back to the Government and, in the event of the stadium not going ahead, that the £45 million will remain unclaimed with the FAI?</P>

      <P>I wish to give the House as much information as I possibly can regarding these meetings. Our meeting yesterday basically concluded with the FAI agreeing to the request to respond urgently to the proposals after discussing them with its constituent organisations. If it has <Col N="27" /> given a message to newspapers in whatever form they appear, that is a matter for the FAI.</P>
      <P>As regards the Government side of the bargain, it was agreed that the FAI would discuss the proposals we put to it yesterday on, I understand, Friday with its constituent organisations and come back to us with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer or further proposals, depending on what are the views of its organisations. The proposals put forward at yesterday's meeting are confidential to us and the FAI. I cannot confirm or deny reports in the newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Deputy attempted to bring forward a proposal way back when times were hard. However, few men and women have the foresight to bring forward a proposal, as we have brought forward for Campus and Stadium Ireland. This pertains to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and others. I gave Bernard O'Byrne credit for his vision for Eircom Park and for bringing forward the proposal.</P>
      <P>I have always told the FAI that we would prefer it as a partner, not as a tenant, in Campus and Stadium Ireland, together with the IRFU, CSID and the Government. This is entirely a matter for the FAI. The proposals put forward to it make financial sense, and I have never had any other opinion. If the FAI decides to go ahead with Eircom Park that is entirely a matter for it.</P>

He has not denied that the statements in today's newspaper report are what are on offer. Will he give us the information, bearing in mind that it is in the public arena? He should officially give the information to Deputies.</P>
      <P>Is there any question of compensating the FAI for the money already spent on the development of the Eircom Park proposal and the money lost by the FAI in meeting the objection placed by the Government to the planning permission for Eircom Park?</P>

      <P>I do not like withholding any information from the House but I am in a catch 22 because one makes a deal with those with whom one is negotiating. They agree to bring it back to their organisation and on the basis of that data they will make a decision on whether to join in Sports Campus Ireland. Given that it is a catch <Col N="28" /> 22, I cannot elaborate on it further. Whatever the Deputy reads in the newspapers is entire speculation so far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>All issues were discussed with the FAI including the compensation issue but nothing definite has been agreed. I am of the view, and I was supported by others, that if compensation were to be provided on an issue such as this it would set a bad precedent. It is a matter for discussion but compensation along those lines would set a bad precedent. We have had no discussions with the IRFU and the GAA but rest assured I can hear the 'phone ringing and in the interests of sport we will be prepared to enter into negotiations with those other organisations also.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister choose to have discussions with the FAI? Has he any intention of having discussions with all the other sporting organisations in the country that do such good work for young people, athletes and other disciplines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I chose the FAI is that I have always indicated it would be preferable to have a campus that included all sports. I have always made that clear. Ireland is unique in that it has three major sports which cater for large attendances. Most European countries have only soccer while other countries have soccer and rugby. Ireland is the only country in Europe that has three disciplines of sport which attract large attendances. I will debate the argument with anybody about Croke Park being a national stadium. It is not on for many reasons, one of which is that there are 40,000 people in and around Croke Park. I admire what they have done for Gaelic and hurling and that they have allowed Croke Park to develop. They have made sacrifices in consultation with the Taoiseach, community groups and the GAA and Croke Park has been allowed to flourish to the flagship stadium it is today. We do not have a stadium for soccer or <Col N="29" /> rugby capable of holding the attendances those two sports will require in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>To date there has been no necessity to involve the Olympic Council of Ireland on the site. That would only occur in the event of Ireland applying for the Olympic Games. I was trying to give an idea of the scale of the project being undertaken and the scale of the facilities involved. For example, if the Olympic Games were to be held here &ndash; I am not saying we can have them &ndash; the infrastructure would be needed. Athletics account for 50% of Olympic sports. To do that, the stadium would have to be closed for approximately three months to put in the Olympic track.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide direct grant aid for tourism product development. Bord Fáilte was the implementing body for such schemes under the Tourism Operational Programme, 1994-1999, with decisions on grant approval being made by an independent product management board. A similar arrangement will be in place under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 under which I was able to obtain a commitment of £100 million for a tourism product development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The new tourism product investment scheme will be administered <i>via</i> the tourism measures of the regional operational programmes. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>There is a general consensus that the focus of public investment in tourism projects must be to enhance the potential of less developed tourism areas by supporting the development of significant attractions or clusters of attractions in such areas. Once a good attractions base starts to be built, it is my view that accommodation developments &ndash; whether refurbishment or new build &ndash; will follow. In and around areas where new attractions are to be developed under the regional operational programmes, accommodation projects are likely to become even more bankable propositions.</P>
    <P>There is quite a long response and in view of the time element and the Deputy's concern about this matter if he wishes I can&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Minister accept that the family owned hotel is an unique and traditional feature of the Irish tourism sector. Those hotels are small, intimate and have a personality all their own, an old world charm, but many will go to the wall. They are caught between the mega all purpose complexes and the B &amp; Bs. Something is needed to underpin that segment of the market which has a potential and a future all its own. Many of these will go to the wall in the next five or six years unless a refurbishment/modernisation programme is put in place to enable them survive and compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I did not continue to read the reply was to allow the Deputy in. I share the Deputy's concerns for the small family run business hotels which we have to try to help. However, I am running up against a number of difficulties. For example, the IHF recommendations last week called for the abolition of grants schemes for accommodation. The different sectors are at variance with one another. I would be happy to try to provide a scheme with a view to helping this sector but the question is whether State aids would be approved. That is the problem with providing this sector with grant aid which both the Deputy and I agree is required. It will probably be another six weeks before we receive a response on the operational programme for tourism. We will not know until then. I am anxious and I share the Deputy's concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree a compensation package will be required? There have been a substantial number of cancellations in the national interest because of the foot and mouth disease crisis. If that continues the tourism industry will be in crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="31" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are concentrating on the agriculture sector and all that entails, we sometimes forget that 184,000 people are employed in the tourism sector which has taken its share of the brunt of the foot and mouth disease crisis. The industry is worth £3 billion to the economy. Jobs will be lost soon but we must ensure that we prioritise. It is vitally important that the agriculture sector remains disease-free and safe because of its value to the economy. I am glad the Deputy raised the issue because the tourism sector is suffering and will suffer even more in the weeks ahead with the cancellation of matches and so on. I admire the sporting organisations for the stand they have taken. The Ireland-England rugby international is estimated to have cost Dublin between £20 million and £25 million.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage any programme of compensation. The Taoiseach and the leaders of the Opposition have described the foot and mouth disease outbreak as a national crisis. We all must play our part and wear the green jersey. I hope the crisis is alleviated as quickly as possible. I hope the situation will be looked on in a positive light in the coming weeks, particularly given what will happen over the next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that there is a visitors threshold of 70,000 people under the next tourism operational programme for products to qualify for grant-aid? Will he also confirm that clusters of projects in certain areas will be allowed if they reach the 70,000 threshold? Is there a foundation to the reports that products will not be grant-aided unless they attract 70,000 visitors?</P>

When will the marketing and promotion take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter question I have informed ITIC that I am prepared to meet its representatives. I have also indicated to the organisation that it would be appropriate if its representatives met officials of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures have been mentioned about the number of visitors products should attract before they receive grant-aid, including 70,000 and 100,000. I will confirm to the Deputy whether a figure has <Col N="32" /> been agreed. However, it is again a case of waiting for the response from Brussels on the operational programme in six weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the current position with regard to foot and mouth disease. I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>I have kept the House and the public fully informed on the efforts to ensure food and mouth disease is kept out of the State. In this regard there have been press briefings, my Department's website has been updated on a regular basis each day and both Houses have been informed on a daily basis of relevant developments.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tracing of animals, I do not think it is necessary to go into detail. I have kept the House fully informed of important developments and the work on animal tracing is continuing. To date there has been no confirmed case of foot and mouth disease in the State nor is there any case where clinical signs are present.</P>
      <P>I wish now to turn to non-essential farm visits. These have been suspended. I do not, however, consider visits arising from a requirement to test animals for other important animal diseases, such as tuberculosis and brucellosis, to be non-essential. Furthermore, these visits are an additional form of surveillance for foot and mouth and other diseases and enable veterinary officials from my Department to examine animals for symptoms. These officials have been instructed to adhere strictly to the Department's guidelines on disinfectant procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> In relation to authorisation of movements off-farm, Deputies will be aware that with effect from 6 p.m. on Saturday, 3 March, I have banned the movement of susceptible animals, namely, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, within the State, save those proceeding directly to slaughter, and then under permit. The details of the permitting system introduced with effect from today have been widely broadcast, are available on the Department's website and will be advertised in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on Thursday. They are widely disseminated through the Teagasc website and its offices, and application forms are available in post offices, district veterinary offices and Teagasc offices throughout the country. RTE radio and television has been doing a superb job in communicating these developments to the general public.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that every effort is being made to ensure the disease does not cross our borders. Army and Garda resources have been mobilised and a great deal of assistance is being provided by a variety of other State and private organisations, and by the general public. Staff in the Department are vigorously investigating any situation giving rise to the remotest suspicion of clinical symptoms being present or contact with diseased animals or infected areas in any part of the UK. This work will continue for some time until we are absolutely satisfied the risk has passed.</P>
    <P>Regarding illegal imports, the House is aware that the Department and the Garda Síochána is currently investigating a number of alleged incidents. I assure the House that we are taking these incidents very seriously. In this regard I have already announced my intention to bring new legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas tomorrow, to be initiated in the Seanad, providing swingeing new powers to authorised officers in relation to these matters. I assure the House that these powers will be availed of to pursue those who, through their reckless self-interest, put the economic and social fabric of the country at risk through illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain there are lessons to be learned from the crisis. However, it is important to acknowledge that to date the contingency plan which my Department has in place, and which was approved by the European Commission, is working efficiently. This is not to suggest the risk has in any way subsided. However, it is clear that all the State agencies involved in this collective effort have, to date, done a tremendous job in terms of putting in place a comprehensive range of controls in an incredibly short timescale. I am certain we can continue to rely on the support of the public and the House for our continuing efforts to protect our borders from this terrible disease.</P>

Surely traceability is of vital importance at this stage, both to trace the origins of the animals concerned and, for future reference, to find out where they go subsequently and whether all animals imported in the period concerned have been destroyed in a way which will ensure against a potential outbreak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in providing any information. I have given information to the House for the past number of sitting days, and any additional information will be given to the House as fully as I am aware of it. The Department sought to trace imports from 1 February, before the outbreak in Essex. In monitoring, tracing and investigating the Department found that a number of consignments of sheep came to the country, which are fairly well document. I can go through these again in detail if the House so wishes &ndash; there were cases in Athleague, Dunleer, Carlow, Wexford and Mayo. Since the ban came into effect on 21 February, the morning after notification from the UK, we have no evidence whatsoever, right up to this morning when I spoke with the Garda, that any consignment of susceptible animals has come into the State. We are continuing to monitor the situation, including animals which may have had contact with other animals, that is animals which were at a mart in Northern Ireland, Scotland or the UK in general. We are of the view that we have traced all such animals in the period from 1 February, but certain investigations are being carried out by the Garda and the RUC and people are being interviewed. In a number of these cases the investigations are incomplete. Statements made by people give additional information and certain farms, flocks and herds are restricted as a precaution in different parts of the country, a process which is ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said some kinds of tests, such as those for TB and brucellosis, are still being carried out and that visits are taking place to farms for those purposes. Will the Minister say exactly what range of visiting activity is currently taking place? Is he satisfied that it constitutes a better use of resources than any other possible uses, such as tracing animals, enforcing restrictions, etc.? Were officials or servants of his Department present in Athleague when the relevant consignment of sheep arrived there and, if so, what investigation has been carried out into their activities? Will he tell the House whether officials, officers or servants of his Department were present at the meat plant in Kildare when a consignment of sheep was brought there and subsequently sent out again to farms in the Carlow-south Kilkenny area? Will the new movement permits which are about to be issued be retained at the destination specified in the permit? When will the proposed legislation be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The Minister seemed to overlook one of Deputy Penrose's queries, which related to whether there are any discussions with the UK authorities about what seems to us to be their lax approach to preventing the further spread of the disease in the UK and its consequent dangers for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>On consequential visits by veterinary officers and Department officers for testing, testing has been discontinued. The only tests being carried out are where disease already exists, where a farm is locked up and where the farmer wants a consequential test done. This is minimal and does not take up any time. The veterinary advice to me is that it is constructive and a very good thing if there is disease on the farm and the test is carried out in controlled conditions by the veterinary surgeon.</P>
      <P>There are ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections carried out by Department officers and that was the case in both Athleague and Kildare Chilling. An investigation is continuing into the Athleague incident and there has been consequential locking up of farms; the situation is the same in Kildare. I am not certain of the situation regarding a consignment being turned away from the plant but I will get the details and communicate them directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to permits, the farmer concerned holds on to one part of the new permit, the transporter holds on to one part and the authorities at the final destination retain the third part. Regarding Deputy Penrose's question, I was going to wait to reply to him directly as he will have the chance to ask supplementary questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the work done on the permit from farm to factory, which is working out well, but what happens if a farmer outside Ballinasloe has in-lamb ewes ready to have their lambs on a fragmented farm near a wood? If he wants to bring those ewes to the safety of his farmyard so they can lamb under his care, is it possible for him to do so without authorisation? If he needs authorisation, who will give it and how long will it take? This will affect almost 100,000 farmers for one reason or another. Who will oversee this issue and how will it be done?</P>
      <P>Also, is it proper for fallen animals to be collected by people in the knackery trade? There are many problems with this around the country. Is it in order for a farmer with a fallen animal to engage the services of someone in the knackery trade to take the animal from his farm?</P>
      <P>How is it possible for almost 250 sheep to be killed in a factory without notice? Their ear tags were taken off and there were holes in their ears as a result. Have we reached the stage where there was a skin graft so that people would not see those holes? Can anyone explain how that could not be seen? It might have happened to one or two sheep but this was a huge lorry-load of sheep. How did that happen in a factory?</P>

      <P>Regarding susceptible animals, we banned movement within the State early last week and then introduced a permit or licensing system which, as the Deputy said, is working quite well. The kill in the country last week was one of the highest on record, approximately 50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of fragmented farms. We are arranging for a protocol to deal with this, which is a wise thing to do, but it will have to be done under controlled conditions and with the supervision of the Department. I am informed that protocol for the inter-farm transfer of animals will be available this evening.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of the knackery trade and fallen animals. We introduced an order some months ago to tidy that issue up, as it was a health risk in itself to leave fallen animals on farms. A proper procedure for collection was put in place and the position now is that there is no movement without a permit. That situation continues because obviously if an animal is lying around on a farm it will have to be taken to a licensed knackery and processed there.</P>
      <P>Regarding ear tags, in the ante-mortem tests there is no problem with cattle, as they are tagged and every single animal is checked individually through a cattle crush. It has been different up to now with sheep because there has not been official tagging, though there has been individual tagging and what are called &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; among individual flock owners. In many cases tags fall out, are mislaid or get lost, which is a big problem. We hope the introduction of an official tagging system will tidy this up and put matters on a proper basis. The ante-mortem tests for sheep were done on public health grounds. Up to this crisis, for the past decade since the introduction of the single market there has been free trade in sheep in Ireland. There is a great deal of interaction between industries; for example, many pigs go to processing plants north and south of the Border and a great deal of milk is processed in the same way. Only when something like this occurs the Border becomes a hazard and some tightening up has to be done.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks about TB and brucellosis reactor tests, which are very important. What further information can the Minister give me about the overnight slaughter of sheep in Monaghan? Are there more sheep to be slaughtered? Is the Minister satisfied sufficient measures are being taken along the Border? I am pleased with the <Col N="38" /> increased number of disinfection points along the Border.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that dog races are still taking place in Northern Ireland which I understand are supported by Bord na gCon? What liaison is taking place with the Northern Minister for Agriculture, Ms Bríd Rodgers, on this matter? I echo the question asked by others: is there sufficient contact between Ministers and between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister about the situation in the UK? The information we are getting about the UK's lackadaisical approach is very worrying.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Defence in the House. Is there sufficient liaison between the Departments of Defence, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enable action to be taken quickly? How many soldiers are on the Border? The Minister of State said the other day that there were only 200 soldiers there, though I understand the Taoiseach said something different. How many new disinfectant points have been put in place along the Border? Is the Minister aware that there are still serious problems regarding disinfectant? There are alternatives but some of them are not safe.</P>
      <P>Is there a limit to the distance animals can be taken to factories? In some situations it is difficult for farmers, especially smallholders, to cope with the new regulations whereby only one group of cattle can be transported in the lorry. That might need to be looked at again. Is the Government taking account of the serious situation for workers, hauliers and hotel owners in the Border region? Many people are under severe financial pressure as a result of the downturn in the economic situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question related to greyhound racing. Responsibility for animal movement and activities generally in the North of Ireland is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities. The Deputy also asked about contact with the authorities there. There is probably hourly, if not half hourly, contact between the Northern Ireland authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, particularly between the veterinary sections. Mr. Bob McCracken in the North and Dr. Gaynor in the South regularly share information on this matter. Similarly, although not on an hourly basis, the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland, Ms Bríd Rodgers, and I are in regular contact. We were in contact today and I am arranging to meet Ms Rodgers tomorrow, along with her senior officials and mine, to get an update on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is 100% co-operation and a sound degree of liaison among different Departments, State agencies and voluntary bodies. A task force meeting is held each morning. The meeting this morning was held at 11.30 a.m. and was attended by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith. With regard to Army support at checkpoints along the <Col N="39" /> Border, An Garda Síochána has responsibility for those. The Garda authorities tell me they are satisfied the checkpoints are adequately staffed and there are sufficient Army personnel to support the Garda. However, in the event of additional Army personnel being required, they will be available.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any shortage of disinfectants anywhere. There might be logistical problems in particular places. The Deputy said some disinfectants might not be adequate. We have widely publicised, through the Department, Teagasc and the co-ops, about 44 brands of disinfectant which destroy and inactivate this virus. They are relatively simple disinfectants ranging from caustic soda to citric acid. One matter which came up in the course of our discussions with various people was that some people do not dilute the disinfectant but put the concentrate on the mats, thereby getting rid of the mat, the soles of shoes and everything else. Dilution is required.</P>
    <P>There is no prescribed distance requirement for transporting cattle to the factory. Deputy Owen said in the House in the early days of this crisis that animals were travelling such distances as the distance from Donegal to Dublin. There is no need for that. We appeal to people to go to their nearest processing plant to ensure there is the least amount of traffic and criss-crossing throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>To comply with the Chair's ruling, I have a series of questions, all of them precise. What representations have been made to the British authorities regarding what many in this country see as an apparent failure to treat the outbreak of foot and mouth disease with the seriousness it deserves, as is illustrated by the decision to resume racing from tomorrow?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister received any indication from the British authorities as to the likely extent of the epidemic? Do they believe it has peaked? Do they believe the number of incidences, which has been growing at epidemic proportions, will continue to rise? How long will it be before the epidemic is likely to be brought under control, given that the last epidemic lasted nine months? Are the British authorities still insisting they have localised the source of the outbreaks and that there are links between the various outbreaks despite the dispersed geographical nature of the spread of the disease? Have they given any indication that the outbreaks are unconnected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many farms in the State are currently under restriction? What new powers were agreed by the Cabinet today? When will the relevant legislation be introduced and when will it take effect? What steps are being taken to deal with the shortages of disinfectant, reports of which are prevalent in the media today? There is anecdotal evidence of shortages in rural areas. What steps does the Government intend to take with regard to those who have ignored calls to cancel events which would attract large numbers of people? <Col N="40" /> Many sporting, cultural and voluntary organisations have cancelled events. Surely some of the large commercial ventures should also help by putting their shoulder to the wheel.</P>
    <P>What type of tagging system is being considered? Is it manual or electronic and when will it be introduced? Can the Minister give the House a categorical assurance that food products banned in the State are not still being supplied to supermarkets who operate on a central distribution basis? There are reports today that a truck carrying meat and dairy products for a supermarket chain to the south east was impounded for a period in relation to documentation. Is that true? Is there sufficient monitoring in this regard and, if not, what proposals does the Minister have to deal urgently with this situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about contact with the UK authorities. The Taoiseach spoke with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on a number of occasions, most recently today, to express anxiety about a number of matters, particularly sporting events and including Cheltenham. The Prime Minister agreed to have the matter looked into. I expect to have a discussion with the Agriculture Minister, Mr. Nick Brown, this afternoon arising from the discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, said, in the course of the conversation with the Taoiseach, that the British authorities are of the view that all cases in the UK are connected to the original case. It is hard to figure that out because they are so widely dispersed but that is the position as far as the British authorities are concerned. They believe with regard to the initial outbreak that a number of animals went through markets or marts and had contact with other animals. Animals are transported long distances and their assurance to us is that all the cases are connected.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to say whether the number of cases has peaked. There were further outbreaks today. The authorities feel the numbers are peaking but it will be another seven days before the situation is clear. The most recent information regarding France and Belgium is that, while antibodies were found, the tests have been negative.</P>
      <P>A total of 567 Irish farms are restricted. We are implementing an ultra precautionary regime. I have been assured as recently as one hour ago that there is no suspicion regarding any of these farms but we want to monitor the situation closely and ensure they are restricted. These farms are investigated by veterinary personnel and a virologist.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what tagging system will be used. I understand it is a manual system but some suggestions have been made&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> We have received a number of complaints regarding products which come into the country. Products which are properly heat treated under the regulations are allowed in. However, we receive complaints on the helplines about situations in which, for example, a mother is stopped at an airport or port and the baby's bottle is taken whereas a truck load of products for a supermarket chain is allowed through. All these cases are being followed up and we are ensuring that only products which are authorised and have proper certification come into the country.</P>
    <P>We have spoken to various voluntary bodies and sporting organisations from day one regarding this issue. In almost all cases they have co-operated. Last Sunday night was the first time in many years that Séan Óg Ó Cealleacháin did not have the GAA results. A meeting took place between the Department and the IRFU half an hour ago. We shared our concerns and the IRFU will deliberate and make a decision regarding the games against England and Scotland. I am sure that, in the national interest, it will do the right thing which is what it did regarding the game in Cardiff.</P>
    <P>The same applies to all gatherings which pose a risk. We are asking people not to hold such events but, if they must hold them, to have a restricted session and to observe the disinfectant and hygiene precautions, as has been done.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 1 March the Cabinet indicated that it would introduce powers to tighten up any weaknesses. Today's meeting approved a Bill to be introduced in the Seanad tomorrow. Members need to study the Bill which is being processed at the moment. I have a number of unofficial draft copies which I will circulate to spokespersons but the Bill will be published as quickly as possible.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Minister agree that the Athleague incident reinforces a discovery made by farming organisations in recent years regarding the wholesale and reckless movement of thousands of animals, particularly sheep, across the Irish Sea and the Border to factories in the Republic? Does he further agree that this exposes the fact that thousands of animals brought into the country in this way were accepted by meat processors and probably exported as Irish lamb? Why was this fraud allowed to continue? Why did the Minister seem to dismiss the gravity of this situation in a recent interview?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the case that, seven years after the beef tribunal report, certain meat processors are still the unreconstructed cowboys responsible for the malpractice in the meat industry which gave rise to that tribunal? What is the Minister going to do about this? What does he say to, for example, French consumers who buy what they think is Irish lamb but who find it is an impostor from England and Wales dressed up as Irish lamb and fraudulently put on their tables? The Govern<Col N="42" /> ment does not seem to appreciate the seriousness of this situation.</P>
    <P>The last outbreak of foot and mouth in Britain in 1967 was largely confined to Shropshire, parts of north Wales and north-west England. However, in a matter of weeks in 2001, well over 75 cases have been confirmed all over Britain. Will the Minister reflect on the observation I made in the past two weeks, an observation shared by the capitalist press to which he might listen more closely, regarding the intensification of agriculture to extremes in terms of methods, numbers and cruelty, and the insane practice of transporting animals 300 or 400 miles to factories instead of dealing with them locally? Will he reflect on the fact that these practices are creating conditions in which disease can spread like wildfire?</P>
    <P>Is he aware that Chancellor Schröder of Germany recently stated that he is in favour of rearing animals in a natural way using ecologically sound farming methods? We hope the present emergency will pass but will the Minister then encourage a debate on these issues and favour an agricultural practice and trade which is more in keeping with nature, ecosystems, natural methods and humane practices? Such an approach would have a significant impact in lessening the type of crisis which now exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases sheep are brought in from, for example, Scotland or part of Great Britain, spend time in the North of Ireland and are then taken across the Border for processing. The tagging system will improve traceability regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>I have never dismissed any illegal activities. When people peruse the proposed legislation they will see that our regulatory system will be tightened up considerably to address any weaknesses. I doubt if any EU member state has instigated so many prosecutions in the agricultural sector under existing legislation as Ireland.</P>
      <P>The majority of people in that sector, like every other sector, are honest, law abiding and hard working. One person whom I know is serving a long jail term for infecting his herd. Those small number of isolated cases must be rooted out.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the 1967 case in the UK, which was relatively localised, while the present case is geographically widespread. The reason is the amount of transportation of animals over long distances. There are strict animal welfare guidelines in relation to transport in place under EU directives, but long journeys still take place. My information from the UK authorities is that all the cases are connected with the original case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The Deputy also mentioned having a debate on intensive versus extensive agriculture. There is no doubt that would be of great therapeutic and economic value. Some people go back as far as Adam Smith &ndash; the Deputy would probably not agree with his theories &ndash; in the middle of the last century and the repeal of the corn laws which caused us many of the problems associated with free trade. I do not accept the intensification of agriculture has anything to do with foot and mouth disease. We must remember we had foot and mouth disease in Ireland 150 years ago and more recently in 1941 when we still had fairly primitive extensive agriculture. We had fairly widespread foot and mouth disease in 1941. In those days cattle were walked a lot of the time and they travelled by train. People used to have cattle in the Burren in County Clare and bring them up for finishing. I applaud extensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture, once it is properly done, has nothing to do with this disease. In most cases where the disease is prevalent in other countries it is extensive and fairly primitive agriculture that is carried out. The Deputy is correct that when intensive agriculture involves species which cannibalise one another we face difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that with hindsight he should acknowledge that his Department shirked its responsibility when it discovered that illegal imports of approximately 8,000 sheep were discovered in 1998? The matter was considered more appropriate for the Revenue Commissioners than for his Department. Does he accept that was a mistaken judgment by the Department and that it would not happen if it was discovered now?</P>
      <P>Has the Curragh crisis been resolved between the Minister and the Minister for Defence? Has he resolved the quandary for farmers who have sheep on the Curragh and who have been told by the Department of Defence that if they do not move their sheep, they will be shot, yet the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has told them not to move them?</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has said it does not have a problem with the census forms being delivered to farms on 29 April as long as there are mats in place. How is it possible to organise a census against the background of movement restrictions? An example is being set by officers of the State which suggests those restrictions are qualified.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us when mats were in place in the airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon and in the regional airports? There has been much debate on this issue. The Minister lauded Cork Airport on the television last night but he did not answer the question. Has he categorical information about when mats were put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For both humane and animal health reasons and to avoid unnecessarily long distance travel, is <Col N="44" /> the Minister in favour of reversing the trend of closing small abattoirs and putting in place the necessary regulations to ensure they are able to operate to the highest standards which will in turn reduce the unnecessary transportation of animals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been free trade in sheep on the island of Ireland. In 1997 and 1998 a study was carried out on the amount of traffic and it showed it was fairly widespread, along the lines suggested by the Deputy. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was asked to look into one aspect of it, namely, if VAT was being paid on it. The Department made representations and communicated with the Revenue Commissioners. If the Deputy wants any more information on the veracity of that, he can get it from me or he can use the freedom of information system because it is all on file and above board. Anyone who tried to make publicity out of it was incorrect.</P>
      <P>As regards the effectiveness of the Border, I have been assured as late as this morning that it is effective. There is no evidence that any illegal imports have come across the Border since the ban was put in place. I was asked earlier about the number of Army personnel involved. There are more than 1,000 Army personnel available to the gardaí and they work on a rotation basis of 200.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the Curragh crisis. The sheep have become a <i>cause célèbre </i>in this matter. Their visits to public houses and other such places have raised the awareness of sheep traversing the Curragh and communicating with people. It is probably a Kildare type experience. I understand there are approximately 6,000 sheep there. Within a short time of this issue being brought to the attention of the Department of Defence and myself, 4,500 were put in a restricted access area. The rest of the problem has now been resolved. We also had to take into account the fact that it discommoded the Curragh golf club.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the census. I will have to check that for the Deputy because I am not sure about it. The Deputy took on the mantle of John Bowman following &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last night. I took the opportunity to say what an outstanding job the people in Cork Airport did. I would like that to go on the record of the House. The same can also be said about other entry points. As regards disinfectant mats and the precautions people are taking to prevent this virus from coming into the country, we would have to go back to St. Patrick to get a better way of keeping a virus out of the country.</P>

It is suggested that nobody searched their luggage for shoes or some other item. It is the bounden duty of every citizen to co-operate in keeping this virus out of the country and I have asked them to do that from day one. If those who went to the media had any real regard for the problem they would co-operate fully, as the majority of people are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am led to believe that even today some farmers and business people have not put down the necessary disinfectant facilities at their gates. Should an order be made compelling them to do so? It is the time of year for letting out stock and many farmers from Border counties have rented land in County Meath. What is the position concerning cattle or sheep being let out on land at present?</P>

      <P>We have issued specific instructions about agri-products that can come into the country. Those instructions can be downloaded from the Department's website and they are also available to all staff at ports and airports. They are quite specific concerning heat treatment and the general pasteurisation of dairy products. They are the only products that can come in. We have had a fair amount of communication from the general public about this, which illustrates that there is a high degree of awareness of the problem.</P>

      <Col N="46" /> There are strict guidelines on the use of disinfected mats and straw bedding at farm entrances. Teagasc has helped considerably on this matter through its local offices. We expect that farmers, being in the front line, will be the first to co-operate, and the majority of them have done so. I have received complaints that some of the mats are too small to cope with big-wheeled tractors and do not cover the full circumference of the wheels. Because of this we have advised farmers to provide larger mats. The local media, including radio, have been exceptionally helpful in this regard. Teagasc personnel and other experts have taken part in helpline programmes and question and answer sessions to help people.</P>
    <P>The Department's control centre in Agriculture House has received a number of queries about fragmented farms. Guidelines and regulations on such farms will be available this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say he will be speaking to his British counterpart, Mr. Nick Brown, later today. Does the Minister intend to speak to Mr. Brown about more than just sporting events? Will the Minister raise with Mr. Brown the concerns that we on this side of the Irish Sea have about the laxity of controls on the movement of animals in the UK? This still seems to be causing a problem and constitutes a serious danger to us. Can the Minister be more specific than his usual genial helpful self, in saying that he might have copies of the draft of the bill for Opposition spokespersons. Will he tell us when the bill will be published? Is it realistic to have a bill debated in the Seanad tomorrow that the Minister cannot give us this afternoon?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of reports that in some district veterinary offices large numbers of movement permits were already being prepared at the weekend? What degree of confidence can we have in the control of movements if large numbers of permits have already been prepared without any reference to the destinations of the animals?</P>

      <P>I will have further discussions with the British Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Nick Brown, this afternoon when I will speak to him about a range of matters. In earlier discussions I raised issues such as the arrangements at airports. As we know, when people travel on planes they go through tunnels and all congregate in one area. It is much easier to have mats there rather than when they come off the planes and are dispersed to various locations. The British authorities have been helpful in a whole range of matters like that. I will take up with Mr. Brown matters other than racing, including the Deputy's suggestions.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ms Bríd Rodgers, indicated yesterday that additional sheep, other than those destroyed at Meigh and brought to Roscommon, were part of the Carlisle contingent imported into Northern Ireland? Ms Rodgers also indicated that it was the belief of her authorities that these sheep were kept in another part of Armagh and then moved into the Republic. Last Friday, the Minister informed me that he was satisfied that no illegal importation of susceptible livestock &ndash; the Minister's words &ndash; had taken place since 21 February. Is he still satisfied that is the position? Is he satisfied that these sheep which have been in contact with the diseased animals discovered at Meigh, were brought to the Republic? Did that movement take place on or after 21 February as Ms Rodgers seems to suggest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are aware, any of the susceptible animals &ndash; sheep in this case &ndash; that we have found came into the Republic before the ban came into effect. I have been assured by the Garda Síochána who have been staffing checkpoints on the Border since the ban came into place on 21 February, that they have no record or evidence of any illegal importations since then. Our difficulty with sheep is seeking to ensure that no sheep that had contact with other sheep &ndash; in other words at a mart or market &ndash; are in the country and on farms at the moment. That is why we have in excess of 500 farms under surveillance and restricted. We are following every possible lead. To answer the Deputy's question specifically, there is no evidence that any illegal susceptible animals have come into the country since the ban was put in place.</P>

What was their location in the UK prior to their importation, what route did the lorries transporting them here take, who took responsibility for any associated administration for monitoring the management of these horses before and after their arrival here, who regulates their movement now and how is it policed? From where did the bedding for these horses come and how was it disposed of and disinfected? Were the transport vehicles disinfected and, if so, who monitored the disinfection process?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the precautions currently in place for monitoring any cattle, sheep or pigs on farms located near the properties on which these horses are being kept, given that the infective dose is very low and that the incubation period is approximately 14 days? Has any restriction zone been introduced in respect of these horses &ndash; as is the case in relation to sheep imported the same period &ndash; and, if not, why?

      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that adequate disinfection and sterilisation will take place at the Kepak plant in Athleague prior to the resumption of processing there? Will he subject the plant to an independent audit to ensure that such disinfection and sterilisation has taken place? I make this request in the aftermath of recent television pictures which showed birds picking at the entrails of dead animals.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister restore the numbers of veterinary inspection personnel in County Galway given that a number of such personnel have been placed on duty at the Border? County Galway is a prospective flashpoint because the owners of up to 100 farms there were in contact with people from or actually visited Athleague and Kildare. The owners of these farms are concerned and their properties must be inspected. Is there a director of veterinary inspection in this country and, if so, is he, rather than a deputy spokesperson for the veterinary services, responsible for making pronouncements regarding the current position <i>vis-à-vis</i> this crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boylan raised the question of Willie McCrea. There is no substance or foundation to the allegations made by Rev. McCrea. They are downright untrue. When suspect animals are found in this jurisdiction, if they have had, or it is suspected they had, contact with animals from Northern Ireland or Carlisle &ndash; from where the original consignments came &ndash; they are slaughtered as a precaution. In addition, blood and tissue samples are taken from each animal and these are sent to the international reference laboratory in Surrey. I am sure Rev. McCrea is confident about and satisfied with the activities of that institution. To date, tests on samples from such slaughtered animals have been negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been illegal activity of all kinds and of a peculiar nature on both sides of the Border for a considerable period. I am assured that there are adequate numbers of staff stationed at check-points. I note Deputy Boylan's congratulatory remarks to these people who, as stated on many occasions, have endured a considerable amount of abuse. I am surprised about the origin of some of that abuse because since 21 February these <Col N="51" /> people have been working in temperatures of minus eight degrees centigrade. They are doing an outstanding job and I welcome the Deputy's remarks about these people, quite a number of whom are volunteers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton inquired about the importation of horses before the introduction of the ban. The information available to me indicates that horses do not contract this infection, nor do they spread it. That information comes from the highest authority, namely, the chief veterinary officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can they carry the disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this is a matter of considerable debate. I made specific inquiries about this matter because the information I received indicates that, on rare occasions, it can lodge in the tonsils. However, the tonsils of horses are not appropriate to the discussion on a special notice question which commenced 90 minutes ago. At any rate, a ban was put on horses because of the good points the Deputy made, namely, the risk surrounding the bedding and the vehicles, particularly if they come in contact with susceptible animals. I have been told there is complete isolation of the horses concerned and any susceptible animals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if responsibility for food safety would be transferred from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Responsibility for food safety rests with the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. Anybody who was here during the debate on the food safety legislation will know there was not full agreement in the House. In fact, it was the Fianna Fáil Party, in our programme for Government, which insisted on this area going to the Department of Health and Children, and that is where it will stay.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coveney asked about Willie McCrea's inaccurate and unhelpful comments and if I had taken up the matter with the authorities in the North. I said earlier that I will meet the Minister, Ms Bríd Rodgers, tomorrow and some of her senior staff and I will discuss a range of matters with her.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of disinfecting and fumigating the plant in Athleague. I have been assured that that was done adequately and to the satisfaction of the veterinary supervisors. The Deputy also asked about the level of veterinary personnel. I think he made representations about that matter yesterday because I happened to be in the control room at the time. Those representations were followed up immediately and I hope we will be able to sort out the concerns the Deputy had in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The Deputy asked if we had a director of veterinary services. We have a chief veterinary officer who is the director of veterinary services, Dr. Colm Gaynor, an extremely competent and professional person. In the course of the extraordinary effort put in by the veterinary officers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, their staff and many other Departments also, he lost his voice to some extent. That is one of the reasons he has not been doing some of the radio interviews but I have the fullest of confidence in his deputy directors and the deputy chief veterinary officers in the Department. They have been manfully carrying out their duties and communicating with people over a wide range of networks.</P>

I am not talking about the entrance to the airport but the aprons where the planes taxi in.

      <P>The Minister acknowledged the role of local radio, and local media, in disseminating the information and alerting the general public on the importance of taking precautionary measures, etc. Will the Department ensure in future that the agency charged with placing public notice advertisements about foot and mouth disease does not disregard the provincial press in the way it has done heretofore?

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for inadvertently missing Deputy Farrelly's substantial questions.</P>
      <P>The Athleague staff conduct ante and post-mortem checks on animals, as is done in every factory, North and South. There is free trade for some animals, particularly sheep and pigs. Last year there was a problem because of the fire in an abattoir in the North. The free trade ended with the recent ban.</P>
      <P>Trucks containing things like compost for the mushroom industry, swill and other risk products have been turned back by security forces on this side of the Border. The information I have is that there was no illegal transport of susceptible animals into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen asked about the location of two lambs. That is difficult to answer because the <Col N="55" /> responsibility for that is outside the jurisdiction of the State. A consignment of lambs was acquired by a North of Ireland dealer in Carlisle market. We contacted the authorities there about numbers to be told that they weighed them. The same situation prevails in the North. It is unsatisfactory that a triple layered truck carrying up to 300 lambs is enumerated by weight. We are satisfied the movement of sheep or lambs from the North, the sheep themselves and those in contact with other sheep at markets have been tracked, as far as possible. Investigations continue into smuggling, which is mentioned for the first time in relation to this issue. We cannot be 100% sure that an animal may turn up at some point but we are satisfied that will not be so.</P>
    <P>The permit is quite specific and contains a definable code for full traceability. I am not an expert on codes but this was drawn up in co-operation with the Garda who are.</P>
    <P>Smuggling, an issue raised by Deputy Belton, continues, but the measures we are introducing will attempt to root it out. It is endemic in all border regions. Every effort is being made to eradicate it and when the Legislation is introduced to the Seanad tomorrow, Members will see that there are long gaol sentences, substantial fines and confiscation of property for those found guilty.</P>
    <P>I have always paid the highest tribute, by name to the Opposition, to Deputies Penrose and Dukes in particular, both inside and outside the House for their constructive contributions and we accepted their suggestions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerry Reynolds asked about crossing the Border. I am assured by the Garda and the Army that there is no evidence of illegal transport of animals into the State. I have not contacted the Director of Consumer Affairs but will do so about a disinfectant racket and the raising of prices as it has been brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>Hygiene at airports was raised by Deputy Ryan. The British now believe that their outbreak started because food from foreign planes was put into improperly monitored or unpasteurised pig swill. I believe that at our airports there is disinfectant at lay-by points, but will inquire further.</P>

      <P>I have been through Dublin Airport since the ban was imposed and there are announcements on the planes and signs throughout the airport. No one has an excuse for not knowing about the risk of foot and mouth disease and taking the necessary precautions. Individuals are responsible for doing this.</P>
      <P>Leaflets are given out on trains, especially the Belfast-Dublin train. I will ask Iarnród Éireann and Aer Rianta at the task force meeting to ensure that all precautionary measures, including disinfectant, are in place.</P>

I was always berated by Deputy Noonan's colleagues &ndash; he was not leader of his party at that stage. It was always said that I had to give answers in the House and we could not wait for people to be called before the tribunals.

We are all being damaged by that. If the Taoiseach has legal advice to the effect that to ban corporate donations is unconstitutional will he please agree to publish it? Will he ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to lift the veto he has imposed undemocratically on the chairman, Deputy Healy-Rae, and allow that committee to discuss the Bill which was passed without division in the House last May, informed with the legal advice?

      <P>We on this side of the House are happy, at any stage, to continue to discuss the matters we endeavoured to discuss last year. The Public Offices Commission Bill and all the other issues went to committees of the House and all were agreed. For better or for worse the legislation was passed. I stated the Government had no difficulty and would continue to do what we had been doing when the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and I met the then leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, and Deputy Quinn. The difficulty, as rightly stated by Deputy Quinn, was that he wished to impose a pre-condition. I did not then accept a pre-condition nor do I now. However, I accept we cannot continue as we have over the years. Perhaps times were different, but that does not make corporate donations any better. They were wrong &ndash; there were major difficulties around corporate funds and big money. As in the recent case if a donation is given by an individual and passed from a company through Jersey and back here to Baggot Street, it does not matter whether it is corporate or otherwise. The problem is not corporate but big donations which are perceived to be wrong. <Col N="66" /> That is the issue. I am ready and willing as I was last April, to sit down and talk about the definitions of &ldquo;corporate donation&rdquo; the size of it and so on. Had it been done last April it would have been finished, the amendments would have been agreed and the Public Offices Commission Bill, which the Minister for Finance has before the House, would be dealt with.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider an amendment from the Seanad.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Section 60: In page 48, lines 35 to 39 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(4) In considering the suitability of an applicant for the award of a sound broadcasting contract, the Commission shall have regard to the overall quality of the performance of the applicant with respect to the provision by him of a sound broadcasting service under any sound broadcasting contract held by him at, or before, the date of the making of the application.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may recall that during Report Stage I introduced an amendment inserting a new section which would require the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to take the past performance of a local radio operation into account when deciding to renew a sound broadcasting contract. The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, brought some problems of detail with the amendment to my attention and I held further discussions with the IBI on the matter. As a result I decided to refine the provision passed in the Dáil by introducing a further amendment in the Seanad. The IBI has confirmed it is pleased to support the amendment. I hope the House will also support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad the Minister has reached agreement with the IBI on the amendment. Fine Gael supported its position when the Bill was passing through both Houses. While we welcome the amendment, it does not go far enough. Local radio licences were granted originally for ten years but some operators have exceeded that term. Many local radio operators <Col N="70" /> are in limbo and do not know whether they will be granted a new licence when they apply. That will be bad for local radio because some of those who invested in local radio mortgaged their houses or used their life savings. They have provided an excellent service throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I refer to Donegal where we have two local radio stations, North West Radio and Highland Radio. They have carved out 60% to 70% of the radio audience in Donegal and that demonstrates the massive vote of confidence they have gained in the region. While radio stations are in such an uncertain phase it is difficult to plan for the future and to make decisions on whether to invest in digital radio. Local radio operators cannot make important decisions unless they can plan ahead.</P>
      <P>The performances of local radio licensees since they were awarded their licences should be taken into consideration. They should be allowed to continue automatically unless there is something seriously wrong or there has been misconduct. Their licences should be renewed because they provide an excellent service. The Minister agreed the amendment with the IBI and, while I support it, it does not go far enough. If the licence holder is doing an excellent job and has the confidence of the people there is no reason the licence should not be automatically renewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this issue long and hard on Committee and Report Stages. While this amendment does not go as far as the Labour Party wished it has the approval of the IBI. We will not be opposing it at this stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the ongoing representations from the organisations which represent the deaf. We tabled an amendment on Committee and Report Stages which was not accepted by the Minister. However, I understand the Minister gave an undertaking in the Seanad that she would write to the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland asking it to deal with this as a matter of urgency. It would be a matter of great comfort to the organisations representing the deaf if the Minister reiterated that commitment in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister take further action on that issue, other than writing to the commission? Could she find a way to make subtitling statutory, as it is available in other countries? The Minister will be aware of the ongoing campaign. It seems to make a great amount of sense and would make broadcasting much more accessible for very large numbers of people. It is quite surprising that such statutory provision has not been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies who have sought such provision for the deaf. On Committee Stage the Minister would not accept an amendment. Since then the people who suffer from the affliction feel very let down. I do not know exactly what the Minister will do but a <Col N="71" /> change is required, especially given the new channels which will result from digital television. Ordinary people will have great facilities whereas those who suffer from deafness will have a limited service, if any. I appeal to the Minister, even at this last minute, to again examine this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by previous speakers. I ask the Minister to again examine this matter and to make subtitling statutory, if possible. There are about 500,000 people suffering from deafness who would benefit significantly from the subtitling of programmes. While the assurance the Minister has given about writing to the commission is welcome, putting such provision on a statutory basis would be much more beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Deputy McGinley said he believes the amendment does not go far enough. However, I think he will recognise that this amendment has been agreed in writing with the IBI, and I have sent a copy of the documentation to Deputies McGinley and O'Shea as spokespersons for their respective parties.</P>
      <P>I again emphasise that the matter of digital audio broadcasting &ndash; DAB &ndash; is not referred to in the Bill. We must draw up a policy on DAB before we have legislation. Separate legislation is necessary to that being discussed.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the abolition of the 3% levy in terms of local radio and the £500,000 fund. All those involved in politics, in particular those involved in rural Ireland, have only positive things to say about local radio as was clear from the debate on this Bill, particularly on Committee Stage. The relevant legislation was introduced by Fianna Fáil when in Government and has been a great boon to broadcasting. I do not agree with Deputy McGinley's call for automatic licences. I am sure the Deputy will understand that frequency is a finite resource and that there could not be roll-over or automatic licence, a principle which I think has been understood. Deputy O'Shea said that he and his party would like to see a stronger provision but that they will not oppose the amendment given the agreement which exists.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea also raised the issue of those who are deaf or hard of hearing. I have had an opportunity to meet with some of those who have particular concerns in this regard and we discussed it in both Houses. In the Seanad I gave an undertaking to write to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, which I have already done, to put the point on record. Not only did I state that examining subtitling was a matter of urgency in my own opinion, but that this was the wish of the Seanad. As Deputies are aware, the amendment tabled in the Seanad by the Opposition was withdrawn on the understanding that I would undertake to write that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Fitzgerald will accept that this is the first time the deaf or hard of hearing have <Col N="72" /> been referred to in broadcasting legislation. I wanted to take the opportunity to set down a very important marker as to our future direction and that action must be taken as a matter of urgency. While I understand the views expressed by Deputies Fitzgerald, Carey and Healy, the approach I have adopted is the best at this time. I have given an undertaking that the first priority for the new commission will be to examine a code for standards in advertising in the context of children, which has been accepted by all Members. I have undertaken and followed through on my commitment in the Seanad to ensure my views and those of the Oireachtas are made known and to express the wish that the commission takes on the issue of subtitling and the issues relevant to those who are deaf or hard of hearing as a matter or urgency.</P>

However, the ideal solution would have been a statutory amendment, and we very much regret that the Minister did not see fit to proceed in this way. Will she indicate whether she has had a response from the Independent Radio and Television Commission, what it will do or whether it will act in accordance with her wishes? If no response has been received, how soon can one be expected? If provision was included in the Bill it would be bound by statute to act. Does the Independent Radio and Television Commission have to respond to the letter from the Minister? These are important issues in terms of meeting the needs of the hundreds of thousands of people who have difficulty understanding and following our news services and other programmes.</P>

      <P>I undertook in the Seanad to report the feelings expressed there in a letter to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. That response was agreed in the Seanad and it was on foot of that response that the Opposition amendment was withdrawn. Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned subtitling, which is a matter of great interest to the Government.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I will not go over all the ground traversed on Committee Stage regarding this amendment but I will look deeper into the Minister of State's objections to my amendment on Committee Stage. He quoted the Constitution and a High Court judgment known as the Abbott and Whelan case. The purpose of the amendment is to amend the Long Title of the Bill and to make it a Bill which would require employers to recognise and negotiate with trade unions and excepted bodies. Amendment No. 2, if put into law, would have the effect of compelling an employer to recognise and negotiate with a trade union or excepted body where such trade union or excepted body notifies the employer in writing that it represents part or all of the work force who are its members.</P>
      <P>I remind the Government that the genesis of this Bill occurred after the Ryanair strike, which is now notorious in the memories of trade union activists and workers in general, when a recalcitrant employer absolutely refused to negotiate with the trade union representing the baggage handlers. Unfortunately, the Government, in discussion with the bosses' union, IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it must be said, watered down the original intention of the Bill and changed it into meaningless legislation. I have studied this further and discussed the matter with others since Committee Stage and am now convinced this is useless legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State voted down my amendment, which would have required a full-blooded trade union rights recognition Bill to be brought into law, and he justified this by citing the Abbott and Whelan High Court judgment in 1980. I have looked into the background of that case and its constitutional implications. Abbott and Whelan were workers for the Southern Health Board and moved from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union to the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union. The Southern Health Board refused to negotiate with the ATGWU so they took the case to the High Court and asked the court to compel the Southern Health Board to enter into negotiations with them through the ATGWU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Green Party for cosigning this motion with the Labour Party. In July 1997, almost four years ago, Deputy Dempsey was appointed Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace were appointed Ministers of State at that Department. The Programme for Government which accompanied their appointments declared: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are committed to the deeply held ideal of so many Irish people &ndash; home ownership&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the time of their appointment, the average national price of a new house was £73,523. Today, the average price of a new house is £133,459, an increase of 82%. On the day the Minister was first driven to his new office in the Custom House, the average price of a new house in Dublin was £84,001. Today it is £173,739, an increase of 107%. Take the case of two young teachers who got their first permanent jobs on the same day the Minister was appointed. They would now be on point six of the common basic scale and, adding their degree allowance, they would now have a salary of £20,000 each. The maximum home loan they would get from any lending institution would be three times their combined income, that is three times £40,000 or £120,000, far short of the amount needed to buy a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might ask if they have some savings. They might have had savings if they had not been rent<Col N="77" /> ing accommodation for the past four years. The flat or house which they could have rented for £400 to £500 per month at the start of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's, reign now costs £800 to £1,000 per month. For the first time in the history of the State, young professional couples, such as teachers, gardaí, nurses, public servants, industrial supervisors and managers, can no longer afford to buy a home. In less than four years the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, the housing face of this Fianna Fáil-PD Government, have turned the dream of home ownership into a nightmare hunt for affordable accommodation.</P>
    <P>Tonight, the Minister will tell us again that house prices are moderating and that the Government's housing policies are working. That blind message has been the only consistent characteristic of this Government's housing policy and it has been consistently wrong. On 22 July 1999, the ministerial press release latched on to a survey published by the Irish Permanent Building Society and declared: &ldquo;These figures back up what I have been saying for some time about moderation in house prices . . . &rdquo;. Since then the average price of a new house has increased by more than £20,000.</P>
    <P>On 5 January 2000, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, criticised the reporting of a house price survey by a firm of auctioneers which claimed that house prices would rise by 20% in the year 2000. &ldquo;The coverage of such surveys once again shows a selective reporting of facts by certain newspapers to produce sensationalist articles&rdquo;, thundered the Minister. A recent survey has demonstrated that prices rose by just over the 20% predicted in that study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The price moderation spin from the Minister is missing the point. Tens of thousands of young couples have already been forced out of the housing market by the failure of this Government to contain house prices. Even if house price rises were to slow down now to the rate of inflation or the rate of pay movement, our two young teachers would still not be able to buy and would have to wait until their mid thirties before their salaries would have progressed to a point where they could afford to buy a house.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues have rejected the many proposals made by the Labour Party to deal with the housing crisis, including our proposals for publicly owned land banks, a national housing authority, fair price certification, legislation to protect tenants and house buyers and for a major social housing programme. Instead, they continue to insist that housing is a market problem and that if supply is increased, prices will moderate. Housing output has doubled since the mid 1990's and stood at almost 50,000 last year. However, house prices continued to rise.</P>

    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey's, interventions in the housing market have been consist<Col N="78" /> ently on the side of the builder, developer and landowner, rather than on the side of the house buyer. He provided taxpayers' money to service building land, increased the density of housing which could be permitted and simplified the planning procedures. In an effort to encourage land hoarders to release building land, his Government halved the capital gains tax on residential land from 40% to 20% with a proviso that it would rise to 60% after four years, a classic carrot and stick approach. However, in this year's Finance Bill the stick is removed and land speculators, many of whom have already made massive gains from land rezoning, will now pay a lower rate of tax than a worker on the minimum wage. The net effect of the Minister's interventions in the housing market has been to put more money into the coffers of developers and landowners and to take more money out of the pockets of house buyers.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues have made owning a home a luxury. Small wonder that during his term of office the numbers of applicants on council waiting lists have grown to unprecedented levels. When the Minister took office, there were 26,000 applicants for local authority housing. In the assessment of housing needs undertaken in March 1999, this had grown to 39,176. Last year, the Minister admitted that the figure would have increased by a further 15% over the year, and we can assume that it would have grown by a further 15% over the past 12 months, bringing to more than 50,000 the numbers now seeking council housing. The March 1999 assessment showed, however, that the number of applicants seeking all forms of social housing, including shared ownership and Traveller accommodation, was already 50,000 and, applying the Minister's own estimated rate of increase, that means there are now more than 60,000 applicants for all forms of social housing on council waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the number of council houses being provided has decreased. In 1999, 2,909 council houses were provided, fewer than the number in 1995. In the first nine months of 2000, only 1,201 council houses were completed, 50% less than in the corresponding period in 1999. The Minister has yet to publish the full figures for 2000, but it is clear that while private house building is sweeping ahead, the output of council housing is falling further and further behind. The Minister will no doubt respond that he has increased the financial allocation and the numbers of approved starts for local authority housing but that does not convert into real houses unless local authorities have the land, the professional support, the project management and the contractors which will enable them to build the houses. That is what the Labour Party has been telling the Minister for the past two years and, more recently, the NESF has told him that a national housing authority is required.</P>
    <P>So far the Minister has failed to respond, leaving young families languishing on waiting lists, <Col N="79" /> living in overcrowded conditions with their families or being exploited in the unregulated private rented sector. Some have literally ended up on the street. During the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's, four years in office, the number of homeless people in this rich country has doubled. According to the Homeless Initiative, there are now 1,000 children homeless in Dublin. They stay overnight in hostels and bed and breakfasts with a parent &ndash; usually the mother &ndash; and are forced back out for the day to trudge around the streets and public parks of the city before returning in the evening. These children are the innocents suffering for the failure of the Minister's housing policy.</P>
    <P>Many of the new homeless are families who have been evicted from private rented accommodation. Threshold handled 341 illegal evictions in Dublin alone last year. In addition, there are the legal evictions Threshold did not hear about and the many evictions secured by landlords in the courts. In 21st century Ireland, where history teaches of the cruel landlords of the 19th century, tenants enjoy little or no legal protection. The Labour Party and organisations such as Threshold and Focus Ireland have called on the Government to introduce legislation to regulate the private rented sector. The commission on the private rented sector was established in June 1999 and reported last July. The Government did not respond until January this year and then announced that the measures in the commission report which benefited landlords would be introduced immediately in the Finance Bill but that tenants would have to wait for another two years for the legislation to protect their rights.</P>

      <P>This separation of landlords' benefit and tenants' rights flies in the face of the approach taken by the commission, whose recommendations were presented as a package. It also stands on its head the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, when announcing the establishment of the commission on 24 June 1999. He said: &ldquo;I am of the view that the issue of security of tenure cannot appropriately be considered in isolation from other issues such as rents, supply and quality of accommodation, investment return and market considerations and existing constraints to the development of the sector &ndash; all of which impact on the optimum operation of the private rented sector&rdquo;. Why, then, has the legislation been postponed until mid 2002 when, one way or the other, this Government's term of office will have expired? The message is simple. This Fianna Fáil-PD Government will not introduce legislation to protect tenants. If the 150,000 tenants in this country were corporate donors to Fianna Fáil, they would not have to wait two years for their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing crisis is one of this Government's biggest failures and the Minister for the Envir<Col N="80" /> onment and Local Government has overall responsibility for it. However, that is by no means his only failure. He has also failed on planning. The Planning and Development Act which he declared contained &ldquo;radical new measures in relation to housing supply, particularly the provision of social and affordable housing&rdquo;, has still not produced a single affordable house and will not do so for at least another two years, as was predicted by the Labour Party at the time of its publication. Most local authorities will not be able to adopt housing strategies until at least the middle of this year. In addition, they will not have revised their development plans until early next year and will not apply the new 20% land provision until well into 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act was passed last summer and declared constitutional by the Supreme Court in July. However, most of it has yet to be commenced by the Minister. The reason for this delay is the critical shortage of planning staff throughout the system. According to a recent Dáil reply, there are now 328 professional planners in the system, less than half the number required, as estimated by the IPI. The result is that in some local authorities, planning decisions are made by staff other than planners, An Bord Pleanála has had to engage private consultants to assess planning appeals and there are lengthy delays and inconsistencies in making planning decisions.</P>
      <P>Many of the so-called reforms in the new planning Act are against the public interest, including the decision, yet to be implemented, to charge the public for its democratic right to write to a local council about a planning matter.</P>
      <P>At a wider level, the Minister has also failed in the planning of the country itself. The national development plan which will determine the physical development of this country into the new century contains £40 billion of proposed investment and is just a compendium of individual projects. The Minister has failed to locate this planned investment in infrastructure in any vision for the future of the country. To some extent he appears to have acknowledged the deficiency because on 29 September 1999 he announced the drawing up of a national spatial strategy. Eighteen months later there is still no sign of the promised strategy and the Minister would be well advised to adopt the draft spatial plan Vision of Ireland published by the Labour Party at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister's failure to integrate housing, planning and transport is to be experienced every day in the oppressive traffic in our cities and on our over-crowded and dangerous roads. With the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Minister shares responsibility for traffic gridlock and the lack of public transport. This Minister has failed, for example, to legislate to regulate the epidemic of road openings by service providers which is contributing to the traffic chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> The Minister has also failed to publish the long promised legislation on road safety. On 31 July 1998 he and the Taoiseach announced the preparation of legislation to develop a penalty points system for driving offences. Two and a half years later the legislation, which was apparently approved by Cabinet last July, has not been published. Even when it is published, the national driver file, which will give effect to the measure, will not be ready until the end of this year at the latest.</P>
    <P>The Minister's lethargy in addressing the life and death issue of road safety is best described by the chairman of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, who, on 22 December 2000, unequivocally criticised the Government for launching a strategy with no budget. Mr. Shaw described State funding as being in bits and pieces and all over the place, and stated that road deaths were twice what they should have been by international comparison and that if the strategy was on target, 50 people who had died so far that year would be alive. Has there ever been a more damning criticism of a Minister by the chairman of a State agency?</P>
    <P>The commuter stuck in one of Deputy Dempsey's traffic jams has plenty of time to reflect on another of the Minister's 15 failures &ndash; his failure to effectively tackle the scourge of litter. Before the general election, Deputy Dempsey promised to wage war on litter. Instead, we now have a web competition for the dirtiest town in Ireland organised by business people who are understandably embarrassed at the filthy appearance of our towns, cities and countryside.</P>
    <P>On 19 August 1999 the Minister declared war on plastic bags and told an impressed gathering of journalists that the day of the plastic bag was coming to an end. That has been a very long day because despite repeated announcements, his promise to put a tax on plastic bags has yet to materialise. It was to have been implemented by the beginning of this year. Then it was to have been in the Finance Bill. Now we are told to await the publication of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill some time later this year.</P>
    <P>This new Waste Management Bill is itself becoming a bit of a mystery. No amount of Dáil questions can prise from the Minister a straight answer as to what it is for. We continue to speculate that his intention is to remove from local authorities the effective decision making on the location of dumps and incinerators. The Bill is a belated response to a growing crisis in waste management on which the Minister has not given any leadership during his four years in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, continue living with this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 the Minister published a waste management strategy called Changing Our Ways which established ambitious targets for recycling. However, he has failed to put in place <Col N="82" /> any significant recycling infrastructure. In reply to a Dáil question on the subject on Thursday, 22 February, he told me that only £7.1 million had been spent on the provision of a recycling infrastructure since January 1997. Given that £650 million has been allocated in the NDP for waste infrastructure, the low level of spending on recycling confirms the Minister is paying lip service to the waste management hierarchy, that his real agenda is the construction of five or six regional incinerators and that the new Bill is intended to smooth a path for their introduction. In the meantime the waste mountain is growing, landfill dumps are closing, the EU is tightening the noose on our bad waste practices and industry is becoming increasingly concerned at the absence of a national waste strategy and of ministerial leadership and action on this crucial issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister's failure on waste management is one of the more obvious examples of his failure to protect the country's environment which was entrusted to his care almost four years ago. Deputy Dempsey's failure to protect the environment will soon result in Ireland facing international embarrassment and, possibly, massive fines at the European Court. According to the EU environment director general, James Currie, Ireland, with just 1% of the population of the European Union, now accounts for 10% of the Commission's environmental complaints. There is a queue of EU legal actions against Ireland for failure to protect our own environment.</P>
      <P>According to a Dáil reply on 22 February there are two cases, dealing with waste management and water quality, before the European Court of Justice for hearing. European Court proceedings are being initiated in two other cases. There are a further six cases on which reasoned opinions have been given under Article 226 of the treaty. Another 11 complaints are being investigated under Articles 226 and 228 and a further 17 cases are the subject of correspondence with the Commission.</P>

      <P>The Minister has repeatedly replied that he responds promptly to Commission complaints and he has even suggested in one Dáil reply that he initiated the correspondence. That is not how the EU Environment Commissioner sees it. In a recent 19-page letter dated 9 February 2001 addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Commissioner Wallstro1m complained angrily about the lack of action and response from our Minister for the Environment and Local Government over a litany of environmental complaints. In respect of 11 complaints, the Commissioner stated in a letter dated 29 August 2000, that the Commission wrote to the Irish authorities in relation to complaints, details of which were given. The date for responding to the letter was 29 October 2000 but that, to date, no response had been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it should not be necessary for the European Commission to take this country to the <Col N="83" /> European Court to force the Minister to protect our environment. Surely clean air, clean water, sustainable environmental practices and good physical planning are so obvious that the Minister should be seeing to them in our own interest, without being forced to do so by our European partners.</P>
    <P>The laws of the European Union are not the only international obligations on which Deputy Dempsey is lagging behind. Another is our failure to honour commitments under the Kyoto protocolumn On 22 June 1998 the Minister announced Ireland's contribution to Kyoto and stated that, following consultation with his colleagues in Government and detailed negotiations in the EU Environment Council, he had agreed to limit the growth in greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels. He went on to state that this was a firm objective for Ireland which reflects our continuing need for sustainable economic growth and the necessity to make an ambitious but achievable contribution to the overall EU target.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that the Government would publish a greenhouse gas abatement strategy and set 31 July 1998 as the closing date for receipt of submissions. It then took him more than two years, until 2 November 2000, to produce the national climate change strategy, by which time he had to admit that the target of 13% which he had described as achievable two years earlier had now been exceeded eight years ahead of schedule. He said our real challenge is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20% in the next ten years. The strategy sets out how that reduction could be mathematically achieved, but in almost every sector the Minister has deferred any effective action until 2002 or later, by which stage he expects to be well gone from the Custom House.</P>
    <P>The first test of the strategy came in the budget when the Minister for Finance reduced the excise duty on motor fuels, presumably in response to the road hauliers protest. This was a humbling defeat for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who then went off in the dead of night to announce and inaccurately describe as green taxation an increase in motor registration tax which we will debate in the House on Thursday. This type of back down was nothing new for the Minister. Prior to the general election, he promised a moratorium on genetically modified organisms. However, he slithered out of that commitment by setting up a so-called consultation process which was so flawed that all 19 NGOs with an interest in the subject walked out and the Minister ended up in October 1999 announcing that Ireland would pursue a positive but precautionary national policy position on the release of GMOs and the environment based on scientific risk assessment and management. In other words, he now supports GMOs.</P>
    <P>Throughout his tenure in office the Minister has sought to portray himself as a reformer. We all remember the plans he had to reduce the Dáil <Col N="84" /> to 100 Members and to introduce single seat constituencies and a list system for elections. We should be grateful for the silver lining that he was too busy failing at everything else to do anything about that day dream.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also promised to reform local government. Local elections, which were due in 1996, were postponed until 1999 to allow the Minister to introduce the legislation. He had two years in office in which to do so but he failed to produce the legislation in time for the 1999 elections. The Bill was published last May, but it has still not been brought before the House. The only two so-called reforms which are in it, the direct election of mayors and the abolition of the dual mandate, are either being watered away or abandoned in the face of opposition from the Fianna Fáil Independents.</P>
      <P>In almost every area of his portfolio the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been a failure. The Labour Party has in this motion identified 15 failures. We could have added more, such as his failure to produce the ten Bills promised, queuing up on the legislative programme.</P>
      <P>One would expect a Minister in such serious trouble with his portfolio to have spent the past year trying to improve his performance. Instead he has concentrated on producing an Electoral Bill, ostensibly to reform the conduct of elections but in reality to increase Fianna Fáil's spend at the next election. As was published in a recent issue of <i>Magill,</i> he gave the direction to increase election spending limits. The decision to increase the amount of money Fianna Fáil can spend at the next election, coupled with his attempts to block the Labour Party Bill to ban corporate donations, makes one wonder who is in charge at the Custom House &ndash; Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or Deputy Dempsey, the treasurer of Fianna Fáil. Whichever persona is responsible, he has been a failure in his ministry &ndash; a failure to the house buyer, the tenant, the housing applicant, the commuter, the citizen and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion and our contributions to it are a political critique of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This is not a personal attack. The Labour Party does not deny the considerable political experience of the Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace, nor do we doubt their ability. We do not question their integrity or their commitment to their brief. However, we challenge their lamentable performance and we propose in this motion that they come back to this House within one month to account for their 15 failures and to tell us what they intend to do to put things right. There is something seriously wrong at the heart <Col N="85" /> of this Government when three high calibre Ministers with unprecedented money at their disposal cannot come to grips with the pressing national problems of housing, waste, environment and local services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time with me. The Green Party motion of no confidence and the Labour Party motion before the House this evening are a litany of failure. However, it is more than the failure of one Minister. It represents the collective failure of this discredited Government which lacks empathy with the people, the necessary talent and innovation to run a modern democracy and the vision of the type of society to which people aspire and which is now possible. It is a cynical, populist and narrowly political Government. By that I mean a Government which looks to the next election and not to the next generation. Nowhere is that better exemplified than in the performance of the ministerial incumbent in the Custom House, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
      <P>Collective responsibility will prevent him from blaming others in Government for his failure. However, even if it could, it could hardly explain his unprecedented record of under achievement. The reasons for this failure are fundamental. He has not been the Minister for the environment or for local government. How could he be? He is the treasurer of Fianna Fáil, the party of big business which wants power for itself at all costs and will not distribute that power. Fianna Fáil sees progress in terms of big business. Progress is measured in the number of cranes on the skyline and the number of cars on our streets and roads. However, the cranes are not building apartments or houses for those who need them or can afford them but for the speculators and the greedy landlords who generously contribute to Fianna Fáil coffers. Does this relationship with big business help to explain why the Government will not introduce legislation for security of tenure for tenants who face eviction on the whim of a landlord? Does it explain why the Minister will not introduce measures to combat spiralling house prices? Does it explain why he has not facilitated co-op housing or eco villages? It does. The Watergate maxim, &ldquo;follow the money&rdquo;, is relevant in this regard. If one follows the money, one will see the connections and discover the reasons for his lack of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adviser to George Bush senior once famously said that one can fool all the people all of the time if one's advertising budget is big enough. If the Minister has his way, the Fianna Fáil advertising budget will be big enough. Will it continue <Col N="86" /> to fool the people? It did at the last election. Expense was not spared for focus groups, policy developers, hype and glossy manifestos full of promises. Tonight we remember those promises, such as the promise of a moratorium on GMOs. However, we did not get a moratorium but a quango, an expensive Fianna Fáil committee to fudge the issue. We got excuses. The Minister said he was precluded by European legislation from banning GMOs, which was nonsense. The real reason was that the Americans and the giant multinationals, especially Monsanto, did not want such a ban introduced. Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, had a quiet word in the ear of the Taoiseach when he attended the White House.</P>
    <P>We also remember tonight the proposed tax on plastic bags. How many times have I raised this issue in the House? How many press releases and radio appearances have there been? How much spin has the Minister got from this issue? I was told before Christmas that separate legislation was not required. I was told it could be done by regulation or it could be included in the Finance Bill. We are now told that separate legislation is required and that it will be included in the new Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, which has appeared out of nowhere. What is all this foot dragging about? Is it that the plastics industry is not pleased about the prospect of a tax on plastic bags? Does the Taoiseach recoil at the idea of consumers paying a new tax close to an election? If the Minister wants to see the results of his lack of action on this issue, he should take a stroll in my constituency and look at the River Dodder which is polluted by plastic bags. He should look at the trees festooned with plastic bags. It is a repulsive sight. This is a reflection of the Minister's inadequacy and his legacy of failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised to tackle the problem of litter. He set up an anti-litter forum and its report was published, but nothing was done. Irish Business Against Litter has lost all faith in the Minister. Litter is the biggest turn off for tourists. Yet when the Minister is confronted with this problem he says if people did not throw litter, we would not have a litter problem. Dear me, that is deep analysis. The next thing the Minister will be saying is that if people did not heat their homes we would not have global warming, if they did not drive cars we would not have all these road accidents and if people did not insist on living in houses we would not have a housing problem. He says it is always other people's fault, but now we have a waste crisis and it is not the people's fault. The Minister has insisted on pursuing an exclusively pro-incineration line at the behest of industry, yet ordinary people all over the country have rejected that resoundingly. The democratically elected members of councils have rejected it and the Minister has told them that their decision does not matter. Deputy Molloy has never been the Minister for local government.</P>
    <P>The waste crisis is largely an industrial problem and it can only be solved if industry is made to <Col N="87" /> play its role. This will mean proper monitoring, insistence on the introduction of cleaner technology, producer responsibility and not letting them off the hook through Repak, which I hope the Minister now realises has not been a success. It will mean that the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle must apply not just to householders but also to industry.</P>
    <P>The last time the Minister was in the House at Question Time, he insisted that those who were opposed to incinerators were scare-mongering. He said that Ireland has low levels of dioxins, yet it has the highest level of cancer in Europe. This is absolutely true. If we increase dioxin levels through incineration we will have even more cancer, but the Minister is missing the point entirely. Why does Ireland have one of the highest cancer rates in Europe? Some 80% of cancers are environmentally linked, according to the World Health Organisation. It has to do with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink &ndash; the quality of our environment. Under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, our environment is going down the tubes. Reports have shown a marked decline in environmental quality. Our rivers and lakes are polluted, mostly from agricultural sources. Eutrophication is a major problem, according to the EPA's millennium report, yet the Minister does nothing. The air in our cities is polluted, mostly from car fumes. In Pearse Street, not far from here, the levels of PM10s, VOCs and nitrous oxides are alarming. Three times as many people are dying from car emissions as die from car accidents. Does the Minister care?</P>
    <P>The European Commission has more or less given up on the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his Department. He has shown nothing but contempt for EU environmental directives. All this comes about because of a failure to understand the concept of sustainability The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, claimed that his budget would improve people's quality of life. It did anything but that. It improved superficially their standard of living but under the Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the quality of life has actually decreased. In terms of sustainability, the Minister is bringing us back to the dark ages.</P>
    <P>The Green Party demands nothing less than the ecological modernisation of our country. That cannot be attained if the Minister and the Government are in power. For the sake of our people and the environment, the Government must go.</P>

      <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was appointed I knew that he would be a disaster as Minister with responsibility for housing. I knew that because before, when he was Minister with the same responsibilities, he was an unmitigated disaster. At that time, he had thousands of houses built around the country which are known as Molloy's botháns. They had <Col N="88" /> wooden walls, no foundations, flat roofs and no chimneys. The only council that refused to build them was Kerry County Council, and fair play to it for not doing so.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister with responsibility for housing I spent much of the available resources retrofitting Molloy's botháns to make them habitable. These houses started to fall asunder as soon as the builders left the site.

      <P>The most acute housing needs are faced by families waiting for council houses. Under this Administration, however, such families have been thrown to the tender mercies of private landlords, with no rent control and no enforcement of standards at the rag end of the rented market. When the Minister took office there were 26,000 families on the waiting list, there are now 60,000. Despite the Minister's target of building 25,000 houses in four years, less than 3,000 per year are being built. At the rate the Minister is providing houses, it will take 20 years to clear the backlog without any new families joining the waiting list. This situation is absolutely unacceptable. The Minister has allowed the housing list to go out of control without making the necessary provision. The Minister has loads of money. The leader of his party said the Government is awash with money, yet he has not made the necessary financial or management provisions to ensure the necessary houses are built. Even with the money the Minister provided, he did not ensure that local authorities had the ability to make proper use of it, so moneys were returned to his Department. The recently announced failure of the Minister's programme to set even the minimalist target he had set is a <Col N="89" /> serious indictment. Families in dire circumstances are waiting for what they are entitled to, a proper standard of housing.</P>
      <P>Most of us live in houses that we could not afford to buy now.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came to power the value, or price, of my modest house has trebled. If I wanted to buy the same house now I could not obtain a mortgage on my TD's salary. Children of white collar workers in my constituency have no hope of purchasing a house there. They are crucified by uncontrolled high rents demanded by the people who support the Minister, Deputy Molloy's, party and the party of his colleagues in Government. Many of them are forced on to the social housing list for sites, affordable housing schemes, the voluntary scheme or the council waiting list. They have swelled these lists. These are people who, previously, on moderate incomes, could afford to buy a house with a council loan. Operating my clinics, I have not assisted people in filling out a form for a council loan for three years because the council loans that are available would only constitute a deposit on houses in my area. I am not referring to fancy houses, I am talking about three-bedroom, terraced houses. The example of the two young teachers that my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, gave during his contribution tells the whole story. Two people earning £20,000 each now have to travel about 50 miles outside Dublin before they can afford a house.</P>
      <P>The homeless are at the end of this logjam that the Minister has created. Young and old people without hope are being forced to live on the streets because of the Minister's lack of action on housing.</P>

    <P>&ndash;measures to meaningfully address, for the first time ever, the vexed issue of unfinished estates,</P>
    <P>&ndash;the increased staffing resources being made available for local authority planning departments and An Bord Pleanála; and,</P>
    <P>in relation to the National Spatial Strategy </P>
    <P>&ndash;the fact that the national spatial strategy will be completed on time, by the end of 2001, and notes the extensive consultation and participation arrangements related to the development of the strategy which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has put in place.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to open the Government's response to the motion. The rank hypocrisy implied by it is very hard to take. It implies that the new red and green axis was the prime mover in the infrastructural, economic and social development of the country. In reality, it is most likely to hold up, in every way possible, badly needed local authority housing, key roads and water services projects, planning permissions for major housing developments and so on. The list is practically endless.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, from the motion in its name, that the Labour Party had bequeathed to the Government an idyllic situation. The implication is that our infrastructure was fully geared to meet the needs of a modern economy; that there was an orderly housing market with supply and demand finely balanced; that our levels of environmental protection were the envy of the modern world and that no foreseeable difficulty had emerged in relation to waste management.</P>
    <P>We all know, including those behind the motion, that the truth is different. It was left to the Government to take action to increase invest<Col N="94" /> ment in infrastructure right across the board. The unparalleled levels of funding available under the national development plan are redressing our infrastructural deficit as rapidly as capacity constraints in the construction industry allow. The housing market is coming back into balance thanks to the measures taken by the Government. Our record on environmental protection includes action on waste management and climate change to mention but two of the many effective and progressive initiatives taken since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Government has not failed to deliver on any of its commitments. The Labour Party, however, knows about failure, having &ldquo;been there, but not done that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In today's newspaper it is reported that a Green Party councillor is strongly critical of Dublin Corporation's housing strategy because it involves zoning additional land. Criticism of the Government on the issue of house prices and meeting social housing need is heavily ironic from a party whose approach to the provision of housing and infrastructure, so obviously needed by our growing population, is to &ldquo;build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government has never shirked its responsibilities in relation to housing. Whereas the previous rainbow Government had scarcely lifted a finger, despite the ominous trends already established, we immediately set about tackling the issue. From day one we put in place a comprehensive range of measures to maximise and expedite housing supply, to secure house price moderation and to meet the increased need for social and affordable housing. Those measures have yielded positive results and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Last year we again saw record housing output with almost 50,000 new houses being constructed. In spite of continuing high demand and lower interest rates, the effects of this increased output are being reflected in moderating house price trends. The most recent house price figures available provide strong evidence of a moderation in the rate of house price increase, particularly new house prices, with annual increases in the 10% to 14% range, compared to a peak of 42% in early 1998. It is widely accepted that the Government's actions have been a critical factor in achieving house price moderation. There is also firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market in particular.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the increasing level of social housing need, which our colleagues opposite took no effective action to allay when they had the opportunity to do so, the Government responded by introducing, for the first time, multi-annual programming for the local authority and voluntary housing programmes instead of the old year-on year-off system. We have increased funding for housing programmes threefold over what was provided in 1997 by the previous Government. <Col N="95" /> This clearly reflects the priority we afford to meeting social housing needs.</P>
    <P>Increased funding is only part of the equation. In 1997 the number of local authority housing starts was 3,500. It has now been virtually doubled with latitude to front load programmes as much as possible. The multi-annual approach adopted by the Government will allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the 41,500 additional local authority houses to be started under the national development plan. The four year programme of 25,000 starts, is pitched at the maximum level that can be delivered.</P>
    <P>One of the problems I have encountered in expanding the local authority housing programme is the degree of local opposition to individual schemes. That opposition is often orchestrated by members of the parties which have put their names to the motion. It is ironic to hear the Labour Party and the Green Party being concerned about meeting social housing need. I can find no evidence of a strong push from Labour Party councillors for more local authority housing in their areas. I challenge them on that issue. The absence of support where it is most needed, at local level, only serves to show the hypocrisy of the motion.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt that the Government is fully committed to tackling the problem of homelessness. We have launched an integrated strategy to ensure a comprehensive response from all the statutory and voluntary agencies providing services for the homeless. I am confident that the direct involvement of local authorities and health boards in a more collaborative manner will strengthen the overall response to homelessness and secure the appropriate solutions which voluntary bodies have identified as not being made or being deficient. The action plan for the Dublin area has been completed and adopted. The measures in the plan are being rolled out, with specific targets to ensure the level of homelessness in Dublin is reduced.</P>
    <P>Substantial current and capital funding has been made available to local authorities to ensure the accommodation measures in the strategy are implemented. Additional funding will also be available from health boards to fund the necessary care and welfare services. I am well aware of the importance of the private rented sector and its potential in meeting our housing needs. Actions taken by the Government include specific incentives for the provision of rented accommodation in urban renewal areas, as well as for students. We have doubled the income tax relief in respect of rent paid by tenants and introduced a new &ldquo;rent a room&rdquo; scheme to encourage home owners to provide additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>In 1999, I took the initiative to establish a commission on the private rented residential sector in order to address the issues of security of tenure, dispute resolution mechanisms, the regulatory regime for the sector and how best to secure <Col N="96" /> increased supply of accommodation. I announced proposals for major reforms in the sector on 5 January last following careful consideration of the recommendations of the commission. It is disingenuous of the Deputies opposite to suggest that legislation on landlord and tenant issues can be introduced out of a hat. As anyone familiar with the subject will know, landlord and tenant issues are subject to a highly complex and integrated legislative code which falls within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In collaboration with that Department, we are committed to completing this legislative programme as quickly as possible and the necessary staffing resources have been committed.</P>
    <P>The Government has rightly proceeded with implementation of measures to boost the supply of private rented accommodation which will be of considerable benefit to existing and prospective tenants. The motion tabled by the Labour and Green Parties implies that we should have delayed the introduction of these initiatives. I see no merit in that approach given the extent of housing need.</P>
    <P>By next autumn we will establish a private residential tenancies board on a non-statutory basis. This board will primarily deal with disputes between landlords and tenants and will also provide a research, advice and information service in this important sector.</P>
    <P>The priority afforded by the Government to the housing area and the direction and force of Government policies are widely acknowledged as correct. We will continue to give priority to ensuring higher housing output to meet the needs of our growing population and particularly the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society.</P>
    <P>In the matter of road safety, this is the first Government to prepare and adopt a national road safety strategy. The Government has led the heightened political priority now being given to road safety. We have set quantified and clearly stated objectives and deliberately made ourselves more accountable than any previous Government for progressing the road safety agenda. The strategy sets, as its primary target, the reduction of road fatalities by a minimum of 20% by the year 2000, relative to 1997, with a similar reduction in serious injuries. The annual toll of road deaths has been reduced by over 12% in 1999 and again last year. When the proponents of the motion were in government there was no national strategy to reduce road fatalities, which were rising rather than being reduced. The interim target of the strategy regarding road deaths was to reduce Ireland's rate of road fatalities below 116 per million population. We have already exceeded this target. Nevertheless, there is no acceptable level of road fatalities. We must continue to strive for reduced fatalities and fewer serious injuries on our roads.</P>
    <P>The computer systems needed to support a national driver file, with penalty points functionality, will be in place this year. I intend that <Col N="97" /> the legislation dealing with this matter will be published shortly and that it will be processed urgently by the Oireachtas to tie in with the new IT system.</P>
    <P>Our road safety strategy is ambitious and hard-edged and it has set demanding and quantified targets for achievement within its five year period. We have sponsored this strategy and we have made ourselves more accountable to progress on road safety activities than any of our predecessors. Accordingly, we have made greater progress.</P>
    <P>For these and many other reasons which, because of the time available, I am not able to adduce, I am happy to commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. I also welcome the Government's investment in water and sewerage schemes, particularly those in County Galway. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has shown his support, in a practical way, by the provision of water from the Corrib to supply Tuam regional water project, which not only supplies the town of Tuam and its environs but extends towards Galway through towns such as Athenry, Oranmore, Headford, Milltown and areas on the county boundary with Mayo. The Minister has also supported the idea of low cost sewerage schemes, based on a reed bed treatment system and this has reduced the cost of these schemes and given us good value for money. It has also led to additional housing construction and other developments. I pay tribute to the work done by the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace, in respect of those programmes.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council, in particular, has benefited from these developments. The council has a four year housing programme up to 2003 under which 568 local authority houses are to be built. It also has plans for the building of 364 voluntary houses and 245 affordable houses in the same period. There are also 50 improvement works in lieu planned in house extensions.</P>
      <P>There is no reference in the Labour Party's motion to water schemes or group water schemes. That is not surprising because, when he was Minister, Deputy Howlin abolished domestic water charges but, initially, he made no reference to group water schemes. A vacuum was created which was filled by the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, which highlighted the discrimination against rural areas. The Labour motion refers to 15 failures on the part of the Minister. To continue to alliteration, there were, perhaps, 100 howlers when Deputy Howlin was Minister dealing with group water schemes alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a situation where funding and proper support structures for group schemes have been put in place. Grants have been increased from £1,600 and £1,200 for houses and farms to £5,100 per house to upgrade the schemes. Indeed, there is 10% extra on offer in Gaeltacht areas and <Col N="98" /> there are 100% grant aid packages where there is no public water supply. We are now extending town supplies to rural areas by way of regional schemes. A good example of this is the Ballinasloe regional water scheme. However, people do not realise that it costs householders at least £1,000 to join a water scheme in rural areas. Many group schemes will not be able to continue if costs increase. I inquired recently about an extension of water supplies from Ballinasloe to Aughrim and the Department informed me that the cost for this is now £12,133 per house. In my opinion, funding should be provided to extend regional schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to obtain European Regional Development Fund moneys from the EU for these schemes, particularly in light of his past success in obtaining European funding for many schemes throughout the country in the past. If funding is available from any other source in the EU, for example, through FEOGA, we should also try to obtain it because it is important to the agriculture and food industries.</P>
    <P>The Government has had considerable success in bringing price moderation back into the housing market. We are now well positioned to make even further progress in the months ahead thanks to the social and affordable housing provisions in the Planning and Development Act. On this side of the House we have had to listen to all sorts of comments from the Opposition in respect of house prices. However, talk is cheap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is cheaper than buying a house, in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Action requires courage and there has been no shortage of that from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who introduced the radical provisions whereby local authorities can acquire, at existing use prices, up to 20% of residential land for social and affordable housing. This is a clear example of the Government's commitment to action and of the Minister's ability to take brave decisions. Contrary to Opposition suggestions, the staffing resources in local authority planning departments have increased dramatically in recent years. In the period September 1999 to January 2001, the numbers of staff rose from 895 to 1,090.</P>
      <P>Another first for the Government and the Minister is the preparation of the national spatial strategy, which represents the first concerted effort by any Government to give effect to the concept of balanced regional development. As a Deputy representing a constituency in the west with first-hand knowledge of the effects of unbalanced regional development, I look forward to this strategy spreading the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy more evenly. The Government has set down a two year period for the completion of the strategy and the vast amount of work the Minister has done so far ensures that he will meet his target date at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> The Labour Party in particular seems to believe that any half-baked set of ideas can be thrown together between two covers and called a spatial strategy. Its spatial planning document, which was published quite recently, is best remembered because of the unusual suggestion it contains for the banning of developments within one mile of the coastline. The Government is developing a comprehensive strategy which will fulfil its purpose and withstand the test of time. I have no doubt that the Minister will deliver this on time at the end of the year. I compliment him on his record of achievement to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, set out a progressive programme for the Government's term of office. The Government's record of delivering on the commitments in that programme and in the revised version from 1999 is second to none. Its performance will reach even greater heights during the next 15 months when the delivery on our commitments will be completed to an extent that has never been achieved by any previous Administration.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and his Ministers of State have been working tirelessly to a radical and reforming agenda. Their achievements are evident across the wide spectrum of issues which come within the ambit of their Department. It is obvious, particularly to public representatives, that no area within the Department has escaped the Minister and his Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>I understand that of the 145 items of legislation enacted from June 1997 to the end of the year 2000, 15 were sponsored by the Minister. There are at least two Bills sponsored by him before the Oireachtas at present and work is advancing rapidly on a number of other Bills dealing with areas as diverse as waste, housing, water services and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>In the time available I wish to concentrate on the area of local government. Before doing so, I must state that the Opposition motion displays a frightening level of innocence by suggesting that local government reform is predicated on the Local Government Bill alone. The Bill underpins a massive programme of reform which is already under way and bearing fruit. The Minister believes in local government. That is evident from the ambitious programme for local government reform set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and has been even more visible in the extent to which the Minister has delivered on that agenda. Implementation of any major reform programme, let alone one as ambitious as that pursued by the Government, is never without its difficulties. However, by remaining steadfastly committed to the principle of ensuring that local government regains its rightful place at the heart of local communities, the Minister has shown great initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> Given the state of near collapse in the local government system, which became so pronounced under the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government, short-term life support would have been useless. What was needed was radical reconstructive surgery and this has been provided under the Minister's leadership. For the first time ever, widespread consultation was undertaken by the Minister with councillors throughout the country. Most importantly, the Government acknowledged from the outset that the reform programme would be superficial unless the system of local government funding was radically overhauled.</P>
    <P>The funding issue, therefore, became the Minister's first priority. Before the end of 1997 he had finalised plans for a new local government fund which came into operation in 1999. The Minister's new funding arrangements are now delivering massively increased resources to the local government system for discretionary spending. The allocation to the fund for local authorities this year is well over 60%, up on the equivalent amounts provided by the Labour Party's Minister for the Environment in 1997. Crucially, in terms of the future financing base of local authorities, the legislation setting up the fund ring fences it exclusively for local government purposes. Deputy Kitt properly outlined the major progress made in the rural water programme. The announcement today by the Minister of State of funding for local improvement schemes shows that particular funding has been increased by 167% over a four year period.</P>
    <P>I know public servants working in local authorities who openly state that it is a great time to work in local government with the very substantial funding provided by the Minister and with the new additional powers being devolved to local authorities. With additional resources being provided to the local authority system, the Minister has recognised the importance of ensuring efficiency, value for money and customer service.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the new financial management system for local authorities which has been developed. The structures of the local government system have also been reformed by the Minister. Strategic policy committees are now up and running with the elected members working with sectoral interests. These new arrangements are being supported by a package of measures including a proper training programme for elected members and the introduction of new directors of service.</P>
    <P>An important measure introduced by the Minister was his promotion in 1999 of a referendum to give constitutional recognition to local government. Following an overwhelming vote in favour of the amendment, our Constitution now provides for such recognition in line with most other European constitutions. It also guarantees that the interval between local elections is constitutionally guaranteed, thus ending a practice of <Col N="101" /> postponement of local elections which in the past tended to devalue the local government system.</P>

      <P>If there was a prize available for Members of this House who excel in great works of fiction, the clear winners would be the Deputies from the Labour Party and the Green Party who have put their names to the motion before the House tonight. This House is not about fiction. It is about fact, reality and home truths and it is about time a few home truths about the Labour Party and the Green Party entered into this debate.</P>
      <P>Where better to start than environmental issues, where there are home truths aplenty. Let us first take the issue of legal actions by the European Union. One of the areas where the Commission has initiated legal proceedings against Ireland is in relation to water quality. The Labour Party Deputies may have short memories but let me remind them that their spell in Government left nothing but a legacy of open warfare with the group water scheme sector. The Labour Party spent its time in Government arguing with the Commission as to whether the relevant directive applied to privately sourced group schemes. It completely missed the point that whether the directive did or did not apply, a serious water quality problem existed which needed to be tackled.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party and the Green Party failed to even recognise the problem, never mind tackle it. It fell to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to pick up the pieces on this issue. He quickly entered into a constructive process of dialogue with the group water scheme sector and it has been working in close partnership with the Government for more than three years, as Deputy Kitt outlined. In addition, the Minister has secured a massive increase in funding for the rural water programme and is implementing a range of initiatives to ensure that water quality issues are fully addressed by the end of 2003. If Ireland is dragged through the European Court of Justice on this issue, the Labour Party should bow its head in shame.</P>
      <P>We should get real on the issue of waste, which also features in the Opposition motion. When the rainbow Government left office, there was not even a hint of a national policy on waste management. We were destined to continue with our environmentally disastrous practice of almost exclusively burying our waste in holes in the ground. It fell to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, once again to respond to this challenge and once again he came up trumps with a comprehensive policy document, Changing our Ways, published in 1998. He also recognised that difficulties with a number of local authorities finalising their waste management plans cannot be allowed to hold up progress on this issue, and he will shortly announce details of his proposals to bring this planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> I notice a reference in the Opposition motion to chaos in relation to refuse charges. The only place where there is chaos on this issue is within the Labour Party whose members speak out of both sides of their mouths. On the one hand they say they subscribe to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle while on the other they find all sorts of spurious reasons for not supporting it in practice.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; might also be better associated with the Green Party's approach to waste management. While its ten point plan plagiarises many proposals from the Government's policy document, it sees no role for energy recovery in dealing with our waste. For a long time the Greens have been pressed by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to come clean and outline how they propose to deal with residual waste. They have consistently dodged the issue, preferring instead to subscribe to what the Minister has described as the Paul Daniels school of waste management, where the waste conveniently disappears. However, in its ten point plan the Green Party finally had to come clean. What is its solution? It will store residual waste. Anyone who knows anything about waste management knows this is probably the most environmentally unsustainable policy position, reflecting the usual inability of the Green Party to face up to difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>In terms of our infrastructure, it would be laughable if it was not so serious to see the Green Party and the Labour Party condemning the Government in relation to the delivery on a wide range of infrastructural projects. In my experience, and I have no doubt it is not confined to Dublin, proposals for housing, roads and water and sewerage facilities are regularly opposed by the &ldquo;build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything&rdquo; lobby. As the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said, the Green Party or the Labour Party will always be actively involved in leading these campaigns. It is bad enough that they put so much time into negative campaigning and knocking, but what is sickening is the inconsistency they show in this House by slamming the pace of progress in addressing our infrastructural deficits.</P>
    <P>Despite the negativity of the Opposition, the parties in Government will continue to press ahead with building a better Ireland for all our people. The national development plan, which we published just over a year ago, provides the framework for achieving that. In many respects the plan is without precedent. First, it has broken new ground in terms of the strategic vision it sets, guided by the objective of achieving balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>The breadth of the plan is entirely new. In the area of economic infrastructure, for which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is primarily responsible, the plan addresses our infrastructural deficits in an integrated way. Roads, both national and non-national, housing for the first time ever, public transport, waste-water services and health infrastructure all feature strongly in the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I am proud of Deputy Dempsey's achievements which are succinctly summed up in the Government's amendment to the motion. On that basis, I am delighted to support the Government amendment and to have had the opportunity to speak in support of it this evening.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear that because I was looking forward to being grateful to the Labour Party and the Green Party for affording us the opportunity to outline the wonderful improvements in infrastructural areas that have been attained under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. Deputy Kitt referred to many of those in the area of water and sewerage and in County Clare we have benefited under this Government as we never have previously.</P>
      <P>There is also a massive commitment to the national road network where there was a serious lack of planning during the previous two years which delayed the implementation of many of the projects. There has been a massive increase in resources for local and regional roads. Even in the recent bad weather we saw a first class response from local authorities to something that would have ground the State virtually to a halt in previous years.</P>
      <P>There is only one effective means to address high house prices, that is, to dramatically increase output. Under this Government we have the highest level <i>per capita</i> of housing output in the European Union. It is vitally important that this level of output be sustained for the foreseeable future. The Minister should continue on his present course and avoid the daft proposals which come from some of the Opposition parties. He should bear in mind their failures to address this problem when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>There has been a trebling of resources allocated to housing since this Government took office to £1.1 billion in 2001. The Planning and Development Act, which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, enacted, has stood the Supreme Court tests of its constitutionality, which many people said it would not. Nobody ever pretended that it would have an immediate effect on the housing market but it will have enormous long-term benefits and future Governments and populations will benefit from its effects. I also pay tribute to the Minister for having addressed the vexed question of unfinished estates in that legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of the economy undoubtedly has placed enormous pressures on local government and on our environment generally the growth in the economy, population, increased mobility, changing work practices and changing production <Col N="104" /> practices. The population from the youngest to the oldest has also experienced these pressures but has responded well to the demands. People are more conscious of the environment. They work harder and longer. Women in their thousands have returned, against all the odds, to or remained in work and emigrants have returned to help the Celtic tiger. People have changed work practices. The service industry, construction, manufacturing, tourism have dramatically increased their output in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is huge public frustration emerging at the Minister's failure to respond accordingly, to put in place the infrastructure &ndash; and I mean that in its widest sense &ndash; the services and facilities urgently required to meet the needs of families, communities, businesses and society generally. He fails to give the guidance and leadership to ensure that the pattern of growth and change is enriching, sustainable and civilised for future generations as well. On the Minister's watch, all the constraints, bottlenecks and barriers to growth are concentrated in his Department, holding up and putting at risk his own work and everyone else's. The infrastructural deficit has grown to massive proportions with housing, planning and traffic gridlock at crisis point. A massive waste management catastrophe is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about the growing waiting lists for social housing which, despite the Minister's figures, are growing. Can the Minister explain why this is happening when for the first time in my memory we have full employment? Well paid couples who in other times would expect to buy a house have no hope of buying one. They join that unknown and unknowable list of people seeking affordable housing. Not one such house has been provided but it gives them hope that at some time they might get one. The serviced land initiative which was to solve our problems is inadequate. It is timid and does not provide the investment to meet the needs in a reasonable time scale. Despite the Bacon reports, the changes and the talk about housing, the Minister fails to identify the single underlying cause &ndash; supply.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's first moves was against the rental sector. It was intended to be a move against profiteering but it decimated the sector. Supply in that sector decreased. He discouraged anyone from going into that business and created a cartel of those already there availing of existing tax benefits. Rents are going sky high. The people at the bottom of the rung, the poor, the homeless, the elderly, people with no hope of getting on housing lists are suffering most.</P>
    <P>Starts are down no matter what the Minister claims. There is evidence, and not just anecdotal, that land hoarding is increasing, not decreasing. The Minister introduced a welter of subsidies, grants, incentives and disincentives. He changed them. He has been back and forth to the point where everyone in the market realises that he does not know what he is doing. He is not tackling the fundamental problem. He has introduced <Col N="105" /> uncertainty. Builders are leaving land that might have been used for housing or they are changing it to commercial use. They are leaving to build in London, Bradford and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is a result of not understanding that the basic problem is supply which is land based. Land inflation means house price inflation. Until land inflation is dealt with the housing problem will not be solved. If the Minister signals he will deal with the land problem, certainty may be introduced into the market. The only measure the Government brought in which might have increased the land supply was the threat of a penal capital gains tax. A few months after it was introduced, it was removed. What was behind that? Whose interests were served? It was not in the interests of the homeless, those on social housing lists or those trying to buy a home. What signal did that send to the market &ndash; that we have enough land?</P>
    <P>While the national development plan is proceeding and money is being spent across the country, we have no spatial plan. This is inextricably linked to the housing problem. Houses are built in the wrong place, in an <i>ad hoc</i> unplanned fashion. Unfortunate Dublin couples buy houses in Mullingar or Carlow, condemning themselves to a life of commuting. This does no good to the towns and even less good to the environment because of commuting. This is also damaging Dublin communities. In a private enterprise economy, spatial plans can only direct investment. Time is of the essence. We are at the top of the economic cycle, even on the downward side, and, unless we catch that tide of investment and expansion, the national spatial plan will remain aspirational with catastrophic consequences for the environment and sustainable development, to which the Minister pays lip service.</P>
    <P>I was there when the Minister announced the plan in Malahide but he is at odds with local authorities. The hinterland guidelines are unclear, requiring leadership from him. I do not understand what principle underlies them, what is being directed. Why is development directed to towns within commuting distance of Dublin but outside the green belt? To what principle are they conforming? The Minister must explain this. A letter requesting them to explain why it is in line with the strategic guidelines is not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be tired of hearing that house prices and rents doubled during his time in office. Last week I raised the issue of 9% stamp duty on investor homes with the Minister for Finance. Supply is the kernel of the problem. I believe that the Minister for Finance, judging by his body language &ndash; because he is curtailed by Cabinet confidentiality &ndash; was against the measure. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government supported it. The Government is correct to do a U-turn. I point out to colleagues in the Labour Party that Fine Gael was the only party who disagreed with this <Col N="106" /> approach and we are proved right. It had a negative impact on supply.</P>
      <P>I support integrated housing but the 20% public housing requirement, part of the Planning and Development Bill, is unworkable. The Minister is very ambitious. He tried to replicate what de Valera did in the 1940s and 1950s, or what Parnell did at the turn of the century. He is trying to leave a legacy by putting his own style on housing, but I do not think it can work. Those of us lucky enough to be here in a few years will have to change this plan. When housing strategies are drawn up, we will see the shortcomings in it. Deputy Killeen mentioned the planning and development Bill, but regrettably large sections of it have yet to be commenced.</P>
      <P>The national development plan proposes to develop the road between Blessington and Tallaght. I put down a question on this, only to be told that it is the responsibility of the NRA. Has the Government responsibility for this element of the national plan? The dual mandate aspect of the local government Bill is causing a lot of difficulty, but upon examination there is very little in it. Councillors will be given more remuneration but no power, which they must be given if we are serious about local government.</P>
      <P>Political funding is a topical issue, but many of us are missing an aspect of it which follows on from the evidence of former Deputy Ray Burke at the Flood tribunal. I refer to political spending between elections. He seems to have spent an inordinate amount, although I am not the judge of that. People who can gather and spend large amounts of money between elections, perhaps by buying drinks or sponsoring golf outings, are surely given an unfair advantage. We need to put a limit on contributions, on the amount that can be spent at election time and on how we conduct ourselves between elections. If I had £50,000 to spend between elections, I would be well able to feather my nest, so to speak. It gives an unfair advantage in the democratic process. The Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues, should address this problem.</P>

      <P>As regards waste management, surely the Minister will accept that there is a crisis. In county Clare, there is a proposal to use a landfill site in Muingnaminane, County Kerry, as a solution to their looming crisis. Local residents in that area are blockading the dump and not allowing Kerry County Council to take their <Col N="107" /> waste, as a protest against the proposal. Unless the Minister adopts a hands on approach, there will be a crisis in Clare. The reaction of county councillors from all parties in Kerry shows they will not allow Clare to use the Muingnaminane site.</P>
      <P>I remember when we were trying to identify a site for a dump in Kerry, we visited about ten sites and there was a protest at each one. Eventually, we stuck out our necks and decided on a site, which was difficult for those of us who had friends living close to it. We thought we were selecting a site for life, but if we allow Clare County Council to use it we will shorten the lifespan of it and have the same problem in a few years time, as Clare will not have its own site for three years. There will be a major problem, and the Minister should contact Clare County Council immediately to look for a solution. The Doora dump in County Clare has been given an extension to be used until July, but I am sure extra waste can be put there beyond that date. There may be other solutions, but the Minister has to act.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the issue of EU directives on the environment. We are developing a bad reputation in Europe as regards environmental protection. Many Europeans come here on holidays or on Commission business, and those who take trips around the country can see the destruction that is taking place. The Minister must act.</P>

      <P>I was in the Nuremore Hotel and was impressed when the Minister said he was increasing the money for county roads by 21%. However, Monaghan only received 15%, Cavan <Col N="108" /> 13%, Meath 55% and Kildare 110%. Although there are all sorts of explanations, the poor condition of the roads of Monaghan makes it difficult to tell people they are receiving fair play. Although there has been a sizeable increase in the amount being paid, costs have increased, as has the demand for better road structures. The Minister's engineers are rightly demanding extra funding. Without making a political issue of this, I beg the Minister to ensure the needs of the people of rural Ireland are looked after. There is an unfair 15-year waiting list for county and tertiary roads.</P>
      <P>The regional road from Cootehill to Monaghan, which passes through Newbliss, has not received any money. The road from Ballybay to Scots Corner, which serves the Monaghan county dump, is impassable, and has not received a shilling. When looking through the books, given that there is money not utilised elsewhere, the Minister should keep this in mind.</P>
      <P>There is only one artery road in Monaghan for people to transfer goods to market, or to go to and from major hospitals, and that is the M2 motorway. Not one sod has been turned in County Monaghan as far as bypasses are concerned. Many people will have had bypasses on their hearts before anything happens. The grandchild of a County Monaghan family lost his life on another section of that road through Slane, and we cannot continue to ignore the bridge there. It is difficult, but we have to decide which is more important, funds or people's lives. Many lives have been lost on that bridge and on that road, partly because delays going through towns means that people speed. The Belfast to Galway route goes through Monaghan town and Clones. It is truly a cross-Border route, and I urge that it be considered. With all the talk about money in the country, for whatever reason only 30 houses were built in Monaghan town in the past two years. The Minister is not totally to blame, but I urge him, by whatever means possible, to make sure that a town the size of Monaghan receives better treatment. I want to emphasise&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have five minutes, which is obviously inadequate to do any form of justice to a debate on our health services. I have some awareness of the difficulties faced by a Minister for Health and Children. It is a difficult ministry. No Minister in Hawkins House, however, has ever had the resources that the current incumbent has had. While the Minister for Health and Children came full of promise, he has been woefully lacking when it comes to delivering. It seems that the Labour Party will once again have to pick up the pieces of a shattered health service left in the hands of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration.</P>
      <P>There is much I could say, but I want to focus on the situation in Wexford General Hospital which is, in many ways, a microcosm of smaller general hospitals throughout the country. I expect that when the Minister is responding to the debate, the points which have general application will be responded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accident and emergency service is stretched in Wexford General Hospital. The Minister has sanctioned four additional consultants for the south east. It is my understanding that all of them are to go to Waterford Regional Hospital. If that is to be the case, there will be no proper supervision for NCHDs in accident and emergency. They will be unwilling to present themselves to work in a hospital like the one in Wexford, and the accident and emergency service will be threatened. The same will happen in obstetrics and gynaecology. The Institute of Obstetricians has demanded that there be at least three consultants before it will recognise training courses. There are only two in Wexford and hospitals like it. The future of gynaecology and maternity services in regional hospitals of the scale of Wexford is under threat. We have a new CAT scan in Wexford General Hospital, provided by the good will of the people of the town and county of Wexford. It is running at anything, but its full capacity because of the lack of resources and personnel. I could deal in some detail with the paediatrics department. It is also under threat because there are not sufficient consultants sanctioned to provide 24-hour, 365-day <Col N="111" /> cover. Training is jeopardised as a result. Anaesthesia and geriatrics face exactly the same difficulty. The most glaring difficulty of all is that planned capital development of Wexford General Hospital has been long-fingered year on year in the past four years. The capacity of the medical department of Wexford General Hospital has been running at something like 130%, squeezing out surgical beds, and planned surgical operations have been deferred because of the pressure of numbers. What we need more than anything else is additional beds. The numbers we have are hopelessly inadequate. Patients wait months on end for outpatient visits because there are insufficient consulting rooms.</P>
    <P>What is at stake &ndash; I hope the Minister of State will pass this on to his senior colleague &ndash; is the future of smaller hospitals like Wexford General Hospital. The Minister must be clear and unambiguous in his reply that he will resource the smaller hospitals in the regions. Otherwise we will be reduced, in a very short time, to a number of very large regional hospitals, an hour, an hour and a half or two hours away from some centres of population. This is wrong, inadequate, and part of the deficiencies for which the Minister is responsible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of overcrowding and waiting lists in hospitals. Is there a plan to co-ordinate all available beds within health board areas, for example, the south western health board in my area or the Eastern Regional Health Authority? What linkages are there between hospital management and health boards? In this era of high-tech, can a plan not be put in place to co-ordinate the workings of all hospitals within the remit of the Department? Would it not be feasible for bed managers of each hospital to collate the spaces available within the system in order that at any one time a general practitioner could, by use of a computer link-up, find out the number of available bed spaces within the system and the hospitals where such vacancies arise? </P>
      <P>My general practitioner contacted me in relation to an experience he had recently. He telephoned the casualty department in Tallaght General Hospital, the flagship of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. He was informed that there were 27 patients on trolleys. What is worse is that he was informed that he could send a patient, but only if the ambulance waited outside the door to take the patient home after examination. This can only be described as an absolute and total disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems in relation to this matter is that in many cases beds are taken up by geriatric patients who have no place else to go. St. Vincent's Hospital and Naas General Hospital are both packed, and there is no possibility of anything being done about it. We are in the process of spending a major sum of money on <Col N="112" /> developing Naas Hospital, but it will be of no use to the medical system in County Kildare and its hinterland if something is not done about collating the hospital services with nursing homes and the geriatric hospital in Athy to ensure the maximum number of beds are available in Naas to allow for the use of those hospitals' accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>Time and again I am asked by constituents what the health board is doing about the fact that their relatives have had to spend 48 hours on a trolley or a chair in Naas Hospital. When the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; seems to be the biggest thing we have, how do we expect the next generation to treat us when they see how we are treating the present generation of senior citizens? What we are doing to senior citizens is an absolute disgrace and totally unacceptable. One has to wonder when a person of 82 years of age is left on a trolley in Naas General Hospital for 72 hours not knowing whether she will get a bed and what will happen to her because she has no one at home to care for her. That is the health system we have and it is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>It is time we faced up to the reality that we will be the old people of tomorrow and that if the system is not improved we will have no place to go. If we do not show respect for older people then the younger generation will have no respect for us.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that geriatric units are being treated in this fashion. No one can stand up in the House tonight and say that they are being treated in a proper and correct manner. The staff in these hospitals who work day and night to give some comfort to pensioners are to be complimented. It is time for the Minister to take action and give hospitals some hope for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Roche and Dennehy.</P>
      <P>Over the years successive Governments and Ministers have failed to adequately respond to the needs of the health service. As a result of such failures, we have serious and challenging tasks. I acknowledge the commitment and determination of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, in addressing these tasks. I wish to focus on the eastern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to develop first class services <Col N="113" /> based on assessment of need for the people of the region and to ensure an equitable and co-ordinated delivery of service by the statutory and voluntary agencies working more closely together under the umbrella of the ERHA and, more importantly, being funded by the ERHA on the basis of service providers' capacity to deliver services. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, asked the ERHA to provide leadership, interrogate the reasons for apparent chronic problems and not to accept the usual answers.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear some of the comments made by Deputies, particularly Labour Party Deputies who not too long ago were charged with responsibility for the delivery of service but failed. I accept that there are problems in the service, but we must remember that each year hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern region receive first class treatment in hospitals both as in-patients and out-patients. There are difficulties, but these are experienced by a minority. We are working to put in place initiatives to minimise these difficulties and to tackle them in an ordered and measured fashion.</P>
    <P>It is important to put the following points on the record. Last year waiting lists for hospital admissions in the eastern region decreased by an average of 3% per quarter while waiting lists for open heart surgery were reduced by 25%. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has put in place a number of imaginative initiatives to further reduce these waiting lists. We are buying capacity where it exists in public and private hospitals to enable people on waiting lists to have their procedures carried out quickly. We have made arrangements for children in Crumlin Hospital waiting for heart surgery to have their operations carried out abroad, pending the completion of additional theatres in Crumlin Hospital.</P>
    <P>The eastern region's population is 1.3 million, 35.7% of the national figure. Population growth in the eastern region accounts for 55.4% of national growth. We have done extraordinarily well given those figures and the fact that people from outside the region regularly avail of services within the region. Unfortunately this distorts the picture, but in light of my comments I think Members will appreciate that we are doing a good job. I pay tribute to my fellow board members on the Eastern Regional Health Authority who have done a tremendous job and showed great commitment over the past number of years. I also thank the chief executive officer, Donal O'Shea, and his management team.</P>
    <P>The work carried out by the ERHA includes an assessment of the bed capacity required to treat not only people in the east but also those from other areas who come to Dublin for treatment. It is estimated that at any one time 20% of people in hospitals in Dublin come from outside the region. This causes difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment has shown that we need an additional 1,270 beds to cater for our needs. Progress is being made in the Department in this regard.</P>
      <P>The review has shown that hospital activity in the eastern region has become more efficient, is accommodating an increased population above national growth and has greater activity, with significant fewer beds in real terms by national and international ratios. Practice has substantially altered with a reduced length of stay and a high proportion of day cases. The development of 1,276 additional beds will allow the authority to examine in a fundamental way how services should be planned and developed over the next decade.</P>
      <P>The authority intends to approach this issue in two ways. Plans to provide immediate additional capacity in medical, surgical and dedicated day elective facilities are being finalised. I believe we will have good news in this regard by the end of the year. The authority will also undertake a medium term planning exercise on how to provide the additional places by examining such issues as how major accidents should be dealt with within the eastern region, how hospitals should co-operate in the provision of A&amp;E services, how day surgery and ambulatory care should be organised to provide efficient use of facilities and manpower in a local area and regional context, and whether the hospital configurations planned in the acute hospital development programme in the national development plan up to 2006 will assist the authority in achieving its objectives or if they need to be changed and what human resource implications and opportunities a plan of this scale presents for the authority.</P>
      <P>Measures to improve the overall management and delivery of accident and emergency services in the eastern region were given the go ahead at this month's meeting of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. We intend to put these measures in place rapidly. They include additional consultants and A&amp;E managers, the establishment of minor injury units in acute hospitals, improving the physical environments of A&amp;E departments and the treatment of patients with major trauma and critical non-trauma patients in a certain fashion. Specialist treatment units, particularly for conditions such as chest pain, deep vein thrombosis, respiratory illnesses and medical conditions, will be established in each acute hospital. This will help to ensure the smooth functioning of A&amp;E departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding was made available in December 2000 for a pilot project to evaluate the use of a dis<Col N="115" /> charge lounge in a large acute hospital in the region. Initiatives by the ERHA are already under way to address external delays such as pilot projects to establish how services can most effectively be developed to maintain older people at home and what strategies should be developed to prevent admission or readmission to an acute hospital setting. We are all aware that there gaps in the services. I am pleased that we have rapidly addressed these issues by putting in place managers for services for the elderly and other such features in the community to ensure that we maximise the use of facilities in the community.</P>
    <P>Funding of £5 million has already been allocated to contract an additional 495 step-down beds for the winter period to help alleviate pressure on A&amp;E departments. In line with a more co-ordinated approach to the availability of beds for emergency admissions, it is anticipated that a post of project manager based at ambulance headquarters will be established. This will enable a more appropriate allocation of emergency referrals between hospital sites, thus ensuring any one site is not unduly overcrowded. As chairman of the ERHA, I welcome these initiatives which, when fully implemented, will help to improve access to services, waiting times, patient flows and communications between medical staff and patients. I intend to make real progress as chairman and further progress in developing the type of health service which the public deserves, which we all want and of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine areas of failure and three calls for action mentioned in the Fine Gael motion. As Deputy Callely said, these issues did not crop up overnight. I cannot deal with all 12 points but I shall refer to one from each list. I was fascinated to see two big hitters from the previous Administration signing this motion, that is, Deputies Noonan and John Bruton. They were the decision-makers, with Deputies Quinn and Howlin, who formulated and implemented health policy. The list included the failure to relieve the chronic overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments. Each of those four Deputies were well aware of how bad the position was in the accident and emergency unit in Cork University Hospital&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but they did nothing about it. I refer specifically to the position in the Southern Health Board because I am familiar with it. I was chairman when Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health and Children. Those four decision-makers indicated that the accident and emergency unit in Cork University Hospital was designated to cater for 15,000 cases per year but was <Col N="116" /> then and still is dealing with 45,000 cases per year. That is the primary reason for the disgraceful situation of the elderly and other patients being left on trolleys while awaiting treating. My constituency colleague and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is dealing with the matter in a proper way with funding and staff support. That needs to be dealt with urgently. There was no response from those four gentlemen to the case made to them for an accident and emergency department. The Deputies who signed this motion will claim money was not as plentiful then. I could buy into that argument but why could even £1 million of the £20 million put into Limerick Regional Hospital not have gone to Cork?</P>

      <P>Dr. Peter Cusack, the accident and emergency consultant there, is doing an excellent job in poor conditions. It was he as a professional medial person who drew attention to the need for improvements and his report was ignored by the very people who tabled this hypocritical motion. The motion calls for the provision of adequate support services to allow older people to live in dignity and independence in the community. This is an opportune time to discuss this issue because there is a marvellous success <Col N="117" /> story to report. From 1986 onwards there was a moratorium on the provision of day and health centres. These are the most important ingredients in the provision of such care. Since last year, thanks to Government funding, the Southern Health Board has put in place an excellent programme for the elderly entitled Ageing with Confidence for the period 2000-10. The programme contains four modules, keeping older people well, supporting the older person at home, acute care and continuing care. All services for the elderly will be built on these initiatives. The relevant programme manager said: &ldquo;In light of the national development plan we are in the fortunate position to be able to plan with a fair degree of certainty the development that will take place over the next six years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last year's initiatives under that programme included £2.5 million extra for home helps, the employment of 19 additional staff in a range of disciplines and 19 additional CM2s &ndash; that post was previously ward sisters in community hospitals. Another £4.936 million was provided to complete or start day care centres in 11 locations. Separate funds were available for the refurbishment of existing community hospitals and a new community nursing unit in Cork city. Another £36.64 million is included for this and the next four years for work on community hospitals and other facilities for the elderly. Revenue funding to provide staff is also included.</P>

      <P>I had thought that because of the foot and mouth disease outbreak the monkey house in the zoo had been locked up, but it is clear two inmates of the august institution have escaped. I am pleased to welcome those two inmates, Deputies Neville and Browne, Carlow-Kilkenny. As the previous speaker said, this must be national brass-neck day. Earlier today Deputy Noonan was concerned about a Cork Deputy when he should have been concerned about his own party. Having listened to the heckling of the past 20 minutes, it is extraordinary. The reality is, and we all know and should be honest with ourselves and our constituents and the wider public, that the health service in terms of expenditure is an endless pit. It does not matter how much money is spent, there will always be a need in the health service for more. It ill behoves Deputies to move the hypocritical motion that has been moved because we all know there are problems and there will always be problems in the health service. Because of the developing nature of the health service, health technology and the challenges in the health service, there will always be resource difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the issue of resource difficulties, which Deputy Dennehy dealt with in clear detail, great efforts have been made by this Administration since coming to office. Health expenditure has increased by over 92% of the investment which was made during 1997 by the rainbow Government. There has been a virtual doubling of health spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members opposite can say, with reason, that because of the good economic management of the Government there is more money to spend. <Col N="119" /> Because of good public administration there is more money to spend, but there was not a dearth of funds in 1997. Fine Gael did not do the job.</P>
    <P>Capital spending under the NDP will treble. There is a special commitment this year of £44 million to spending on cancer which began in 1997 at a miserly £6 million. The crude statistics do not demonstrate a great deal except that there is a concern on this side of the House to do something positive about the health services. All the chattering abuse hurled at us does not give a fig to reality, which is recognised in the figures that have been published.</P>
    <P>The last Labour Party speaker referred to the care of the elderly. It is good to cast our minds back to when Deputies Noonan and Howlin had charge of such care. The total expenditure under the development funding for elderly services was a miserly £3 million in 1997. That is the year the elderly received an increase of £1.80 a week in their pensions.</P>

      <P>Capital spending, which has increased by 99%, has not produced a proportionate response. We all know that because when we take off the hats of mockery having left this House and go out into the real world we know there are problems.</P>
      <P>Government expenditure in each of the past four years has exceeded the rate of inflation. However, there must be more efficiency in expenditure. I am pleased, therefore, the Minister has introduced the notion of value for money. We must make sure the hospital and health services are delivering because there is no point in any of us deluding ourselves. Investing funds will not produce the results without proper management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The problem in our health services is management and not resources. There is a confusion of structures within the hospital and other health services. There is a need for whoever is in power to invest time and effort in restructuring acute hospitals and in putting in place proper management structures. The issue will not resolved during one Minister's tenure. It does not matter which party the Minister represents. Without proper management services in place we will not be capable of delivering the services all of us want.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to examine one area which requires courage and not money and that is the Child Care Act. There are problems in this area which I have been highlighting for a number of years. I hope, in addition to the strategy the Minister has laid out for health development, that one of the issues he will find time to address in a busy schedule, is a serious audit of that Act. That will be the next area of scandal which will need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>Did the Deputy ask the patients when he was in Government? It is obvious the Deputy and his party were not listening. I have a particular interest in the care of the elderly, and my constituency has quite a large elderly population. When I was elected I immediately sought support from my party for improvements in services for the elderly. This was from a very low level where the outgoing rainbow Coalition Government had decided to give the elderly increases which were below the level of inflation &ndash; an indication of its commitment to the care of the elderly. I am very proud of the performance of the current Minister and his predecessor in the treatment of the elderly and am proud that £71.6 million will be spent directly on services for the elderly in 2001.</P>
      <P>The health services will never be in such a position as to allow us say everything has been done. We are catching up from an era of cutbacks and from a lack of commitment in the past to fund the health services. I am glad my party in Government is reversing this trend.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the North Western Health Board retain and upgrade the breast care services at Sligo general hospital. This matter has arisen from a report by a sub-group to the national cancer forum on the development of services for systematic breast disease. In the case of the North Western Health Board area, the report indicated the population only supports one unit but that the geographical considerations dictate that an innovate approach is required to ensure services are available for patients in acceptable settings as far as possible. It also indicates that while there is a facility in Letterkenny and Sligo hospitals, Altnagelvin hospital in Derry can facilitate case load <Col N="123" /> work. I am asking that the upgrading of the service in Sligo be taken on board. Sligo has an insufficient population to justify a unit as the centres are based on a population in excess of 150,000. There is little infrastructure in Sligo general hospital in this area. Considerable resources would be required to establish a breast care unit, and I ask the Minister to allocate funding for this. The only realistic proposal is for health board boundaries to be crossed so the population of Sligo, Leitrim, west Cavan and parts of Mayo can be incorporated. It is estimated that if this were done the population would be adequate to provide a sufficient volume of patients, and would certainly justify Sligo general hospital serving those areas. This approach would need the co-operation and agreement of the chief executive officers and boards of each of the relevant health boards.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing that people from the west have to come to Dublin, which is quite a trauma for families. The Minister must indicate the provision of funding and examine the possibility of funding across health board boundaries, which would benefit the region. Funding should be provided and competition should not prevail. In the interests of patients it is very important that this facility be provided in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Sligo is the growth centre of the northwest. The North Western Health Board is doing an extraordinary job with the funding allocated by the State. With proper management this service could be provided in Sligo. I believe Letterkenny general hospital has a breast care centre. Given the cross-Border co-operation in many areas, including health, there should also be co-operation with Altnagelvin hospital in Derry.</P>
    <P>Funding is critically important in terms of providing this very necessary service in the northwest. I know a comprehensive survey was carried out by the sub-group, the recommendations of which have gone to Government, as have those of the National Cancer Forum on the development of services for systematic breast disease. It is a big concern for many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of nurses and the closed wards, especially in Dublin hospitals, will be seen as a monument to the way the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, dealt with the nurses' strike. There will be fewer nurses available in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can deny that the health services in general are in chaos. The problem is highlighted in a report recently done on major Dublin hospitals, such as Beaumont, St. Vincent's, St. James's and Tallaght, which shows there is a major crisis in terms of lack of nurses, beds, etc. These hospitals deal with the serious health problems of people from Cavan-Monaghan and are relevant to a very large region. In addition we have the waiting lists and the problems associated with getting somebody into St. Luke's hospital for <Col N="124" /> cancer treatment, which is extremely serious &ndash; I have had personal knowledge of that situation with family members in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Recently a young mother had to spend four or five hours after having her first child in Holles Street hospital before being put into the seventh bed in a six bed ward. The mother and child were discharged the following day. I raise this because maternity wards in Monaghan general hospital and Dundalk hospital have been closed by the North Eastern Health Board. The Minister failed to ensure this did not happen. The closure is supposed to be temporary. It means 35% more patients will have to be dealt with in Cavan and Drogheda hospitals. Is this the type of treatment that our mothers and future generations deserve? Will they soon be in the same position as the mother I mentioned in Holles Street Hospital?</P>
    <P>The situation in Dundalk and Monaghan hospitals must be re-examined. We were promised £10 million for restructuring and upgrading Monaghan general hospital, but nothing has happened with the exception of the replacement of an outside theatre and the refurbishment of the female medical ward. There is a total lack of morale among patients and staff. There is a great urgency to ensure the planning and work is started on Monaghan general hospital. We heard how the Minister is spending millions of pounds in Cork and we know the previous Minister spent money in Laoighis-Offaly. We have heard accusations that the leader of our party, Deputy Michael Noonan, did the same in Limerick when he was Minister. There is a yawning need for a fair service throughout the country. The smaller general hospitals must be maintained and serviced. In north Monaghan young mothers are now expected to travel more than 50 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Accident and emergency cases cannot be dealt with properly, even though the hospital is along the main Dublin-Derry and Belfast-Galway roads. It is also an area of production in the food and furniture industries where the work is very dangerous. We need a proper accident and emergency service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise one specific issue, namely the deplorable condition of the county hospital in Roscommon. On two occasions there was a Member of this House representing the hospital, yet during the years matters have gone from bad to worse. The hospital is like something from the Second World War. There are trolleys everywhere: on the aisle, between the beds, in the television room and even in the accident and emergency unit. On an average night there are 15 trolleys in the accident and emergency unit. The wards are completely overcrowded and if a cardiac cart had to be brought to a patient in the wards it would be impossible to get it in because of the overcrowding. Staff in the hospital are working in deplorable conditions. If such conditions applied in a factory, it would be closed on health and safety grounds, yet this issue continues <Col N="125" /> to be ignored and the hospital receives no investment.</P>
      <P>Patients are safer going home than staying in Roscommon County Hospital because of the lack of investment. The Government announced three and a half years ago that there would be a new accident and emergency unit for the hospital, but construction has not yet commenced. The Government took the funding away from the new accident and emergency unit and we will only get the investment back under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Conditions in the hospital are so bad that the staff are looking for transfers out of it. We have had debates about staff shortages in Dublin, but while we have capable staff in Roscommon, the lack of investment by the Minister and his Department means that the staff are trying to get out of the hospital. They are of the view that the Government is trying to wind the hospital down by not investing in it. The Minister should come and see the conditions in which the staff are working when he will see the lack of investment for himself. He will see the need for investment and additional beds; if that investment is not made, we will not have staff and we will not have the hospital, though we need an acute hospital in Roscommon.</P>

        <b>:</b> Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo. Níl ach trí nóiméad agam. Three minutes is hopeless in this situation, especially when I have to respond to the nonsense I heard from some Fianna Fáil Deputies. Deputy Dennehy is always sent in here to upset me and he managed to convince himself that Deputy Noonan spent a pile of money in Limerick and none in Cork, but then he proceeded to outline all the money being spent in Cork.</P>
      <P>The Chair knows that St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and Carlow District Hospital are crying out for money to the extent that the consultants and medical staff are coming to meet the Minister soon to find out if the former can be saved from falling apart and if demoralisation can be halted among staff. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe is completely overwhelmed by the idea that we have an excellent leader and spent most of his speech trying to find fault with Deputy Noonan. He is obviously very upset by our excellent choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of funding have been given, but in fairness one must compare like with like. One cannot talk about what was spent eight, ten or 40 years ago when there is a budget surplus now. During the summer I spent four weeks visiting a public hospital ward and four weeks visiting a private ward. I could not understand why the roast beef in the public ward did not look like the roast beef in the private ward. The standard of food in public hospitals should be investigated. I cannot generalise, but this is a case of a Dublin hospital which has public and private wards. There is no defence for its as good food in a hospital is as important in the public ward as it is <Col N="126" /> for those who can afford private care. The standard of hospital food should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Despite the beautifully written script read by one Fianna Fáil Deputy giving figures about the falling numbers on waiting lists, there are still problems. One recent case involved a child who had to wait 15 months to have a tooth surgically removed. Another problem relates to elderly people being sent home from hospitals. Recently an 89-year old was sent home from a hospital even though he still needed medical care; he went to his son, who lived in a different part of the county. This is unacceptable. Elderly people need medical care when they need it and sending people home to a house without mod cons is unacceptable. We must make an effort to look after such people. I congratulate our health spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on his wonderful policy document, which will deal with the reality of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister is not present. He should accept that there is a crisis in the health services because if he does not, he cannot cure it. At the end of last year the Minister made great play with the fact that waiting lists nationally had reduced by 5,000, according to him. That was simply distorting the figures, as waiting lists were only reduced because many general practitioners are reluctant to refer patients to hospitals because of the length of waiting lists. Thousands are hoping to be placed on the waiting lists as they are waiting for appointments with consultants.</P>
      <P>The lists are being reduced by what hospitals call validating the lists; this involves writing to people to inquire if they are alive or if they have had the procedure in question carried out privately. Lists are being falsely reduced in this way. The manager of University College Hospital Galway informed me that the longest a person has spent on a waiting list is ten years, which is a scandal. Is that the service of which Government Deputies McGennis and O'Keeffe are proud? I would not be proud of it.</P>
      <P>A person who was distressed called to my clinic recently because they had received a letter calling a relative for surgery, though the relative was seven years dead. That is a fact. The relative died in 1994 and was only then being called for attention. Nobody could be proud of that situation, not even disappointed Fianna Fáil Ministers of State. It is a good thing we only have a few minutes to speak as we could talk about this for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much red tape involved in appointments. The Minister informed me in January 2000 that he had approved the appointment of a second neurologist at University College Hospital Galway. However, 14 months later the position has not been filled; it is only now being advertised because of the red tape which slows down such appointments. The health board must apply to the Department to fill the post, the Minister must then approve the filling of the post, after its approval by the Department the Minister must <Col N="127" /> seek the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal. When Comhairle approves the post the matter is referred back to the Western Health Board. That is ridiculous red tape. I ask the Minister to address this problem and cut down on red tape. The second consultant neurologist to be appointed to UCGH will replace a consultant who is due to retire this year. We will, therefore, need two instead of one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Government backbenchers who say that there was never as much money spent on health, but they fail to realise that the Minister is not delivering the service. To say otherwise is to ignore the facts and a grave disservice to the people they claim to represent. It is also a grave disservice to the Minister, because if he is not aware of the situation on the ground, it is our duty to tell him how we see it in our everyday dealings with concerned families. There are waiting lists for simple and major operations and for people being placed in care. That is unacceptable given there was never as much money as there is now. The economy should be all-inclusive, but people are being left out and they feel hurt about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should be particularly interested in the case of Cavan General Hospital. A mammography machine was installed there courtesy of the Friends of Cavan General Hospital, but has not been commissioned to date despite repeated requests, a public meeting in Cavan town and 21,000 signatures to support the machine being commissioned. That is a disgrace given how sensitive and problematic the issue is.</P>
      <P>I can give the example of two families in Cavan. One family returned from England with their handicapped daughter. They had been assured by the North Eastern Health Board before they came home that their daughter would be placed in care in the unit in Castleblayney. Eighteen months later that has not happened. That is an affront to those people and an insult to their care for their daughter whom they thought would be better off coming back to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The second case relates to a young man of 35 years who is mentally handicapped. He is living with his elderly parents. This is a tragic case and an example of what is happening throughout the country. This young man was placed in open care in an institution not far from his home in Cavan town. He arrived home one day, barefoot and in his pyjamas, having walked a distance of 15 miles. There is no place for him. His parents are elderly and this young man seldom sleeps for more than one hour in the day. The family are distraught. I have tried everything to help them and I have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he is delivering a service. He should deliver a service to the two families I mentioned. At least then we would see something being done for somebody. I can give a list of such cases, although these are the most traumatic and sad. There are others in the context of caring for <Col N="128" /> the elderly, an ongoing issue. We are failing to deal with it. We mention institutions and nursing homes but they are not the solution in caring for the elderly. These people want to live their retiring years in their own homes where they feel comfortable and independent.</P>

      <P>A recent public meeting in Longford on health issues was attended by 600 people. I am anxious to convey some of the sentiments expressed at that meeting, especially in relation to Longford Westmeath general hospital in Mullingar. Phase 2B of this project has been awaited for a number of years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan, when he was Minister for Health, continued the building of this project but then the trail went cold. Nothing happened because all funding went to Tullamore which was given top priority. Where else in the civilised world would one find such a building being left empty for three years? There is nothing in it. A project team was put together in the recent past but now extra services are required and the health board has again put the project on the long finger. These services are needed. That is the reason they are due to be installed in this building. However, what are people supposed to do in the meantime? What have they done for the last three years?</P>
      <P>It is hard to watch what is happening in the health services. A constituent came to my clinic recently in great distress. He had come from a hospital where he had been told it would be two years before he would undergo surgery. That is the situation and all the PR and spin doctors in the world, as well as the dark suits, blue shirts and colourful ties, will not change it. That is the service this Government has given and the people will not forget it. I compliment Deputy Noonan on pinpointing the real issue in this country &ndash; the lack of health services. People are suffering. As far as they are concerned there is no tiger in the health services. If this Government does not get the health services together, this party and others will when they form the next Government.</P>

      <P>For the past three months I have been engaged almost full time in a struggle to save the maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital. That campaign reached its height in the month of February and necessitated my absence for a considerable period from this House during that month.</P>
      <P>I little suspected when I was elected for Cavan-Monaghan that such a struggle would be necessary. The unprecedented resources in the hands of the Government made it almost unthinkable that there should be a return to the days of closures and cutbacks. However, this year we have seen the closure of maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital, despite widespread opposition from patients, staff and the citizens of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a massive public campaign, including a rally organised by the county council. <Col N="129" /> Almost 35,000 people signed a petition to retain the service but the closure still went ahead. The Minister says the responsibility lies with the health board, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal and with the consultant representative bodies. However, the buck must stop somewhere and it stops with the Minister. He has a democratically mandated responsibility for the health services and he must ensure they are both equitable and efficient.</P>
    <P>The motion lists this Government's catalogue of failure on a national level. At a county level, I and 35,000 others can testify to the neglect of a key service at our hospital and its callous closure at the behest of unaccountable health service bureaucrats while the Minister washed his hands. I no longer have confidence in the health board system of delivery of health care in the acute services sector. I have no confidence either in the willingness of this Government to provide the root and branch reform of the health services which is required to end the two-tier system that currently exists.</P>
    <P>The closure of maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk is a shameful episode and the people of Counties Monaghan and Louth will not forget it. They also will not give up the fight to restore and upgrade the services which have been so unjustly taken away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed at the performances of Deputies Batt O'Keeffe and Dennehy and by their personal attacks on Deputy Noonan. I do not know how the Minister could permit that; it was disgusting. Obviously, Deputy Noonan is hurting Fianna Fáil. They are mindful, no doubt, of the respect in which he is held among the medical fraternity. To accuse him of doing a bad job for the nurses at the time of their dispute is ridiculous. Deputy Noonan set up the commission on nursing and, even though there were not many resources available, he secured £60 million from the Exchequer for the improvement of nurses' salaries. Overall, he did a good job at that time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the hepatitis issue, apart from one mistake for which he apologised to the House and to the public and which he will forever regret, he did an extremely good job. He established the compensation tribunal and saved those unfortunate people a great deal of money. When Fianna Fáil came into office, it did little more than build on what Deputy Noonan achieved in office. It is a bit rich of Fianna Fáil speakers to attack him on his performance as Minister for Health. He was in office for two and a half years and did excellent work. He handled difficult situations sensitively, including the introduction of legislation which Fianna Fáil would not have dealt with if that party had been in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine why Deputy Dennehy and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe should be so ebullient in the Dáil. One need only look at what they have done in the Southern Health Board. They have desecrated the service in Kerry and run rings around their Fianna Fáil colleagues. There is only <Col N="130" /> one Fine Gael representative from Kerry on the health board while there are five Fianna Fáil representatives. In the strategy for health in the national development plan, less than 3% of the funding was committed to Kerry. The rest goes to Cork. There probably are better facilities in Cork in the last three years but the service in Kerry has been destroyed.</P>
    <P>People are left on trolleys in Tralee General Hospital, something that never happened previously. The hospital is under-resourced and under-staffed. There is a five year waiting time for people attending the out-patients surgical theatre. They are awaiting simple procedures, such as gall stones and varicose veins surgery. These conditions can turn cancerous unless they are treated. The consultants can do nothing. A third consultant was appointed but there was no provision for extra space, theatre space and other supports. As a result, that surgeon cannot operate over weekends or even late in the evening. This is a serious situation for a large number of women.</P>
    <P>A building plan for Tralee general hospital was submitted to the Minister. I appeal to civil servants to prioritise Tralee as it is obvious the Southern Health Board will not do so. I recently tabled a motion in Kerry County Council requesting the chief executive and his programme managers to attend the council so we could question them on their performances in Kerry. They refused to attend which was an admission that they have not looked after the people of Kerry.</P>
    <P>Until recently there was not an epidural service in Tralee so many women had to go to Cork for this service. The breast screening service in Tralee was also threatened. The current service is inadequate but there was a threat to relocate it to Cork.</P>
    <P>There is a three-year waiting list for orthodontic treatment in Kerry. The Minister promised to appoint an orthodontic specialist but this has not happened. This is the longest waiting list in any health board area and the waiting time in Kerry is longer than in Cork. I am delighted to have the opportunity to outline the situation in the Southern Health Board where there is total discrimination against Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Opposition Members have accused the Government of throwing money at the health service and getting nothing in return. However, the Government is investing money in the health service and getting results in return. These results are in infrastructure, reducing waiting lists, proper plans on cancer and, in particular, in child care which is my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a strategy for how to spend the money and how to deliver the service, which it is doing. Members have referred to the reduction in waiting lists due to the additional allocation of £34 million. There has been progress in breast screening where 120,000 women have been invited to participate in the programme. <Col N="131" /> Women between the ages of 50 and 64 who are most at risk have been given this opportunity to ensure their health risk is identified and that they are helped. Many Members highlighted the fact that the cancer initiative has been expanded with the appointment of 28 consultants meaning that people throughout the country are getting the service they so badly need.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, an additional £90 million and more has been invested in child care. This investment means that, for the first time, children are a priority. There is now investment in family support, early intervention and the protection of children so that, we hope, in ten years we will not see the type of troubled children who are coming before the High Court nowadays. These children did not get the service they needed at the end of the 1980s, for which all Governments were responsible. However, at least the investment is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>It is not just a case of investment but of investment with a strategy and a plan. The plan is based on the national children's strategy launched last year which ensured that, last year alone, there was additional investment in staff throughout the country. This year up to 600 or 700 child care posts can be created. There is a national children's office to deliver co-ordination between different areas and there are &ldquo;children first&rdquo; guidelines which ensure that children are protected, identified if at risk and that people know the proper procedures to follow.</P>
    <P>I am not just looking to the past, to criticise what other Governments have done or to hail what this Government has done. I will also outline where we are going. Our investment will be coupled with growth, a plan and a strategy. Plans in my area of responsibility include a White Paper on the mandatory reporting of child abuse which will set out the Govenrment's policy on how to protect children.</P>
    <P>I will bring legislation to Government shortly in the area of adoption on the ratification of The Hague convention which will ensure that children coming to Ireland from abroad for inter-country adoption can be protected. I will also bring forward legislation concerning an information and contact register which will give rights to people who have been adopted and who are seeking information. The new health strategy will set out a fair and equitable access to health care and will be backed by funding.</P>

      <P>Funding for the health service has been increased by £2 billion or £3 billion in the past few years but problems persist and may be getting worse. It is difficult to explain these difficulties to constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> One of my main complaints about the Minister is that his style of running the Department is based more on image than substance. One example of this approach was the budget announcement of free medical cards for all people over 70. I tabled a parliamentary question last week to see if there had been any discussions with medical practitioners regarding how this measure would be implemented or the impact it might have on the service. However, nothing was organised or had been arranged. This highlights the fact that an announcement is made after which the policy follows.</P>
    <P>The orthodontic service in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is a disgrace and has been going on for several years. I cannot establish who is to blame for this situation but the buck has to stop with the Minister. I have tabled parliamentary questions for four years concerning people who were originally on a waiting list for three or four years when I started and who are still on a waiting list. Children diagnosed as priority cases at the age of six or seven are now 12 or 13 and have not been attended to. The same bland answers are offered for this situation stating that there is an industrial dispute, the matter is <i>sub judice</i> and cannot be dealt with. I have received telephone commitments that more orthodontists are being taken on in Loughlinstown, Naas or wherever but nothing seems to happen. The lists grow longer.</P>
    <P>Families are not contacted. There was a controversy regarding this issue just after Christmas following which <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a headline to the effect that tax credits of 25% or 50% and a grant of a few per cent were to be offered to those on orthodontic waiting lists. However, we now discover this is to be a pilot scheme in the Northern Area Health Board area but there is nothing concrete to address the problem.</P>
    <P>There was dispute in this area and a judgment was made. However, will the Minister outline what I should tell families, parents and young children? Should they seek private treatment or should they hold on? Ten thousand people in the ERHA region are on the waiting list. It would be some assistance to these people if the Department had the courtesy to contact them by letter outlining the situation and giving a projected date when they would be dealt with. This is the least the families are owed.</P>
    <P>Wicklow is an unusual county in that there are four dioceses and no third level institution or general hospital. The county is serviced by hospitals in Loughlinstown, Tallaght and Naas. If an accident occurs, ambulances may bring the victims to Naas only for them to be transferred to Tallaght a short time later. Tallaght might be nearer than Naas to the scene of the accident. I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue but the reply did not refer to Naas hospital and was geared to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>If, God forbid, I am involved in an accident going home tonight at Poulaphuca or Hollywood why does the ambulance have to bring me to <Col N="133" /> Naas which does not have the facilities which are available in Tallaght? Who is looking after whom?</P>
    <P>The time has come for Wicklow to examine the idea of establishing a general hospital. There is a new hospital in Tallaght and St. Vincent's hospital is on the south side of Dublin. However, the area from Bray to Wexford does not have a general hospital. Wicklow town and Arklow have been identified as areas of major growth over the next few years and it is time to consider building a general hospital in Wicklow. If needs be, Loughlinstown Hospital should be closed down. It is an old sanatorium and, in my view, although it might offend some people, it is a case of throwing good money after bad. It should be closed and sold off for development land. A general hospital could then be built in Newcastle. That would be a productive thing to do and it will happen later anyway. The Minister should take into consideration the idea of building a general hospital. All parties have welcomed the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority but I am beginning to wonder if we have not created a monster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government stands indicted on its delivery of the health services. People's health is very important to them and over the generations we heard the old adage, &ldquo;Your health is your wealth&rdquo;. The present health service is a disgrace. In 1999 alone we saw an unbelievable figure of 24,590 patients being readmitted to hospital within one week of discharge. What is happening? Under this Government, almost 500 patients are discharged each week only to be back in hospital within one week. This is a disgrace and the Minister must explain what is happening. Why are hospital staff forced to discharge patients before they are ready? What damage is done to their health because of this practice? The Minister for Health and Children must take urgent action to alleviate the suffering caused to these patients. He must intervene to remove the risk to the lives of these patients because they are not physically ready for discharge. Many who are so discharged are elderly people who worked hard in bad times, paid their taxes and created the foundation for our present wealth. It is not acceptable that the Government fails to give them a decent health service in their declining years.</P>
      <P>The treatment of mental health has been neglected and under-funded. Mental illness has been the Cinderella of the health service. The attention and resources given to this area are a scandal. Why are provisions in this area not on a par with the general health and hospital services, albeit with its many faults? If there was justice in society the service provided for the mentally ill would be recognised as one of the greatest scandals of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-standard state of long stay institutions is unacceptable. Some institutions are in very bad repair and are symbolic of a different era. All <Col N="134" /> psychiatric institutions which were constructed prior to 1900 should be closed down. Acute psychiatric units should be provided by modern purpose built hospitals for long stay patients. The Government should provide acute psychiatric units in general hospitals for patients in need of acute short stay treatment.</P>
    <P>There will always be a small number of long-term disturbed patients and modern special secure facilities must be made available for them. What is happening now is a disgrace. In the new millennium these services should not have younger patients, functional psychotic patients, and patients with intellectual disabilities sharing the same ward. It is an affront to the dignity of each of these groups. As a matter of urgency the Government should introduce segregation for each of these groups.</P>
    <P>There is now overwhelming evidence that psychiatric services concentrating on rapid response and community settings are superior to more conventional services. A community early intervention service should be introduced to provide a rapid response service for patients with severe mental illness. The service should see patients in their houses and other appropriate settings, including general practices, the community based day centres or, relatively rarely, in hospital. This should be styled on the hospice services.</P>
    <P>In his rambling speech on this motion, the Minister assured the House that he had provided unprecedented levels of funding for health services. If the Minister has that sort of money he should be appearing before a tribunal of inquiry. As the Fine Gael motion states, the taxpayers, through this House, are contributing unprecedented levels of funding for health services. This Minister is not providing a penny. Furthermore, he is not making decisions because he will not take on any hard issues. Though it is a hard act to follow, he will leave the Department of Health and Children as badly led as the Cromien report showed he left the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The public is not yet aware of the Minister's role in what one consultant last week called a mess, because the Minister spent £800,000 of the taxpayers' money on high visibility con job photo opportunities. How many orthodontic procedures could poor children, whose teeth are growing crookedly, have received with that £800,000?</P>
    <P>The Minister, with his Cabinet colleagues, is quite happy to appear for soft media opportunities but when difficult questions have to be answered, be they about health or foot and mouth disease, it is very often the Minister of State who is left to face the music. This Minister fails to give leadership because he cannot make a decision.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech on this motion he told us he had created a forum to look into manpower issues, a national joint steering group on working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, which he will consider, a review of bed capacity, a study of the impact of different measures on <Col N="135" /> reducing waiting lists, a review of the role of general practice, a review of value for money audits within the health system and plans for the future which would provide the foundations for unspecified work.</P>
    <P>He said he had entered into lengthy negotiations on reform, again unspecified, and has begun consultations on a new health strategy. Our party's spokesman on Health, Deputy Gay Mitchell, asked the Minister a parliamentary question on the health needs of prisoners. He refused to answer and transferred the question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who replied that, as one might have guessed, he is carrying out a review. All this after four years in office.</P>
    <P>There are more varieties of commissions, inquiries, fora, review groups, consultation processes, steering groups, committees and commissions under this Minister for Health and Children than there are varieties of Heinz food products. There have been more than 57 varieties of such costly dogs' dinners which are excuses for inaction. The Minister and his Government have made a right meatball mess, though not of the Heinz variety, of overseeing what should be one of Europe's leading health services.</P>
    <P>Instead, we now have a Third World health service complete with caste system. The poorer you are, the tougher it is, while the wealthy are seen immediately and live longer. The reality is that poor people suffer more and die younger. According to ESRI research on Irishmen aged 55 to 64, higher professionals have a death rate of 13 per 1000 while for semi-skilled men this figure rose to 22 per 1000, and for unskilled manual groups it is 32 per 1000. The mortality rate is almost three times higher among lower income groups than better paid professional groups.</P>
    <P>Access to GPs and medicines in primary care, together with access to hospitals when needed, would help reduce the number of deaths among poorer persons. I would not be so direct about this were it not for the Minister's unnecessary and personalised guff handed out here and aimed at the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour, and the respective policy documents of both parties. Our policies are not perfect but they put forward sensible, innovative and imaginative proposals to tackle an unprecedented crisis in the health services and one which is acutely borne by those without large bank accounts.</P>
    <P>This is real sleaze. This is why the Minister refuses to embrace Fine Gael policy which is the creation of a unified health system, with a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients and providers, overseen by a health ombudsman. Unfortunately, indecision and prevarication are the hallmarks of this Government. The Minister has no new ideas, no capacity for decisions, no sense of reform and no feel for the suffering his lack of leadership has caused.</P>

      <P>In the <i>Citywide News</i> published on 27 February it was reported that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, stated that &ldquo;Linguistic and cultural diversity present real opportunity&rdquo; at the launch of the European Year of Languages. The information I am about to impart to the House in respect of courses offered at Tallaght Institute of Technology brings into sharp focus the Minister's assertion on that date.</P>
      <P>For the past ten years the Institute of Technology in Tallaght has offered a very appealing language and marketing course which has attracted a large number of students to attend the institute. There is a high placement rate among graduates of this course, which offers a sequential progression from certificate to diploma to degree level. It is now proposed, for reasons which are unclear, to withdraw, from students already enrolled at the college, the option of pursuing a degree in marketing and languages and to replace this with a single marketing course where the language element has been so emasculated as to significantly reduce the value of the qualification and, accordingly, the employment prospects, on graduation, of the students involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions arise from these proposed changes, which the college authorities and the Minister must address. First, are the proposed changes so manifestly unfair as to be illegal? Students who entered this course in recent years are finding the ground rules changing, thus denying them their legitimate expectations of a degree in marketing and languages. This was obviously available to them as an option when they originally enrolled in the college. Second, who is responsible for this proposal? Is it the sole responsibility of the college authorities? What role, if any, has the NCEA played in this? Third, what consultations, if any and with whom, took place before this proposal entered the public domain. Pupils have complained to my office that they were effectively presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> Fourth, what is the main <i>raison d'être</i> for the proposed change? Does it have anything to do with the significant increase in enrolment of first year students on the course last September and the consequent strain this has placed on financial and human resources? Fifth, if such a change is <Col N="137" /> desirable and defensible, should it not only be introduced on a phased basis applying only to students who enrol after 1 September 2001? Sixth, given the success of the course to date, is change of any sort really necessary?</P>
    <P>These proposed changes have caused considerable upset to the students directly involved. It is a classic case of how not to implement change. I appeal to the Minister not to pull the plug on the course on which students had set their hearts when the entered the college. If change is necessary, let it be on a planned and phased basis coming into effect next September for those enrolling at the college for the first time. The change should not be made in the arbitrary and authoritarian fashion in which it has been proposed and foisted upon students without prior consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to clarify the current position in respect of this matter. As the issues raised are matters for which the institute has responsibility under the relevant Acts, it would be useful if I set out the legislative position in relation to the governance of the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992 to 1999, the governing body and the director of an institute of technology are responsible for the management and control of its affairs. Under the Act, it is a function of the institute to provide such courses of study as its governing body considers appropriate, subject to the annual programme and budget approval process laid down in the Act. The Act also requires each institute to have an academic council appointed by the governing body to assist in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the institute and to protect, maintain and develop the academic standards of the courses and activities of the institute.</P>
      <P>The functions, which the academic council has under the Act, include the following: to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of structures which enable the implementation of appropriate courses of study in accordance with the institute's annual programmes and budget allocation; to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement courses of study; and to propose to the governing body, subject to the requirements of the National Council for Educational Awards or other relevant authority, the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and the evaluation of academic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised in relation to the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, the position is that, while it is not appropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to become involved in the detail of this matter, he has asked the college to provide him with information on this course <Col N="138" /> and it has advised him that its position is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Institute of Technology, Tallaght, is required to review its courses on a regular basis to ensure their relevance and career enhancing prospects. It is normal practice in the sector for courses to be amended or replaced in line with changes in the workplace and in response to comments from graduates and employers.</P>
    <P>This takes the form of a five yearly &ldquo;Programmatic Review&rdquo;; a process agreed between the awarding body (the National Council for Educational Awards) and the Institutes of Technology. It involves a thorough self-study by the academic unit under review in terms of its operations, management and academic programmes. In particular, the programmatic review investigates whether courses have been modified and modernised as a result of the development of new knowledge and a changing economic environment. The Peer Review Group, which undertakes this process, is drawn from experts in universities, other Institutes of Technology, the NCEA and business. A highly qualified panel of respected peers agreed to undertake this important task on behalf of the Institute. A major function of this peer review group is to recommend continuing accreditation of courses. The Peer Review Group assessed all of the courses on offer in Business (Accounting and Business Administration &amp; Management as well as those in Marketing). They made recommendations in relation to the operation and structure of all these courses. The changes recommended in the Marketing Courses followed a thorough review of all the Documents submitted by the Department of Management and a day long meeting with the Head of School, Head of Department and teaching staff.</P>
    <P>The Department submitted two suites of marketing courses to the Programmatic Review Group viz.: a National Certificate, National Diploma and BBS Degree in Marketing and a National Certificate, National Diploma and BBS Degree in Marketing with a Language. Despite cogent arguments by the Institute's staff with regard to this latter suite of courses, the Review Group was strongly of the opinion that the suites of courses, i.e. Marketing and Marketing with a Language, were not sufficiently different to merit two separate Certificates of Course Recognition. Instead they recommended a single suite of courses at National Certificate, National Diploma and BBS level in Marketing, with two streams, viz., a Language stream and a Business Development Stream.</P>
    <P>Courses in Institute of Technology, Tallaght are structured on the progression model, which allow students who apply and are qualified to be selected for follow-on courses at Diploma and Degree level. The Institute tries at all times <Col N="139" /> to facilitate progression for suitably qualified students, however places on follow-on courses are generally limited and awarded on an order of merit basis. In rationalising the suite of Marketing courses, the Institute has ensured that the total number of places previously available on the Marketing and Marketing and Languages Diplomas and degrees remains unchanged and are now available on the revised Diploma and Degree in Marketing. The Marketing courses have not been abandoned, rather modernised and rationalised to ensure appropriate levels of the knowledge and skills in business needed in the current marketplace. The Institute would be remiss in its duty to students and in its obligations under the Regional Technical College Acts if it did not amend courses as economic and educational circumstances change. Students who wish to continue with their major foreign language can do so.</P>
    <P>The situation which arose recently in Institute of Technology, Tallaght, and which the Deputy has raised here this evening is a matter for the institute.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le hoifig an Cheann Chomhairle a thug cead dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a phlé. What steps does the Minister intend to take to end the daily occurrence of overcrowding at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and the resultant treatment of acutely ill medical in-patients on the hospital corridors? The position is that anything up to 12 acutely ill elderly patients are being treated on the hospital corridors almost on a daily basis. They have little or no privacy. Their personal belongings are left on the end of their beds. It is difficult if not impossible to bring medical equipment to them and staff at all levels, medical, nursing, non-nursing and administrative, are totally frustrated by the situation that has developed and which continues to be in place.</P>
      <P>The lack of medical beds in the hospital has its genesis in cutbacks in medical beds in the south Tipperary area in the mid-1980s when St. Vincent's Hospital in Tipperary Town, with 50 medical beds, was closed by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day. From that day on, there has been difficulty in relation to the question of medical patients being treated on hospital corridors. Staff at all levels are frustrated by the difficulties that have arisen. Patients and their relatives are frustrated also with what is occurring on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that industrial action is currently being balloted on by the non-nursing staff who are represented by the SIPTU trade union in the hospital? They find it impossible to do their work and they have drawn attention to various health and safety matters arising from treating patients on the hospital corridors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Is the Minister aware also of the unacceptable proposal to reduce the number of gynaecological beds in the hospital to try to deal with this problem? That is totally unacceptable and it involves the cancellation of gynaecological procedures in a situation where the gynaecological ward has already been reduced by six beds. Has the South Eastern Health Board applied to the Department for more funds to provide additional beds to deal with this problem? If so, when did it apply? What funds did it request and when does the Minister propose to approve that application?</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will refer in his reply to the capital development at the hospital, which is welcome but long overdue. However, it will not address this problem since additional medical beds are not involved in that project. Will the Minister take immediate steps to put additional beds in the system in south Tipperary to ensure that patients are treated as human beings and cared for in proper conditions in wards in the hospital. I ask him to put back into the system the 50 beds taken out of it in the 1980s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded me this evening by Deputy Healy to set out the position in relation to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. I apologise for being somewhat late.</P>
      <P>In the South Eastern Health Board region, in-patient numbers increased by an average of 6% for acute hospitals during the period January 2000 to October 2000. In an effort to deal with this increased demand, the health board recently appointed a bed manager to St. Joseph's Hospital. It has also designated a 12 bed convalescent unit as part of the community nursing unit in Clonmel and has contracted private nursing home beds to facilitate earlier discharge from the hospital. Detailed proposals submitted by the health board for additional beds under the bed capacity review are currently being considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In terms of the overall development of services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, contracts have been signed in relation to phase 1 of the development at the hospital and enabling work has commenced on site. This landmark development in the history of the health services in south Tipperary will involve the provision of a new accident and emergency department, ward accommodation, operating theatres, ICU, day care unit, central sterile supplies department, physical medicine department, education centre and consulting rooms. I know the Deputy will concur when I say this development will represent a hugely significant advance in the quality of service that will be available to south Tipperary hospital patients, and the Government deserves to be given some credit for the significant investment it is making in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which <Col N="141" /> the Government agreed. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium-term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. Further work is now being undertaken to develop a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The second phase of the review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, I announced in October 2000 a £25 million investment package to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period. The investment package was targeted at a number of key areas including approval to recruit 29 additional accident and emergency consultants; approval to recruit 15 additional consultant anaesthetists; provision to contract at least 500 additional nursing home places for patients who have completed the acute phase of treatment; and provision of additional aids and supports for older persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about those on trolleys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This initiative was quite effective during the winter period, in particular the provisions relating to the additional nursing home beds we contracted into the system and the provision of additional aids and supports for older people in the community and in their homes. Many people benefited from this increased investment. The 29 accident and emergency posts and the 15 anaesthetist posts have been sanctioned, which is the largest investment ever in human resources in terms of the accident and emergency area. We have a great deal of work to do in accident and emergency but we are providing both the capital infrastructure and, more importantly, we are providing the resources to employ accident and emergency consultants in the various hospitals across the system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the South Eastern Health Board area, we have provided additional funding of £1.5 million to alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector in 2001. Funding totalling £2.981 million was also provided to the South Eastern Health Board in the year 2000 for waiting list initiatives in the board's area and a further £1.750 million has already been provided this year. There was a reduction of 17.4% in the overall waiting list figures for the period 31 December 1999 to 30 September 2000 in the South Eastern Health Board area, with a reduction of 20% in the corresponding period at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. Clearly extra work is in evidence in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and I thank all the staff for their commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective is to ensure that the services available to the people of south Tipperary are responsive to their needs and I know that the <Col N="142" /> developments under planning and under way will be seen as tangible evidence of my commitment in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the House tonight to deal with the serious concerns of many people in relation to this important issue.</P>
      <P>In recent years I have made many representations to the Minister's office and raised in the Dáil the issue of my concerns with respect to scaling down the Garda presence in several rural areas of Wicklow and east Carlow. This is a problem that spans the country from Donegal to Waterford. Many communities have formed action groups to address the problem and I am aware that they too have been in direct contact with the Minister's office.</P>
      <P>The Wicklow-east Carlow area is especially susceptible to small time criminals who specialise in multiple crimes during a late night excursion from the city. Many of the small towns they hit are manned by gardaí for only a few hours at set times.</P>
      <P>This practice is growing. Recent reports indicate that the steering group set up to restructure the Garda is considering the proposal that stations with fewer than four gardaí be closed, as a cost cutting measure. If implemented this will have a serious negative impact on communities throughout the country and the state of law and order. It would have implications for at least 12 locations in my constituency &ndash; Roundwood, Dunlavin, Tinahely, Hollywood, Ashford, Avoca, Aughrim, Carnew, Enniskerry, Shillelagh, Rathvilly and Haggartstown.</P>
      <P>Some sources cast doubt on the authenticity of the reports but they have caused concern in many communities. The Garda's main strength is the ability to intermingle with the community which affords them a great insight into how society functions. It assists in nipping potential problems in the bud. Loss of this facility would cause serious long-term difficulties. Will the Minister tell us what is the status of these proposals and outline the recommendations put forward? Will he confirm that there is no threat to stations with fewer than four gardai and that he is considering the feasibility of increasing the numbers in these neglected areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for sharing his time. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, while on this side of the House made great play of zero tolerance and it is with incredulity that I read that on his watch in the Department consultants had the audacity to suggest proposals that <Col N="143" /> would diminish his reputation with Deloitte &amp; Touche suggesting the closure of stations with fewer than four gardaí. Deputy Timmins referred to stations in Wicklow but in my own constituency I can name many stations which fall into this category &ndash; Ballyvourney, Inchigeelagh, Ballingarry, Tarelton, Varnans, Coachford and Dunamore. There is fear in these communities that while the Minister talks zero tolerance, zero gardaí on the ground will mean zero justice for rural communities. I want the Minister to take this opportunity to nail fairly and squarely this report and tell us if he will preside over the closure of rural Garda stations. Is the axe hanging over stations with four gardaí? It would explode the Minister's reputation further if this were to happen. I appeal to him to take the opportunity to say that he will not be proceeding in line with the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Timmins and Creed for raising this matter and their leader for zeroing in on me at such short notice. I thank them for the tour of County Wicklow and Cork North-West.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to advise the House that weekend media reports on proposals to close Garda stations are completely without foundation. Far from engaging in cost cutting exercises as suggested in some media reports, I have been a consistent advocate for additional resources for An Garda Síochána. My record as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shows that I do not only talk about additional resources, I deliver them. In the period since I took office the strength of the force has increased consistently. From a base line of 10,800 in 1997 the strength of the force now stands at approximately 11,600 &ndash; the highest it has ever been. By the end of this year it will be close to 11,800 and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by the year 2002. When I took office I inherited a Garda Vote that stood at £472 million. This year the estimate is £698 million &ndash; an increase of £226 million or 48% on that 1997 Estimate. During this time we have seen unprecedented investment to provide the Garda with the best equipment and technology available. These are not the hallmarks of a Minister who engages in cost cutting exercises.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that under the strategic management initiative a fundamental review of all aspects of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána was completed in 1997. The Government appointed a steering group in February 1998 to develop and implement its recommendations. The aim is to position the Garda organisation to respond efficiently and effectively to the challenges it faces in this new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been achieved and new systems of financial management, human resource management, training and promotion have been developed. New approaches to the <Col N="144" /> organisation and deployment of personnel have also been developed through a new rostering framework, a report on civilianisation and a new human resource allocation model. All projects are being developed in full consultation with staff interests.</P>
    <P>The Garda SMI review also recommended a review of the Garda structures, work processes and systems. In December 2000, Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants were recruited to carry out this comprehensive and complex review. Under the terms of reference, the consultants are required to develop the HQ and regional organisation structures, review the HQ specific and core role functions, review the roles of ranks and develop criteria in relation to stations</P>
    <P>In completing the work programme the consultants must evaluate a range of options identified under the SMI programme and make clear recommendations. The consultants will also be required to develop a clear implementation plan. I am advised that in assessing criteria in relation to stations the consultants will be focusing on the best use of Garda resources to deliver a policing service to the community. The consultants will not be recommending the closure of any Garda stations but will be highlighting criteria which could be taken account of in any future assessment of how the functioning or location of Garda stations best serves the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I confirm that there are no proposals in relation to opening or closing of Garda stations. The consultants' review of Garda structures and operating systems which commenced in December 2000 is part of the continuing strategic management initiative in the Garda Síochána. The consultants will not report until August or September this year. Any recommendations in their report will then be considered by the Garda SMI steering group and ultimately by Government. Again, as I said at the outset and contrary to weekend newspaper reports, there are no proposals to close rural Garda stations on the basis of numbers of gardaí or on any other basis.</P>
      <P>If the Government were allowed to ask questions of the Opposition, there would be other matters on the Adjournment tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for raising the important issue of Border security and the need for a new operational Garda station in Muff. There must be proper communications developed in line with the rest of the country. The personnel levels in Border towns should be reviewed, particularly in Inishowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I declare my interest in that I live three miles from Redcastle village, which experienced an incident over the weekend, and 14 miles from the Border crossing at Muff. On a number of occasions I asked the Minister to review personnel levels in Inishowen because of the increase in sporadic petty crime. This weekend's armed raid brings this call to a head.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate that no one was seriously injured although there will be a psychological impact for those put through the ordeal. I wish all involved a speedy recovery. I commend those who ensured that the gang was captured. I do not want to prejudice any case which may be brought but I hope that anyone found guilty will realise that such activity is unacceptable to the people of Redcastle, Inishowen or any part of Donegal. I will not labour the point about this case because, while it is particularly serious, I have other constituents who have endured similar experiences.</P>
    <P>We live beside Derry, a large urban centre with many problems. The bottom line is that whatever the urban problem, the solution invariably involves more financing for individuals or groups which need it. When there are anti-social problems, the solutions are sought in vulnerable regions in the hinterland. On the outskirts of a large centre, we fall victim to the fall-out from the large centre, as was seen last weekend. We gain the social problems of the large town, such as those related to drink, drugs, or violence. A look at the resources Gardaí are given in Donegal will show that the Garda station in Muff has been structurally condemned for the past 20 years. This premises is so appallingly bad that the small personnel level located there reflects its safety level. As the station is located at the gateway into Inishowen, it is appalling that the problems have not been rectified. When serious or even petty crimes have taken place in the recent past in Inishowen, they have often involved gangs and individuals from outside the peninsula. The most popular of the two crossing points used is that at Muff.</P>
    <P>I spoke with commissioner Evans of the Boston police force last week, and he said resources need to be visible and should not be spread thinly. Until we have an appropriate station in Muff, we will not have the personnel, as there is nowhere for them to be safely housed within the existing accommodation and we badly need more personnel. As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue knows, we have a foot and mouth disease patrol on the border at Muff, and yet those who perpetrated the crime at the weekend were not put off. This speaks volumes for the problems of Inishowen with regard to criminal elements from our large urban neighbour.</P>
    <P>The current levels of personnel are not being properly resourced. It is unacceptable that simple and basic communications equipment is not available at Inishowen stations. It is hard to believe that of the 45 stations in the county, only 15 had a fax machine, as at 26 September last. Only 26 had a photocopier and six had a computer with <Col N="146" /> printer. If we are starved of such basic resources I fear to ask about other operational equipment. If a remote station has important written information that has to be brought to the attention of a superintendent or chief superintendent, it cannot be e-mailed or faxed. The only car in the area has to be taken away for most of the day to hand over the information.</P>
    <P>While the Minister does not have direct responsibility for the distribution of such equipment, I sometimes wonder if I would be better off asking the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, or the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for carrier pigeons given the lack of response on this important issue. Gardaí work on a cross-border basis to deal with crime, and are having some success, as was proved by this latest event. They are doing their border duty because of foot and mouth disease, but they need proper facilities, resources and numbers.</P>
    <P>As we saw at the weekend, north Donegal is a vulnerable location. I ask the Minister to give me a positive response in respect of the station at Muff, and the more general needs raised in my contribution. People in my constituency do not want negative publicity. The peninsula has a wonderful recreational and leisure facility to sell. Every cluster of small towns at the edge of a major city experiences social and economic difficulties at the expense of people who choose to live in quiet backwaters. I ask the Minister to help to restore the good name of my constituents and to build security and confidence, which unfortunately are needed, between the large urban centre of Derry and the towns and villages of Inishowen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from Deputy Keaveney's contribution that she is something of a homing pigeon. She has raised this matter consistently, and she has shown a deep interest and commitment to it. She is aware, from my replies to questions in this House, that there were plans to build a new basic unit type station in Muff to support the policing requirements of the area. It was intended to demolish the existing station and construct a new Garda station on the site.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has recently agreed, in principle, purchase terms for the provision of alternative accommodation at a residence a short distance from the station. Subject to confirmation that the title is in order, I expect this accommodation to become available shortly. It will greatly help local Garda in the provision of an efficient and effective policing service in the area. As part of the move to the new location, the question raised by Deputy Keaveney of what facilities and equipment are required, communications and otherwise, will be examined,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister, I am responsible for providing additional Garda personnel and resources; however, their deployment is a matter for the Garda authorities. I am informed that two Gardaí are based at Muff Garda station as well as a <Col N="147" /> Garda on temporary transfer to Muff since 1999. Resources are augmented from within the division as required. Burnfoot Garda station provides 24 hour coverage to Muff sub-district.</P>
    <P>Since I took office the strength of the force has increased consistently starting from a base line of 10,800. The number of Garda by the end of this year will be close on 11,800, which will be the highest in the history of the State. This increase in Garda numbers will continue, because last year, the Government approved my proposals for the recruitment of an additional 500 Gardaí. This latest recruitment will fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the strength of the Force to 12,000, an all-time record <Col N="148" /> high. I am also providing the required financial resources. During my term in office we have seen continued investment being made to equip the Garda with the best equipment and technology available. A record £698 million has been allocated to the Garda vote this year compared to £472 million in 1997, which is an increase of £226 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to the incident referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by Garda authorities that three people were arrested, two in the Republic and one in Northern Ireland. One person has since been charged in this jurisdiction and one person has been charged in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 March 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 50 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The official tourism figures for the year 2000 as compiled by the Central Statistics Office will not be available until the end of this month or early April.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed by Bord Fáilte that preliminary indications suggest that the number of overseas visitors last year will more or less match Government expectations. An increase of 6% to 6.3 million visitors was targeted and the latest forecasts are that the final visitor numbers will come in slightly short of this total.</P>
      <P>The revenue forecast for 2000 of 7% set by Bord Fáilte within the Government target of an average annual increase of 5% over the period of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, is likely to be substantially exceeded. The CSO statistics for the first nine months of last year showed a 20% increase in foreign exchange earnings. This higher than expected performance in revenue earnings appears to be as a result of the relative strength of the dollar and sterling, inflation and increased market share for Irish carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early December I launched the 2001 tourism marketing plans at a formal industry function in Dublin. The plans, which were developed by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the Tourism Marketing Partnership, will involve the largest ever commitment of public and private sector marketing funding amounting in total to approximately <Col N="150" /> £100 million. This funding will enable a series of targeted initiatives to be undertaken across all our major markets, including Britain which was the subject of a major consultancy review commissioned by Bord Fáilte last year. A target of a 5% increase in visitor numbers to 6.6 million and 6% in revenue has been set by Bord Fáilte for 2001.</P>
    <P>While I am in constant contact with Bord Fáilte to ensure that the risk of foot and mouth disease does not jeopardise the medium to long-term prospects of the tourism sector, forecast for tourism numbers for this year will be kept under review in light of the impact of measures to prevent the disease on tourism performance.</P>

In summary, the new company will have responsibility for Tourism Brand Ireland, strategic all-island destination marketing in all markets outside the island of Ireland, international roll out of regional and product marketing programmes formulated by Bord Fáilte, BFE, and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board &ndash; NITB &ndash; and operation of the overseas office network.</P>
      <P>Under the new structural arrangements, Bord Fáilte will continue to have a lead role in product development, setting accommodation standards, product-niche-regional marketing and marketing on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The maximum level of co-operation between Tourism Ireland Limited, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will be facilitated through: the fact that the founder members of TIL are BFE and NITB; the presence on the board of the new company of the chairmen and chief executives of BFE and NITB; a memorandum of understanding agreed between my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland which clarifies the remit of the new company and its relationship with the two tourist boards; and appropriate co-ordination mechanisms at operational level to be agreed between the three parties.</P>

      <P>The Tourist Victim Support Service &ndash; TVSS &ndash; is a service run by the Victim Support organisation since 1994. It is based in Garda headquarters, Harcourt Street, in offices provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is overseen by an advisory board, representative of Victim Support, the TVSS full time co-ordinator, Bord Fáilte, Dublin Corporation, the Irish Hotels Federation, Aer Rianta, the Garda Síochána the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other partners in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide any direct grant aid to TVSS, but the service does receive an annual grant of £15,000 from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent agm of TVSS, it was reported <Col N="152" /> that referrals to the service decreased by 13% in 2000 largely due, it is believed, to the overall decrease in reported crime against tourists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>While ministerial responsibility for the litter issue lies with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have consistently drawn public attention to the fact that litter can have a negative impact on our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte's visitor attitude surveys for 1999 showed a significant increase in the number of overseas visitors mentioning litter as an aspect of an Irish holiday they found to be either unsatisfactory or in need of improvement. Overall, whereas expectations of overseas holidaymakers were either matched or exceeded in over 90% of cases, among the minority for whom their expectations were not met, litter was mentioned by 14%. In his question, Deputy Howlin has referred to a major external consultancy review last year of the British market for holidays in Ireland which was commissioned by Bord Fáilte. This review confirmed the fact that potential tourists to Ireland identify litter as one of Ireland's weaknesses.</P>
      <P>While I understand that the Litter Pollution Act is being implemented in a more proactive fashion by the local authorities, there is clearly need for more intensive action. The tourist industry and I would welcome the stronger enforcement of the Act by local authorities. Reflecting this, I welcome the fact that last month my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a litter action plan. This is a comprehensive national strategy to tackle litter, responding to the report of the National Anti-Litter Forum which he also published. Copies of the plan and report have been circulated to Deputies and are available in the Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 56, 59, 63, 64, 69, 74, 78 and 317 together.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to inform the House that since I last answered questions in the House, further progress has been made on the Sports Campus Ireland project.</P>
      <P>An application for planning permission for the Aquatic and Leisure Centre, which will be known as The Pool at Abbotstown, was lodged with Fingal County Council on 22 December last and permission was granted on 20 February. It is hoped that work will begin in early summer.</P>
      <P>When complete it will encompass a 50 metre swimming pool, 25 metre-diving pool-warm up-training waters, a major leisure water area, spectator facilities for national and international competition.</P>
      <P>The Pool at Abbotstown is intended to provide state of the art swimming facilities for our competitive swimmers and will be a major leisure facility for families and the local communities. The Pool is scheduled for completion by December 2002 in order to be available for the Special Olympics World Summer Games which are being held here in 2003. Its development has been prioritised because of this, but it has been made clear in the architectural and environmental framework plan competition that it has to be integrated into the total site.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure of announcing Behnisch, Behnisch and Partners, the architectural practice responsible for developing the facilities for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, as the winner of an international architectural and environmental framework plan competition, at the offices of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; on Friday, 23 February. The competition which attracted a worldwide entry was set up by CSID to establish how best the overall Sports Campus Ireland site might be developed, to provide first class sporting facilities and to provide a facility for the wider and local communities. The framework plan suggests a logical and coherent approach to the development of the Sports Campus Ireland facilities proposed for the entire Sports Campus Ireland site at Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>The facilities envisaged include the pool, the stadium, the arena, multipurpose halls, a tennis centre, a golf academy, a velodrome, a sports science and medical centre and headquarters for NGBs as well as pitches and playing fields and a 100 acre parkland. Planning permission will be required for all of Sports Campus Ireland. The possibility of using the special development zone method is being discussed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> All facilities on the site have now been put out to tender. The target date for their completion is the end of 2005. The successful consortia will work with Behnisch, Behnisch and Partners to ensure the overall complex is developed in line with the framework plan. Behnisch, Behnisch and Partners will be responsible for the development of all the public spaces and the 100 acres of parkland. With regard to Deputy Rabbitte's question about fees payable to Behnisch, Behnisch and Partners, I would point out that this is a matter for CSID, which is I understand in discussion with the firm on finalising fees.</P>
    <P>CSID has also run a competition to set up an international panel of architects to be called on by the consortia in the creation of the individual buildings such as Stadium Ireland, the indoor arena and the sports science and medical centre etc. This competition again attracted wide interest from many of the world's top architects, including Irish architects, and a panel has been selected.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the need to provide proper infrastructure for Sports Campus Ireland and, importantly, for the greater Blanchardstown area in west Dublin and that the development of Sports Campus Ireland should be a catalyst in finding an acceptable solution to the transport problems in the area. To that end the Government has set up a specialist high level group to look at the public transport needs of the Campus and Blanchardstown in terms of: a metro link from Dublin Airport and the city centre; developing the rail infrastructure on the Maynooth line, which passes close to the Campus and can provide access from the west and the city centre; enhancing bus links and quality bus corridors, and access to the complex by improving road alignments with the M50.</P>
    <P>As plans are developed the high level group will undertake a full consultation process with the local communities. I understand that the chairman of the group has written to the chairperson of Dublin 15 community council asking for their participation in the process. I also understand that CSID too is in discussions with the local community with regard to the impact of the development.</P>
    <P>The cost of the stadium outlined in the original PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study is £230 million. That study also gave an initial guideline cost of £51 million for a campus of sporting excellence. As I explained in the House on 31 January last, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, on the basis of further work carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and professional estimates of the cost of the commercial facilities planned, now estimate the cost of the campus, excluding the stadium, at £320 million, giving a total estimated cost of £550 million. Because CSID has decided to put the project to the market on a public private partnership basis, they estimate that the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for <Col N="156" /> the commercial facilities. When the private donation of £50 million is taken into account, the cost to the Exchequer of Sports Campus Ireland, including Stadium Ireland, is estimated at £350 million. When the tender competitions are over, we will know the value of each contract and will be able to move from &ldquo;best estimates&rdquo; to actual figures which will form the basis for contractual commitments.</P>
    <P>I understand that consultancy costs amounting to £528,885.13 were incurred prior to the establishment of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited. Such costs incurred by the Company since then, £39,500 up to the end of January, or which may be incurred in the future, are a day to day matter for the company. The estimated provision in my Department's Vote for this year for expenditure by CSID is £2 million.</P>
    <P>CSID, as part of its responsibility for the development of the Sports Campus Ireland project, is in discussions with the NGBs with regard to their requirements for use of the facilities at Sports Campus Ireland, including their use of the stadium as a venue for sporting events, and the provision of offices there. The anticipated revenue to be generated by the stadium will be a function of the number of events that take place there.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to Deputy Broughan's question, what I said at the launch of the architectural and environmental framework plan was that in view of the size and scope of Sports Campus Ireland, some experts involved in the preparation of the project have said that when it is complete we will have put in place about three-quarters of the facilities necessary for an Olympic bid. I'm not suggesting that that ought to be the next step, but neither do I believe we should ever allow our sights to be set low.</P>

      <P>The Games Organising Committee &ndash; GOC &ndash; under the chairmanship of Mr. Denis O'Brien, has overall responsibility for the planning, organising, and financing of the games. The GOC has formed a number of sub-committees to address specific tasks and functions associated with delivering a successful games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have approved the provision of up to £8 million in grant support towards the <Col N="157" /> total cost of the games, which is estimated by the GOC at £24.5 million. I understand that the GOC has made good progress in meeting their sponsorship target. £8.25 million has already been committed by Irish companies and the European Union have approved £5 million towards the cost of the games. I understand that an announcement will be made in June outlining further sponsorship arrangements.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of sporting facilities and accommodation, the GOC informs me that it is making good progress. At this stage, all the venues for the games, have been confirmed. The organisers intend to use the Aquatic and Leisure Centre at Abbotstown, as the location for the water-based events which Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited plan to have ready for the games in 2003.</P>
    <P>The GOC will shortly be providing information about a number of programmes associated with the games, such as, the volunteers programme, the host town programme and other programmes in which communities countrywide may participate.</P>

      <P>CERT conducts an employment survey of the four major sectors of the tourism and hospitality industry every year and a more comprehensive survey every three to four years. The CERT Employment Survey 2000, which has just been published, estimates that the total number employed in the four major sectors, hotel, restaurant, guesthouse and licensed premises, is 184,140, which represents an increase of 5% on the numbers employed in 1999.</P>
      <P>The licensed premises sector remains the industry's most significant employer, accounting for over 40% of the workforce in the four sectors. The hotel sector employs almost one third of the workforce, and the restaurant sector accounts for almost a quarter.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that at the time of survey there were approximately 27,750 vacancies across the four sectors at present, 67% of which were in the licensed premises sector. Hotels and restaurants accounted for 14% and 18% of vacancies respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more comprehensive survey, which was completed in respect of 1999, estimated that 246,843 people were employed in the tourism and hospitality industry. As well as the four sectors which I have already mentioned, the figure for 1999 includes 4,580 people employed in the self-catering accommodation sector, 15,221 employed <Col N="158" /> in fast food outlets and 33,910 employed in tourist services and attractions.</P>
    <P>At present, CERT has no firm data on the number of non-nationals working in the industry. However, CERT is in the process of commissioning a research study on The Changing Profile of Tourism Employees to establish the number and location of overseas workers and the training needs of such workers in terms of language, technical and cultural awareness. It is planned to conduct this research during the summer and the findings are expected to be available before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>Growth in tourism over the past ten years has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers doubling to six million and foreign exchange earnings tripling to £2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>I recognise that while all regions have shared in this growth, there has been some significant variations in performance. I can assure the Deputy that it has been one of my top priorities to facilitate a more balanced regional spread of tourism revenue. This is clearly reflected in the strategy outlined in the national development plan which provides over £350 million for tourism marketing, training and product development. Tourism product development measures are located in the new regional operational programmes under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>In the tourism product development measures, in particular, there is a clear focus on widening the spatial spread of tourism and on diverting pressure from highly developed areas. This will be addressed by utilising the potential of the less developed areas through support for the strengthening of special interest facilities, the upgrading and better presentation of a number of clusters of existing attractions and facilities and, in specific circumstances, for the development of some new major attractions. Bord Fáilte's regional marketing programme will complement this strategy, not only through destination promotion but also by measures to attract visitors to particular regions, such as encouragement and support for special niche products that are especially important to the less developed tourism areas.</P>
      <P>However, it cannot be emphasised often enough that successful realisation of the tourism product development strategy which will be embedded in the regional operational programmes is dependent on, and directly linked to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, it is the prerogative of the visitor to determine where he or she spends a holiday. Many factors influence such decisions and the <Col N="159" /> variation in performance in Ireland is due, in no small way, to international industry trends, such as the growth in short breaks and urban tourism.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the review of Ireland's participation in the Sydney Olympics, undertaken on behalf of the Irish Sports Council, was to learn from the experiences of Sydney 2000 and to develop a strategy for the preparations towards Athens 2004. This strategy was based on the analysis of the factual information gathered during the review. The final report is an invaluable and objective analysis of the Sydney experience, which will make an important contribution to our planning for future major events.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to both the steering group appointed by the Irish Sports Council for the dedication and hard work they put in to ensure that the report was delivered to me within such a short space of time and to every organisation and to every individual who co-operated with the steering group. The compilation of the report involved meetings and correspondence with a number of individuals and agencies.</P>
      <P>I urge everybody to focus on the positive aspects of this review and the implementation of recommendations that will have a lasting and beneficial effect on Irish sport. What we must do is focus on the comprehensive recommendations in the report to plan for the future.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the 29 recommendations of the report, the implementation of which can make a real difference to the athletes preparing for Athens 2004, 2008 and beyond. I have asked everyone involved to take these recommendations on board and to work together, in a spirit of generosity and openness, to nurture, support and encourage our emerging and elite talent. It is fair to say that no less is expected by Irish people, who treasure and value sport and who have come to expect that our athletes and teams perform to the very best of their abilities, at the highest level of Olympic and world sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the opinion of the steering group, and I fully endorse this, that the body best placed to <Col N="160" /> oversee the delivery of the strategies and outcomes of this report is the Irish Sports Council, as the body charged with the responsibility for the development of sport. The council is best placed to carry out discussions with the relevant national governing bodies and other interested parties and I understand that the council already has plans in train to begin preparation for that process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received and these will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
      <P>In the assessment of the applications and the allocation of the grants, every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories, while also affording the highest priority to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme provides funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. The national and regional grants are allocated in respect of developments at GAA county grounds, Eircom League grounds, All-Ireland League rugby grounds, and national facilities such as the boxing stadium and Morton Stadium. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities, my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with the relevant national governing bodies, NGBs, of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where appropriate, my Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Departments and with the local authorities in relation <Col N="161" /> to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. In any particular year, the allocation of grants to national and regional facilities, arising particularly from the prioritisation established by the relevant governing bodies of the sports involved, can lead to some apparent distortion of county totals. However, I would expect that in the course of time, the distribution of such grants would be reasonably equitable.</P>
    <P>Last year, for the first time, I introduced a new clause to the programme, by making a minimum of £200,000 available for allocation to each county, subject of course to the requirement that applications for funding from suitable projects, which meet my Department's criteria, have been submitted from each county. I believe this new approach has already, and will in the future, ensure a more equitable spread of funding between counties. There is no doubt that all counties have benefited tremendously from the increased funding I have secured for the sports capital programme. In 1999 I increased funding from £6 million to £20 million and in 2000 I allocated a total of £36 million under the programme to 679 projects throughout the country.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key social inclusion priorities continues to be the need to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities. In this context, the integrated services process &ndash; ISP &ndash; was established on a pilot basis in 1998. It was overseen by a national steering committee and PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed as external evaluators for the process.</P>
      <P>The third progress report on the ISP was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in December 2000. The report highlighted that significant progress has been made to date in improving the co-ordination and targeting of State service provision. This, in turn, has resulted in tangible benefits for the communities concerned and a significant improvement in the services provided by State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also highlighted that implementing the process has placed considerable demands on Departments and agencies in terms of resources. Notwithstanding this, it was found that the pilot phase has demonstrated that the fundamental principles on which the ISP is based are sound and provide a framework through which the State <Col N="162" /> can better deliver its services in the most disadvantaged urban areas. A final report on the integrated services process will be submitted to the Cabinet committee shortly.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Cabinet committee decided that an ISP style framework and approach should be used to establish the new revitalising areas by planning, investment and development programme, RAPID, and will underpin the manner in which it operates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>The successful development of Irish tourism in recent years has created new challenges for the industry, not only in terms of maintaining its competitive position internationally, but also as regards competition for staff in a labour market where skills and shortages have become a major issue for all economic sectors, including tourism.</P>
      <P>This situation requires new and innovative responses from the industry and from the State institutions. For its part CERT, following extensive research and consultation with industry, launched a new strategic plan for the period 2000-06. This is designed to deliver the objectives and programmes set out in the national development plan and involves a shift in the focus of the organisation, with an enhanced emphasis on promoting human resource management capability in the industry, and researching and benchmarking best practice. The industry itself will need smarter recruitment and retention programmes and innovative ways of increasing productivity if it is to maintain its pool of highly motivated, productive and committed skilled labour to respond to market demand for quality service and value for money.</P>
      <P>The Government have agreed to allocate £107 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to CERT to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs in the sector, thereby enhancing the quality of tourism product and service. In this context, over £16 million has been provided in my Departmental estimates for allocation to CERT in 2001 to enable the organisation to commence the implementation of its new strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that CERT has continued with its many initiatives designed to promote careers in the industry to the school leaving population generally. These include workshops for career guidance counsellors, a telephone careers <Col N="163" /> information line, circulation of careers information to over 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries, and youth organisations and the preparation of information packs for industry personnel giving career talks.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, two parallel initiatives are designed to further promote careers in the industry. The first of these, which was launched in October 2000, was CERT's annual careers roadshow, which visited 16 venues country-wide and held over 70 sessions in various second level institutions. It was targeted at second-level students from transition year to leaving certificate level and was implemented in partnership with the major industry bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association. It was widely advertised through local radio stations and newspapers. The second initiative was the launch of the careers magazine <i>Get a Life in Tourism</i>. This magazine is a CERT joint venture with the industry bodies and highlights the variety of careers on offer in the sector. The numbers enrolling in tourism entry courses were maintained for the 2000-01 academic year, despite stiff competition from other industries and educational courses.</P>
    <P>CERT are currently undertaking a pilot programme targeted at long-term unemployment blackspots which has proved to be very popular and successful, with exceptionally good job prospects and participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses. The programme which is currently under way in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchants Quay is to be extended to Waterford during 2001 and will be replicated in other parts of the country which have experienced particularly high levels of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>CERT's new nation-wide programme to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry has been running for nearly a year at this stage. It has proved extremely successful to date and it is projected that 6,000 adults will complete this programme by 2005.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, I understand that tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Scotland and Wales which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. Recruitment drives are currently being considered for other European locations. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, who welcome employers to such recruitment drives. I understand that the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual bodies are also participating in EURES, the European Employment Service, to help satisfy labour shortages in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>To help address concerns in the tourism and hospitality industry in relation to recruitment and staff retention, CERT launched the new RETAIN initiative in the latter part of 2000. <Col N="164" /> Under this initiative, financial assistance of up to £15,000 over a three year period will be available, under certain conditions, to businesses for improvement in human resources management. Alongside the new scheme, CERT will be running a series of courses for owners and general managers on modern human resource best practice.</P>
    <P>In a significant shift in the direction of support for the industry, CERT held a major conference on World Class Service in Tourism and Hospitality for general managers and senior executives in the industry in Dublin Castle in November 2000. Featuring a panel of international speakers and the findings of the latest international research carried out during 2000, the conference focused on best practice in human resources and operations management. It was attended by 150 of the key decision makers from among Ireland's leading tourism industry enterprises.</P>
    <P>One of the key findings to emerge from the report &ldquo;Hospitality Best Practice &ndash; A Benchmark Study&rdquo;, was the requirement for the tourism industry to improve its performance significantly. It emerged from the study that success will only come from focusing on customer needs, and fully engaging employees in meeting those needs.</P>
    <P>In response to these findings, CERT proposes to work more closely with the industry in a number of areas specifically designed to improve operational performance. CERT is planning a number of management development initiatives to assist this process and is working with Excellence Ireland to develop a business excellence recognition scheme to promote the attainment of excellence within the industry and to provide a necessary framework within which management and staff can work towards higher levels of performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>While no specific assessment has been carried out into the level of preparation in the tourism sector for the introduction of the euro, the latest survey by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, which was carried out in December 2000 and which included the hotel and restaurant sectors among those covered by its scope, found that while less than half of all firms still have no formal plans for the changeover to <Col N="165" /> the euro, a substantial majority, 72%, have received information on what is involved in the changeover and have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the information received.</P>
      <P>To address the issue in the tourism industry, CERT has designed and is delivering a series of workshops at regional locations to help tourism operators identify key issues and to develop phased action plans aimed at addressing these. By the end of the February-March period, subject to any foot and mouth restrictions, six workshops will have taken place in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Sligo and Killarney. They are being run for the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Licensed Vintners Federation. CERT estimates that by June, a total of 500 industry personnel will have attended the workshops and that there will be an increase in demand for the programme in the latter half of the year.</P>
      <P>Apart from its own preparations for the introduction of the euro, which include the commencement of staff training in April 2001 and the dual currency display in all print material for 2001, Bord Fáilte has used the opportunity of its regional roadshows to heighten awareness in the industry of the implications of the euro.</P>
      <P>Industry is also playing its part. In September 2001 the Irish Hotels Federation, in conjunction with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, recommended to all members that they should subscribe to the IBEC-EAN Ireland code of practice regarding the changeover. This code, which has been approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs, will provide a framework for self-regulation by the industry with regard to pricing, currency display and conversion and consumer information.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department and the professional associations within the tourism industry are making careful preparations for the introduction of the euro and that they, in co-operation with other organisations such as the Euro Changeover Board, Forfás and IBEC, are doing all possible to exhort and prepare the industry for changeover. It is now up to each individual business to work to ensure it is ready in good time for the changeover.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a recent report on the British holiday market, commissioned by Bord Fáilte, which found a perception that the traditional sense of hospitality and friendliness which tourists expect may be declining; if he plans any moves or initiatives to counter this perception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the findings of the <Col N="166" /> British holiday market report carried out on behalf of Bord Fáilte. The reference to the perception that the traditional sense of hospitality and friendliness which tourists expect may be declining is apparently derived from responses given by tour operators in Britain who programme Ireland.</P>
      <P>While Bord Fáilte's 1999 visitor attitude survey showed some slight diminution in the rating accorded to the friendliness of the people, the ratings are still comparatively high. Nonetheless, I am concerned that, with our recent economic success, some of our traditional appeals such as friendliness and slower pace of life may be perceived by visitors as on the wane. Greater attention on all our parts must be afforded to retaining the traditional Irish welcome.</P>
      <P>As part of the pilot initiative on tourism and the environment under the tourism operational programme, 1994-99, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation pioneered the people and place programme to help sustain the key advantages that Ireland enjoys in terms of its people and unspoiled environment. This initiative, with the objectives of enhancing the awareness of these key elements of our appeal to visitors, included six pilot projects. One of these projects aimed to create a better understanding of the concept of sustainable tourism development by communicating the &ldquo;people and place&rdquo; core values message throughout all tourism sectors, and to selected tourism-related audiences, with a view to facilitating inclusion of the core values in future staff training. The initiative is being continued by ITIC with the support of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatly increased funding for sport provided by this Government over the past three and a half years has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. Funding for capital projects through the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes increased from £12 million in 1997 to £51 million in 2000 and that funding does not include the construction of the national 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick and the development of Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that <Col N="167" /> last year, under the Sports Capital Programme, I allocated £36m to 679 sports and recreational projects right throughout the country, which represents a very substantial improvement on the position which prevailed when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>Special priority is given under the programme to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. In addition, applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and with their local authority before making an application for funding and are also requested to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities, my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the National Governing Bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. Where appropriate my Department also consults with other Government Departments, the local authorities and with the Irish Sports Council, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>In 1999 my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), a consultancy firm specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority swimming pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02, an increase in the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million per annum over these years.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
    <P>Applicants seeking funding for major sports and recreation facilities under my Department's sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes are required to provide a feasibility study setting out detailed assessments on such areas as the types of facilities planned, their potential utilisation, viability, appropriateness to local, regional and national requirements and policy directions and their sustainability over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>In addition to all of this funding, under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional <Col N="168" /> operational programmes of the NDP, a sum of £85 million has been specifically allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-06. These facilities will be located at Gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Local Government. Once the Gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities, and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of Regional Gateways is scheduled for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin. </P>

      <P>The revitalising of areas by planning, investment and development programme, otherwise known as the RAPID programme, will target support and investment to the 25 most deprived areas in the State. The designation of the 25 areas has been agreed by Government on the basis of clear and objective criteria, provided by the Trutz-Haase index, and on an independent analysis of the relative levels of deprivation, which used 11 broad variables drawn from the 1996 census of population and involved 75 separate items of data per district electoral division &ndash; DED. Factors such as unemployment, income levels, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing were taken into account by the Index.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure selection to the 25 most deprived areas, it was necessary to confine the list to those DEDs which fell within the category of &ldquo;the most deprived 5% of DEDs in the State&rdquo; as identified in the Trutz-Haase index. The designation process was supported by data relating to significant incidences of rented local authority housing &ndash; more than 75% &ndash; and by the presence of designated disadvantaged schools as identified by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>Last summer I initiated a comprehensive review of the national drugs strategy to ensure the policies and strategies, which are being pursued, remain relevant to the situation, as it exists on the ground. The objective of the review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to deliver them. It is being overseen by a steering committee known as the review group, which consists of representatives from relevant Departments, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>Some 190 submissions were received from individuals and organisations in response to the public call for submissions. Because of the high level of public interest, I decided to also carry out a thorough and lengthy nation-wide consultation process over the summer months and into autumn. Eight regional consultative fora were held around the country at which more than 600 people took part. I subsequently invited more than 30 agencies and organisations to make detailed presentations to further assist in identification of gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy.</P>
      <P>Since then, and with the assistance of external consultants, drafting of the report of the review has been progressing under the direction of the review group. It is hoped to have the report completed and ready for submission to Government before the end of the month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The local development work of area based partnerships and ADM community groups continues to be supported with funding under the social inclusion and child care sub-programme of the regional operational programmes. This funding amounts to £220 million over the life of the National Development Plan 2000-06. A sum of <Col N="170" /> £122 million has also been provided for the national drugs strategy under the sub-programme for this period.</P>
      <P>The local development measure required that local action plans were drawn up by partnership companies and ADM community groups, in consultation with the director of community and enterprise of the relevant city and county development boards. These plans were submitted to ADM Limited by December 2000 and were evaluated by ADM's appraisal committees for the southern and eastern region, and for the Border, midlands and western region. The allocation of funding for the period 2000-03 has taken place. Allocations are subject to an annual review and the amounts allocated may be increased or decreased on the basis of each groups effectiveness in carrying out their plan.</P>
      <P>In 2000 more than £16 million was drawn down under the new programme. Last year also saw the completion of work under the previous local development programme, OPLURD, which amounted to funding of a further £6 million. A total of £34.5 million has been allocated to ADM for partnerships and community groups to implement their action plans in 2001. Of this amount, £6.8 million has already been drawn down by ADM to cover the first three months of 2001. As the programmes provided for in the plans are only now commencing in some areas this is a satisfactory level of drawdown for the period in question.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs initiative, an amount of over £9 million was drawn down under the NDP in 2000. This amount relates to expenditure under the existing local drugs task force plans. The task forces are currently in the process of submitting their new plans for assessment by the national drugs strategy team. No deadline was set for the submission of up-dated plans in order to give the task forces as much time as they needed to develop new strategies. However, to date, 11 plans have been submitted with the remaining three expected over the coming month or so. Of these, six plans have so far been approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion. Draw down for 2001 will commence as soon as the projects provided for under the approved plans are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been any delay in the allocation of funding for tourism. The national development plan provides for multi-annual budgeting and has allocated some £350 million for tourism marketing, training and product development over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>The productive sector operational programme contains an allocation of £150 million for tourism marketing. Bord Fáilte was allocated almost £15 million for tourism marketing from the operational programme in 2000 and all of this allocation was spent. This year Bord Fáilte has been allocated almost £20 million from the tourism marketing fund and we expect the total allocation to be spent.</P>
      <P>Some £107 million is being allocated to tourism training measures. CERT was allocated £15 million for 2000 and the estimates for 2001 contain a provision of £16 million for current expenditure with an additional provision of £600,000 for capital works. CERT has drawn down their allocation for 2000 and is expected to do likewise for 2001.</P>
      <P>Tourism product development to which £100 million has been allocated over the life of the plan, is within the local enterprise priority of the two regional operational programmes which were approved by the European Commission in December 2000. In line with the requirements of the regional operational programmes, the major components of the tourism product investment scheme have had to be notified to the European Commission for State aids clearance and negotiations are under way. Meanwhile the programme complements were approved by the monitoring committees at their meeting of autumn 2000 and detailed guidelines for project promoters are currently being finalised by Bord Fáilte Éireann, in consultation with my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 79, 329 and 330 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; spreading to this country threatens our economic security and livelihoods, not just those of our farmers and the agriculture and food sec<Col N="173" /> tor, but potentially of virtually every citizen. Agriculture and livestock are of such vital importance to the whole Irish economy that we have to be thorough in our efforts to make sure that the disease does not spread with disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>The implications for our tourism industry, which employs more than 150,000 people and brings more than £3 billion annually into the economy, of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the State would depend on the scale and duration of any outbreak and associated restrictions. If there was a sustained outbreak accompanied by negative international publicity, travel restrictions and prolonged closure of certain key tourism attractions and facilities, it could have a very significant impact on the level of business in 2001 and subsequent year, in particular from the British market which has been one of the main engines of tourism growth in recent years.</P>
    <P>The following initiatives have already been taken within the tourism sector to help reduce the danger of a spread of the disease: all carriers between the two islands are being urged by Bord Fáilte to increase their vigilance and to assist with any further strengthening of protective measures such as disinfectant programmes; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has called for the cancellation of parades throughout the country planned for St. Patrick's Day. The board of the national St. Patrick's Festival Company met on 1 March and decided, in the light of the current serious situation, to postpone this year's festival, including the parade; in response to the call from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the cancellation of all hunting, fishing, hill-walking etc. activity, Bord Fáilte has stepped down and suspended for the time being the promotion of holidays based on such activities in the British market and is reviewing on a case by case basis such promotions in other markets; the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland have asked their members to take preventative measures by, for example, placing disinfectant mats at their entrances; I have asked Bord Fáilte, CERT and the Irish Sports Council to apply appropriate disinfectant procedures at their offices and to cancel non-essential events involving the bringing together of people from farming communities or from infected areas. If such events have to proceed, disinfectant procedures should be used; the Irish Sports Council has written to all of the national governing bodies of sport and has asked them to examine all upcoming events and competitions and to consider any actions necessary to protect the country against the spread of the disease. Already many sporting organisations, including the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI have cancelled fixtures, and I would like to thank them for their co-operation; and Bord Fáilte is making a number of adjustments to their promotional and marketing programmes in response to the current situation, <Col N="174" /> including the rescheduling of inward media and familiarisation visits.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the sense of disappointment in relation to the cancellation of certain events, we may at least consider ourselves fortunate that this situation did not arise in the middle of our peak tourist season in July or August. That is another reason I know everyone involved in tourism is anxious to play a full and active part in the national effort now under way to prevent the spread of the disease. Against that background and the unfortunate but inevitable set-back to our efforts to attract early season tourist business, I can assure the tourism industry that, any promotional drive temporarily stood down will, once we have the all clear, be resumed by Bord Fáilte with renewed vigour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>While most forecasts suggest that the euro should strengthen against the dollar and sterling, the current rate has not appreciated significantly against these currencies compared to this time last year. Other factors such as foot and mouth disease and the slow down in the US economy are more likely to impact on tourism flows than currency movements in the short-term.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I understand from Bord Fáilte that a recent survey suggests that the Irish tourist industry and the hotel sector, in particular, have experienced price increases above the general levels of inflation. At a recent Irish Tourist Industry Confederation dinner, I referred to this worrying trend and underlined the importance of all economic operators taking appropriate measures to maintain and improve competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism marketing plans for 2001, which were launched before Christmas by Bord Fáilte, in conjunction with the Tourism Marketing Partnership, involve the largest ever commitment of State and industry marketing funding, amounting in total to more than £90 million. Decisions taken in the last budget helped boost that figure to approximately £100 million. This funding will enable a series of targeted initiatives to be undertaken across all major markets, including Britain, <Col N="175" /> which was the subject last year of a major consultancy review by Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a member state of the European Union which has a population of some 370 million and a labour force of 171 million. There is free movement of labour within the EU and the wider European Economic Area which includes Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to economic immigration from non-EEA countries is built on facilitating employers' needs to fill job vacancies where it has not been possible to fill them from within Ireland or the EEA, and addressing skills shortages in particular areas. There are no national or sectoral quotas in relation to economic immigration. The State facilitates entry to work in response to applications from employers in respect of specific vacancies.</P>
      <P>The skills of those coming in under the work permit system and the newer working visa-work authorisation arrangements range from the very low skilled to high skilled areas. This is not surprising, given that the latest vacancy survey suggests a vacancy rate of 6.5% or perhaps up to 78,000 vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those coming into the State will also require entry visas and applications for these will be examined by the Department of Foreign <Col N="177" /> Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who will carry out whatever checks they consider necessary in relation to the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>Irish people returning are generally coming back to a job and will usually be familiar with circumstances in the economy and in Irish society. They may also be in receipt of advice and relocation expenses from their new employer.</P>
      <P>With regard to public services, such persons can avail of the information services available to residents from public service providers. For example, there are a number of reliefs under the income tax system available to people coming to live in Ireland for the first time or to Irish citizens returning to live in Ireland having been abroad for a number of years. Information in relation to these is available directly from the Revenue Commissioners or from their website at www.revenue.ie.</P>
      <P>Irish people working in other countries can also obtain details of jobs in Ireland and apply online to suitable jobs by contacting the FÁS website at www.fas.ie. Also available on this site is information on living and working conditions here. More recently, the Jobs Ireland campaign provides extensive information to persons abroad and who are interested in working in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I consider that, at present, one of the main deterrents to people returning to Ireland is the cost of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin area. Relocation costs, costs of rental accommodation and difficulties in commuting to work may also act as disincentives to people returning. This reinforces the need to press ahead with the infrastructural investment element of the NDP, an increased supply of housing, and with the various initiatives now under way such as those in the area of child care.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and the industrial development agencies will continue to <Col N="178" /> encourage more industry to locate to the regions, including non-Objective One areas. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development in the mid-west, have developed regional strategies with a view to achieving balanced regional economic development over the period of the national development plan 2000-06.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has, in conjunction with my Department, set targets for the attraction of a greater number of inward investment projects to regional locations, while Enterprise Ireland has identified significant potential for mobility in terms of expansions among Irish enterprise over the past 12 months. In addition to Enterprise Ireland clients, a sizeable number of large financial and commercial institutions are actively considering operations outside Dublin for their expansion activities.</P>
      <P>From a regional development perspective, the internationally traded services &ndash; ITS &ndash; sector has potential to generate new economic activity in peripheral areas with limited infrastructure. However, this will depend on the availability of high bandwidth telecommunications at competitive costs. Much of the infrastructural support necessary to create an environment where ITS businesses can flourish will be provided through the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The attraction or re-location of industry to regional locations, particularly where unemployment blackspots exist, often depends on the availability of skilled workers in the area and on matching the skills of the local people to the needs of the industry concerned. An example of how the skills issue is being addressed is the Fast Track to IT &ndash; FIT &ndash; initiative, an industry led initiative supported by the Government in the Dublin area at present. This initiative brings together local community organisations, IT companies, State agencies and the unemployed in order to help meet the labour shortages in the IT industry.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the co-ordinated efforts by the development agencies will lead to increased job opportunities in areas of high unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Political agreement was reached by the EU Council of Ministers on 20 December 2000 on the regulation to establish a European Company Statute &ndash; ECS &ndash; and on the related directive concerning worker involvement in European companies. The objective of the ECS, which creates a legal framework for a new form of com<Col N="179" /> pany, is to make it easier for companies to operate across the EU.</P>
      <P>The European Company, known by its Latin name of &ldquo;Societas Europaea&rdquo;, or SE, will give companies operating in more than one member state the option of being established as a single company under a community-based legal framework and so be able to operate throughout the EU with one set of rules and a unified management and reporting system rather than all the different national laws of each member state where they have subsidiaries. For companies active across the internal market the European Company therefore offers the potential of reduced administrative costs and a legal structure adapted to the internal market as a whole.</P>
      <P>Under the European Company Statute, a European company can be set up by the creation of a holding company or a joint subsidiary or by the merger of companies located in at least two member states or by the conversion of an existing company set up under national law. The statute also regulates matters such as minimum capital, management structures and general meetings, but in other areas such as accounting, auditing and winding up defers to the national law applicable to public limited companies, subject to appropriate modifications.</P>
      <P>A separate directive deals with employee involvement and its transposition into national law will govern this aspect for European companies registered in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The hope is that the SE will be attractive for companies seeking an efficient structure to operate on a pan-European basis and that it will enable companies to expand and restructure their cross-border operations without the costly and time consuming red tape of having to set up a network of subsidiaries. It is therefore seen as a step forward in efforts to make the Internal Market a practical reality for business, to encourage more companies to exploit cross-border opportunities and so to boost Europe's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Following the political accord reached by Council, the European Parliament will be consulted on the two amended texts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of days I have held a series of high level meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov in Moscow on 21 February; with French Foreign Minister Vedrine in Paris on 23 February; and with the new US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, in Washington on Wednesday, 28 February.</P>
      <P>These meetings had already been planned before the air attacks in Iraq and the agenda covered a broad range of issues. These included the general situation in the Middle East and recent developments in Iraq, in particular the question of the continuing UN economic sanctions and their humanitarian cost. On Iraq, my objective was to ascertain how thinking is developing in these capitals with a view to identifying what is the most effective role Ireland can play in promoting a forward looking and constructive approach which would address both the humanitarian concern and the key issue of the threat which the Iraqi regime, by refusing to allow the UN verify the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, poses to its neighbours in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my discussions in Moscow, Paris and Washington I outlined the concern of the Government at the suffering being endured by the Iraqi civilian population and at the difficulties arising in the provision of humanitarian assistance as a result of sanctions. I explained the approach which Ireland has taken in the Security Council, that recent developments in Iraq need to be con<Col N="182" /> sidered in the broader context, focusing on the humanitarian aspects and on the need for Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions, especially those relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. I particularly focused on the need to encourage new thinking on how to move beyond the current impasse in the Security Council where the Permanent Five are in dispute on the way forward and to reach agreement on a comprehensive solution as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I was pleased at the welcome given in my meetings to the constructive position adopted by Ireland on the issue. Both Moscow and Paris indicated to me their support for a re-evaluation of the implementation of the current sanctions to take due account of the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. The US Secretary of State briefed me on the visit he had just completed to several Middle East capitals, one of the principal purposes of which was to assess the position in respect of Iraq. He was particularly concerned to contain Iraqi access to weapons of mass destruction, and interested in the possibility of a sanctions regime more focused towards that objective.</P>
    <P>I believe from the outcome of my meetings that there is an emerging view, including on the part of the new US Administration, in favour of examining possible new approaches to the implementation of sanctions.</P>
    <P>The Government support the ongoing efforts of UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to restart a process of dialogue between Iraq and the UN. We welcome the meeting which took place last week between the Secretary General and the Iraqi Foreign Minister. These contacts will resume.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to contribute actively to discussions on this issue in the Security Council and in the sanctions committee. The Government will work to ensure that sufficient progress can be made to permit additional measures to substantially reduce the humanitarian cost of the sanctions.</P>
    <P>It remains the Government's wish to see the lifting of the UN economic sanctions against Iraq altogether. To bring this about it is necessary for Iraq to co-operate with the new United Nations disarmament supervisory commission and to demonstrate with concrete evidence its peaceful intentions, especially with regard to its neighbours. The Government also wish to see full co-operation between Iraq and the UN humanitarian assistance programmes. We remain concerned that the widespread suffering of the Iraqi people has been exacerbated by the apparent withholding of food and medical supplies from the general population by the Iraqi regime and by the diversion of resources to government and military purposes.</P>
    <P>The Government looks forward to the day when Iraq will be able to resume its place in the international community.</P>

At the time of the demonstration the Irish Consulate-General in Edinburgh contacted the Strathclyde police to ascertain whether any Irish citizens had been detained and were informed that all the people arrested had been released without charge.

Contact was also made with the Scottish Justice Department which assured the Consulate-General that the matter would be dealt with thoroughly and urgently and that a full report would be sent to the Consulate-General.

      <P>The EU Common Foreign and Security Policy's human rights working group, COHOM, of which Ireland is an active member, is engaged in developing a position on guidelines on torture.

The guidelines would provide the EU with an operational tool to be used in contacts with third countries at all levels as well as in multilateral human rights fora in order to support and strengthen ongoing efforts to eradicate torture and ill-treatment in all parts of the world. Any guidelines on torture would be used to provide means and methods for achieving the human rights objectives of the EU's foreign policy.

      <P>There are currently 102 applications for road passenger licences under consideration by my Department, only 12 of which are for entirely new routes with no existing bus service. The remaining applications are for routes, which are partly or wholly serviced by existing operators.</P>
      <P>In 2000, 597 licences were issued for a variety of routes and types of services, of which 136 were licences for new routes and the balance, renewals of existing licences. Additional resources have now been recruited and every effort will be made this year to speed up the processing of applications and to increase the number of licences issued in order to improve the availability and range of services available to the public. A number of applications has been received in relation to the licensing round for the greater Dublin area, which closed on 16 February, and it is intended that all of these applications will be processed by the end of April 2001.</P>

As I indicated then, the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the military service allowance, and the consequences for pensioners generally in chapter 22, section 6 of its final report. The commission did not recommend any increase for pensioners in this context.

      <P>At the outset I would like to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU Headline Goal as a &ldquo;Rapid Reaction Force&rdquo;. The response capacity currently being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a Rapid Reaction Force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out Petersberg tasks, tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
      <P> Ireland has a long and distinguished record of involvement in a wide range of UN peacekeeping missions in diverse operating environments. The commitments made in relation to the EU Headline Goal must be seen in the context of continuing Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, I would reiterate that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 40 cows and five heifers under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 31 May 2000. At an inspection carried out on 11 September 2000 it was established that only six of the cows in question had calved in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> The person named informed my Department on 20 February that all animals applied on had been sold. Under the regulations governing the scheme in question the high rate of grant which is £84 per animal is payable on animals that are primarily part of a herd intended for rearing calves intended for meat production. In this case the animals applied on could not be considered to be part of such a herd. It has been decided to treat the animals in question as cull cows. The person named is therefore entitled to payment on up to a maximum of 30 livestock units, eight livestock units at £40 each and 22 livestock units at £33 each, giving a maximum entitlement of £1,046.</P>
    <P>The person in question was written to on 27 February 2001 outlining the decision taken and offering him the opportunity to have this decision reviewed within 21 days by my Department.</P>

While the new area based scheme is now in operation, a compensation package which I negotiated ensures that 90% of losses will be made good this year, reducing to 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss this year will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>

      <P>The Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal considered an application for additional quota from the person named at its meeting on 20 February 2001 but it was not among those for which an allocation was recommended. The person named has been notified of the outcome of his application.

      <P>I understand that the herd which belongs to the person in question underwent the first reactor retest on 27 January 2001, which reported the herd to be clear of infection. The herd is listed for a second reactor retest on 25 March 2001. In the event that this test reports the herd to be clear of infection, the herdowner will have the passports-cattle identity cards returned to him. The person named was paid his full entitlement of £2,063.46 under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme on 22 February 2001. A hardship grant of £200 has been processed and the person in question should receive this payment shortly.</P>

      <P>The calculation of the annual ewe premium is based on a single income loss which is the difference between the basic price and the average EU price. Thus the value of <Col N="193" /> the current premium varies depending on prices prevailing in the EU. A review of the sheepmeat regime was carried out by consultants engaged by the EU Commission and their report issued last autumn. The report identified some weaknesses in the system and the consultants have offered three options for the future development of the regime. These are: (a) the retention of the <i>status quo </i>(b) the correction of inaccuracies in the current system of calculating the premium and (c) the introduction of a fixed premium. The report is still being considered by the Commission, which has indicated that it intends to submit a proposal to the Council to reform the regime, possibly by replacing the variable premium with a fixed premium. However, no proposal to this effect has yet emerged. I have made strong representations to the Commission over the years regarding the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime and, in the event of a Commission proposal for a fixed premium, I will continue to press our case for the premium to be set at the optimum level.</P>

      <P>A total of 9,117 participants are in receipt of pensions under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming. The rate of pension paid under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension. While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three-year scheme of compensation. During 2000, full compensation was paid to all participants in the scheme whose payments had been reduced during 1999.</P>
      <P>On 12 January 2001, the European Commission gave approval for payment of compensation in respect of reductions in payments during 2000. Compensation is set at 75% of the loss incurred. Arrangements for payment are being put in place following receipt of the Commission's approval and the majority of participants who are eligible for the compensation will receive it this month. The compensation scheme provides for a third payment in respect of reductions in payments during 2001, and approval for this payment will be sought from the European Commission in due course.</P>

      <P>Pre-printed area aid application forms and helpsheets for 2001 were issued to some 131,000 farmers last week in order to facilitate their timely completion and return to <Col N="195" /> the area aid unit, so that farmer payments can be made at the earliest possible date. The move from a headage to an area-based compensatory allowance payments system for farmers in less-favoured areas this year will result in an additional administrative workload in the area aid unit. In these circumstances and to facilitate meeting the various commitments set out in the Protocol on Direct Payments to farmers it was decided some time ago to ask farmers to submit their applications earlier this year than in previous years. Neither the issuing of area aid application forms or their return to my Department will have any impact on animal movement whatsoever. Many farmers use the services of Teagasc and other advisers in completing their area aid forms. In order to avoid farmers meeting at such offices, while the threat of foot and mouth disease remains, the closing date for the submission of completed area aid applications was extended by my Department last week from 30 March to 27 April 2001.</P>

      <P>The information requested, as at 26 February 2001, is attached in tabular form. It is understood that a significant number of applications are close to completion by planners. The new REP scheme was launched on 27 November 2000. My Department then began a nationwide series of information meetings for planners to brief them on the new scheme and these meetings were completed by mid-December. A one-day briefing meeting for national and local officers of the farming organisations, covering both REPS and the new early retirement scheme, also took place in mid-December. A nationwide series of information meetings for farmers began in February 2001 but it has been necessary to suspend these meetings as part of my Department's precautions against foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>Full details of the measures employed to implement the food safety aspects of my Department's mission statement are set out in the statement of strategy drawn up by the Department in 1998. These include food safety monitoring, surveillance and inspection programmes at processing plant and farm level, controls on agricultural inputs and support for research into food safety. The aim of these measures is to achieve the highest possible standards of food safety by inculcating a culture of food safety into all aspects of the work of both my Department and its customers. This is in line with the overriding principle that all food producers must bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. With the enactment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation was transferred to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which operates under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. My Department has entered into a service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to carry out certain work in the areas of meat <Col N="197" /> hygiene, milk and milk products, eggs and egg products and pesticide residue controls on behalf of and as agent for the authority.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Debt and Development Coalition of Ireland and the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which operates internationally, have conducted a high profile campaign in favour of the outright cancellation of the unpayable debts of the world's poorest countries. The Irish Government is highly sympathetic to the plight of the heavily indebted poor countries and continues to work for the most generous and flexible application of the HIPC initiative.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am not convinced that a call for total debt relief for all the HIPC countries is feasible in so far as this relates to debt owed to the multilateral financial institutions. The HIPC initiative envisages substantial reductions in bilateral debt and I am heartened by the indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to write off their bilateral debts. At the 2000 annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank I supported calls from my Canadian colleague, Minister Paul Martin, for a moratorium on bilateral debt of qualifying HIPC countries.</P>
      <P>While debt has been a significant constraint for many poor countries it is only one element in the development matrix. We should not lose sight of the broader perspective and of the need to underpin development over as wide a front as possible, particularly at a time when total overseas development aid is being constrained. Ireland has been to the fore in recent times in recommitting to the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the poverty reduction and growth facility, in September 1999 the objectives of the IMF's concessional lending were broadened to include an explicit focus on poverty reduction in the context of a growth oriented strategy. The IMF supports, along with the World Bank, strategies elaborated by the borrowing country in a poverty reduction strategy paper, PRSP, which are prepared with the participation of civil society, including the poor, and other development partners. Reflecting the new objectives and procedures, the IMF established the <Col N="199" /> poverty reduction and growth facility, PRGF, to replace the enhanced structural adjustment facility, ESAF, and this now operates in the broader context referred to above.</P>
    <P>In August 1999, Ireland contributed £2.5 million to the poverty reduction and growth facility. This was the first of a series of payments to the PRGF totalling £7 million; a further £1 million was paid in May 2000 and the remainder will be paid in annual instalments of £0.5 million ending in 2007.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficult situation faced by Zambia where, despite the application of the terms of the heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, repayments on loans taken out during the 1990s and which are due to start in 2001 would have led to an increase in its debt repayments. I have expressed my concern to the Bretton Woods institutions, through the Irish representatives at both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund boards, that Zambia would still face an increase in debt service payments even after receiving full debt relief under the current terms of the initiative. I have stressed that Ireland will support any action necessary to ensure that Zambia's debt service obligations are reduced, and that account be taken of the capacity of Zambia to service debt post-HIPC.</P>
    <P>The International Monetary Fund has now recognised the exceptional circumstances facing Zambia and on 1 December 2000 changed the rules governing IMF assistance under HIPC to permit the fund to accelerate debt relief for Zambia. This action was taken to address a hump in the country's total debt service payments resulting from a significant increase in Zambia's IMF debt service. It will buy some time to more fully address the problem of the hump in debt service.</P>
    <P>As a result of the IMF board's decision and coupled with decisions by other creditors under the HIPC framework, Zambia's debt service payments in each of the years 2001-2003 will now be lower than in 2000. In the absence of HIPC assistance, Zambia's total debt service would have more than doubled in 2001. However, debt relief is not the whole picture. Fresh donor assistance to Zambia is already several times more than debt service. It is expected that overall net transfers to Zambia will rise by about $100 million in 2001, accounting for 15% of GDP. The IMF, too, will put in more than it is taking out.</P>
    <P>The combination of accelerated debt relief and increased aid is expected to allow Zambia to raise social spending from $150 million in 2000 to around $250 million in the 2001 budget. That, more than the precise pattern of debt payments, is what matters most. I will continue to work for the maximum possible degree of generosity to be shown toward Zambia and for the HIPC initiative to be implemented so that it achieves its original objective of giving the countries concerned an exit from the burden of unsustainable debt.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the passenger road service fuel relief scheme. Any operator providing passenger road services within the meaning of section 2 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, enjoys generous tax reliefs under this scheme. The ordinary automotive duty rate on diesel is currently £196.14 per 1,000 litres. Prior to my most recent budget, it was £256.14 per 1,000 litres. Operators benefitting from the fuel relief scheme only pay £17.90 per 1,000 litres. I have no plans to amend this rebated rate of duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The general improvement in the capital allowances regime for plant and machinery which I announced in the budget has benefited buses and coaches. Since 1 January 2001, they are entitled to a 20% per annum straight line write off which means a full write off over five years. This straight line write off is more favourable than a reducing balance system. I have no plans to change this new 20% general capital allowances regime.</P>
      <P>Transport is VAT exempt in Ireland which means that transport operators do not levy VAT on the fares for using their services, but cannot recover any input VAT incurred by them in providing such a service. Exceptionally, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 28) Order, 1996, as amended, provides for relief from VAT in respect of the purchase, hire or lease of tourist coaches of two years or less which are under a certain height and width. It was originally introduced to assist Irish tourist coach operators to compete with their counterparts from other EU countries who have a low or reduced rate of VAT on the transport of passengers which allows them to recover the VAT paid on their coaches. Any extension of this scheme raises important State aid issues where the EU Commission has a deciding role in assessing compatibility of such measures. I doubt that it would approve such measures.</P>
      <P>The extension of this order along the lines suggested by the Deputy would widen the existing scheme significantly and would be in contravention of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. I am not inclined, therefore, to agree to the Deputy's request on extending this order.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 139 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the centre for management and organisation development, CMOD, of my Department set up a central Internet infrastructure to provide Departments and Offices with Internet access and Internet e-mail routing. It also handles e-mail routing between Departments and offices. Although most Departments and offices, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, use this infrastructure, it is entirely voluntary and some Departments and offices have chosen to implement their own separate Internet access and e-mail facilities.</P>
      <P>The CMOD infrastructure consists of links to the Internet, firewalls for security and e-mail routers. Although these are located in Department of Finance buildings they are entirely separate from my Department's computer services and networks and are managed by staff who are not directly involved in the provision of IT facilities for my Department. These staff manage the e-mail routers on an ongoing basis but this is limited to the monitoring of queues of mail between Departments and to and from the Internet at approximately hourly intervals. This monitoring is necessary to ensure that no overloaded queues develop as a result of failures anywhere in the overall e-mail system. No monitoring, copying, replicating or logging of individual mail items takes place. Logs of overall traffic throughput in terms of numbers of mail items handled and their overall size are kept to allow ongoing decisions on capacity requirements to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CMOD infrastructure will be replaced by a virtual private networking facility for the public service, provided by a telecommunications company, later this year. Thereafter, mail routing facilities will not be provided centrally and <Col N="203" /> Departments and offices will have to implement these facilities individually. My Department also sanctions and monitors expenditure from the Houses of the Oireachtas Vote, including expenditure for the provision of IT facilities to the Members of the Houses to facilitate their parliamentary activities.</P>

      <P>Departments are at different stages in the roll-out of Internet access facilities. It is, therefore, to be expected at this time that there will be differences in the Internet and e-mail policy statements adopted for different circumstances. The requirement for a policy statement in this area is relatively new and the content of such statements is evolving. There is significant co-operation among Departments in the drafting of these policy statements which contributes to the content and coverage of the policy statements. My Department will keep this matter under active review to ensure that best practice is applied.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is living abroad and renting property in the State. In cases where rent is paid directly to an individual whose usual place of abode is outside the State, the tenant is obliged to deduct tax at the standard rate, currently 22%, from the payment in accordance with section 1041, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Payment into a bank account in the name of the landlord is regarded as a payment made directly to the landlord. The tenant provides the non-resident landlord with a certificate in respect of the tax deducted. This certificate is provided on form R185.</P>
      <P>Section 1041 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, also provides that the non-resident landlord is entitled to the expenses that are usually allowed in arriving at a rental profit, for example, cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance. The individual may also be entitled to a portion of personal tax credits. These expenses and tax credits are granted on due claim being made. The tax deducted by the tenant is credited against any tax due by the non-resident landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> The non-resident landlord is a chargeable person. Accordingly, the obligations in relation to the filing of an annual return and the payment of preliminary tax apply. The relevant dates, including the revised dates following the change to the calendar year basis, are set out in the appendix. Where rent is paid through an agent to an individual whose usual place of abode is outside the State, the tenant must not deduct tax on payment of the rent to the agent. Instead, the agent is chargeable to income tax in respect of the rent in the same manner as the non-resident landlord would be assessed in his/her own right, that is, after deducting from the rent any allowable expenses and after the granting of the personal tax credits to which the non-resident is entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>On receipt of information from the Irish Medicines Board relating to medeva oral polio vaccine used in Ireland which contained human serum albumin produced from a plasma pool where one of the donors was recently diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, vCJD, I arranged to obtain expert advice from both national and international experts in the field who advised on a wide range of aspects relating to this issue. Their advice indicated that the potential risk, if any, to recipients is essentially non-existent.</P>
      <P>My Department supplied background information, expert risk assessment and other data to health boards and to the Irish College of General Practitioners so that this could be circulated by them to health professionals and others. Each health board was asked to compile a database on the persons who received vaccine from the batches concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19 December I made a public statement on the issue. In conjunction with making public <Col N="208" /> information in this regard, each health board was asked to establish a telephone line which parents could call if they wished to obtain information or to discuss any concerns about their child or children arising from the announcement. This service also enabled reassurance about the level of risk involved to be given to parents. The telephone helplines were in operation from 19 December and there was a high volume of calls to these lines in the days immediately following the announcement. The helplines in most regions were discontinued in early January, as the number of calls being received had declined to a very low level. Persons who still wish to make inquiries can contact the department of public health or the local community care office of their health board. Information is also available on my Department's web site.</P>
    <P>With regard to the persons referred to by the Deputy, I have requested the chief executive officer, South Eastern Health Board, to contact these persons and ensure that they are given as much information, advice and support as possible in relation to this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if he or she is the passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise on up to 600 gallons of fuel for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &ndash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next, and it had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have been considering this proposal in light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has now been decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying tax subsidies, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of £45 per month. I will continue to keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The anti-smoking drug to which the Deputy refers was authorised by the Irish Medicines Board as a prescription-only medicine for use in this country on 23 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the licensing, supervision and control of medicinal products placed on the market in this country. On becoming aware of reported deaths arising from the use of this drug, the board immediately sought information on the matter from its United Kingdom counterpart, the Medicines Control Agency. The Irish Medicines Board remains in close consultation with the agency which is currently reviewing in full all the United Kingdom reports.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board issued a press statement concerning this drug on 21 February 2001. The board advised that initial information from the Medicines Control Agency suggests that, in many cases, the product appears to have been inappropriately used. The agency does not expect to take any regulatory action at present.</P>
      <P>The board reiterated its advice that this medicine should only be used in accordance with the stated recommendations and patient information. Patients were strongly recommended to carefully follow all instructions from health care professionals regarding their treatment, to read carefully any information supplied and to consult their doctor with any problems or uncertainties.</P>
      <P>It is considered that, to date, about 23,000 patients have been treated in Ireland with this drug. The Irish Medicines Board gave specific usage and reporting information on the drug to all registered doctors, dentists and pharmacists in its drug safety newsletter of December last and advised all health care professionals to report all suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of the drug to the board.</P>
      <P>To date, the board has received 65 reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of this product, the majority of which were in keeping with what is expected for the product. It has received notification of three reports of seizure suspected of being associated with the use of the drug and in respect of which further information is awaited by the board. In addition, one report was received of a fatality, but, following a post mortem, this was found to be unrelated to the use of the drug. The board has no evidence of any other long-term sequelae in these patients.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, in association with its European counterparts, continues to monitor the safety of this new medicinal product very closely. It also liaises with the company regarding any new safety issues which arise, and will take any regulatory action considered appropriate.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority is the statutory responsibility of that authority in the first instance. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve the orthodontic services: (i) the appointment of two additional consultant orthodontists is currently in train; (ii) a third consultant orthodontist post has been approved by my Department and the recruitment process is currently under way; (iii) two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress; (iv) interviews to recruit three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards are currently being arranged; (v) interviews for ancillary staff to assist orthodontists will shortly take place; (vi) a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; vii) as part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department also approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The target date for the implementation of the pilot scheme is 1 April this year; (viii) a five surgery unit is being commissioned at St. James's Hospital, equipment has been ordered and will be installed as soon as it is delivered; (ix) the development of a further orthodontic unit at Beaumont hospital is being planned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 November last I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas.</P>
      <P>As part of the initiative, I made funding available for nursing courses in specified specialised areas of clinical practice in order to address the critical shortage of nurses in those areas. In particular, I have provided funding for the establishment of new courses in hospitals outside of Dublin, including the Cork hospitals, and Waterford and Limerick regional hospitals. This is being done in order to arrest the drift of specialist nurses from the acute Dublin hospitals. The availability of new programmes in hospitals around the country will free up places in the Dublin hospitals which can be allocated to Dublin-based nurses.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative nurses or midwives undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. They will also be entitled to have their fees paid in full, in return for a commitment on their part to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year following completion of the course.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are effective from the current academic year and will apply to post-registration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency, critical care, including intensive care, coronary care, burns, peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative does not cover all specialist <Col N="217" /> courses and nurses or midwives undertaking courses not included in this initiative often do so at their own expense. However, the areas included in the initiative have been identified as those where the shortage of specialist nurses is most acute. It is for this reason that I decided to concentrate the resources available to me on those areas. I am keeping the situation under review.</P>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses at an annual cost of some £9 million: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses/midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; and abolition of fees for back-to-practice courses and payment of salary to nurses/midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the £8.5 million which was allocated to the health agencies for continuing nurse education between 1994 and 1999. Individual nurses and midwives who are not eligible for funding under the schemes announced by me may apply to their employers for funding from the separate continuing nurse education budget available to their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health services in individual cases, including the provision of residential care for children with acquired brain injury, is a matter for the health board and I have sent a copy of the Deputy's correspondence to the chief executive officer, Mid-Western Health Board with a <Col N="218" /> request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of services generally to people with acquired brain injury, the degree of sustained disability, as a result of acquired brain injury, is ultimately dictated by the location and severity of the injury to the brain and can range from being mild and, with the assistance of appropriate services, short-term to severe &ndash; requiring ongoing support services or constant nursing care. Accordingly, a range of services is required to meet the differing needs of this client group.</P>
      <P>The need to provide step-down rehabilitation services to deliver on-going therapeutic programmes to individuals with disabilities, including acquired brain injury on discharge from acute hospital care or medical rehabilitation has been identified as a priority service for development. In the case of acquired brain injury, this service will provide the appropriate therapeutic programmes to enable those with cognitive impairment and psycho-social functioning problems to make the transition from hospital to the community. Needless to say, because these conditions are generally acquired in adolescence or early adult years, significant psychological strain is placed on the family and the on-going care and support required by the individual and his or her family needs to be addressed within the community support services.</P>
      <P>There is a need for the provision for specialised units, providing constant nursing care, for some individuals with severe acquired brain injury. Such specialised units would also provide respite care. I have provided just over £92 million under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the development of step-down rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
      <P>From funding made available under the national development plan for mental health services, project teams have been appointed to oversee the planning of five child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric units throughout the country, one such unit to be based at Limerick regional hospital complex for the Mid-Western Health Board region.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, my Department is currently undertaking a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non acute sectors. This review is being undertaken in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. While this review is centred on the acute hospital system, it will also be identifying service requirements within the sub-acute sector, including the need for appropriate rehabilitation and support services. The overriding objective will be to ensure that all individuals are treated in the most appropriate setting. The national bed review will be finalised in April 2001.</P>

      <P>The letter referred to by the Deputy relates largely to concerns over environmental controls on smoking and whether additional prohibitions and restrictions on smoking in certain public areas and facilities will be introduced.</P>
      <P>On Ash Wednesday, 28 February, I announced Government approval for the drafting of a Public Health and Tobacco Bill to give effect to the proposals in the policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, and that the Bill will be given priority in the Government's legislative programme. The provisions of the Bill will include improved protection for people against passive smoking, extension of environmental controls on smoking in public areas and facilities and tougher enforcement provisions.

      <P>In 1999, following lengthy negotiations with the IMO, new one-off arrangements for entry into the GMS scheme by general practitioners were agreed giving entry to the scheme to GPs possessing appropriate qualifications and having necessary experience on the effective date, 1 March 1999, and for five years thereafter. Those one-off provisions sit alongside the established mode of entry through open competition for GMS scheme vacancies created by retirement, death, etc., or recruitment of assistant with a view to partnership.</P>
      <P>The net effect of these measures has been a significant rise in the number of GMS scheme doctors now available to medical card holders and that situation is likely to continue over the next few years as an increasing number of doctors acquire the experience necessary to avail of GMS scheme membership through the one-off arrangements referred to above.</P>
      <P>In the particular case identified by the Deputy, the doctor concerned has not the necessary experience, as per the agreement concluded with the IMO in 1999, to obtain a limited GMS scheme contract. The period of time specified in the agreement to obtain such a contract was five years and that duration was settled on by both my Department and the IMO in order to ensure that GPs holding GMS scheme contracts had the necessary length of service in general practice to provide the level of care associated with the scheme.</P>
      <P>However, in the context of the introduction of automatic eligibility to medical cards for all persons aged 70 years and over the issue raised in the case referred to by the Deputy will be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>My stated objective is to promote, facilitate and provide an appropriate primary care service that is responsive to the needs of patients in a manner that is efficient, effective, economic and equitable. The provision of an appropriate general practitioner out of hours service is an essential aspect of moving forward in this area. The increasing public perception of difficulties in accessing GP services at nights, weekends and public holidays has placed growing and inappropriate pressures on hospitals, especially accident and emergency departments. Accompanying this trend has been a substantial increase in costs for those out of hours GP services that were provided.</P>
      <P>The development of the out-of-hours GP co-operative model is seen by me as an innovative way to progress service delivery and meet patients' needs but it is important that it is capable of being cost-effective too. It is possible that there are other more appropriate models that should also be considered. There are two major GP out of hours co-operative models being piloted in the NEHB and SEHB, Carlow and Kilkenny, areas. They will shortly be subject to a rigorous and independent evaluation and, following that evaluation, decisions can be made on how the concept can be best developed for providing appropriate out of hours GP services to the rest of the country. I fully intend that the evaluation reports will be made publicly available when completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that I have provided funding for each health board in 2001 to facilitate some work on progressing the infrastructural matters surrounding the development of out of hours GP models in their areas with additional funding for the Southern Health Board this year to allow the next major initiative to be undertaken in that board's area. The incremental and structured roll out of an appropriate out of hours service throughout the country is the logical way to proceed and best allows for the proper intro<Col N="223" /> duction of the necessary structures. My Department is also organising a national conference for the end of March, subject to consideration of the foot and mouth disease, involving all the stakeholders, to discuss generally all the issues relating to developing agreed and effective value for money models that provide a proper patient service.</P>

      <P>The national review of bed capacity in the acute and non-acute settings was initiated on foot of a commitment by the Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues last year, as part of the Estimates discussions for 2001, and identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties. I am pleased that funding of £32 million was approved on foot of phase 1 of the review to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period. The investment package has been targeted at a number of areas, including the contracting of private nursing home beds, the provision of aids and supports for use by older people and the recruitment of over 40 additional consultants to the hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these initiatives are being implemented by the various health agencies involved. For example, my Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards that 600 private nursing home beds have been contracted up to the end of February in response to demand. These beds are being contracted for the purpose of providing alternative complementary facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and care in a general hospital and who require short-term care in a more appropriate setting. In relation to the recruitment of additional consultants, I requested of Comhairle na nOspidéal, as the body with statutory responsibility in this area, that these posts be filled initially on a temporary basis, given the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of consultants. In December 2000 Comhairle na nOspidéal approved the appointment of 29 additional accident and emergency consultants and up to 15 <Col N="224" /> additional consultant anaesthetists. The process of recruiting these additional consultants is under way across the various agencies involved.</P>
    <P>The next phase of the national bed review involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review involves a detailed national assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical specialty. This phase of the review will be completed shortly.</P>

      <Col N="225" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I allocated £4.315 million from national cancer strategy funding in the current year to enable the development of centres of excellence to commence in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, Portlaoise General Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Waterford Regional Hospital, University College Hospital Galway and the Southern Health Board area. The development of centres of excellence for the treatment of breast disease will continue over a period of a number of years and will form part of the next phase of implementation of the national cancer strategy. I am committed to providing the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival for those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>In addition to the symptomatic service currently available in acute hospitals, the Deputy may be aware that BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was formally launched on 10 October last. Phase I of the programme will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles Unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion Unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles Unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion Unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford. I am confident that the combined efforts of both these initiatives will have a significant positive impact on the mortality rates from breast cancer.</P>

      <P>A sub-group of the National Cancer Forum reviewed symptomatic breast disease services in this country and submitted a report to me last year. The report entitled, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, contains recommendations regarding the future development of symptomatic breast disease services. Following consideration of the report, I established an advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in the formulation of their plans for the implementation of the recommendations at local level. The advisory group met with representa<Col N="226" /> tives of each health board to explain the rationale behind the recommendations and assist as required.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with the National Cancer Forum, I acknowledged the challenges that are being encountered in implementing the recommendations. I accept that centres of excellence for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease are required in order to ensure the best possible outcome for cancer patients, while acknowledging that the public, medical professionals and politicians need to be apprised of the benefits to be gained from developing these centres. In this context, my Department is considering how the public can be more fully informed about developments in symptomatic breast disease services.</P>

      <P>As part of the recently concluded agreement with non-consultant hospital doctors, it was agreed that, where appropriate, a programme of refurbishment of residences will commence. A joint group comprising of representatives of the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation was established to identify and agree on areas for refurbishment on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency has undertaken a national audit of non-consultant hospital doctor accommodation. This survey found that overall the standard of accommodation is reasonable, with some areas, however, in need of attention. An Irish Medical Organisation questionnaire elicited approximately 23 responses and identified some hospitals where it was claimed that the level of accommodation was not of an acceptable standard. It has been agreed to work through difficulties which arise with the intention of upgrading-refurbishing on-call residences to an acceptable level. A further meeting on these issues between the representatives of health employers and non-consultant hospital doctors is scheduled to take place shortly.</P>

      <P>The introduction of enterprise liability as a <Col N="227" /> replacement for existing indemnity and insurance arrangements in respect of clinical negligence is not intended, of itself, to solve all the problems associated with medical malpractice litigation. Many of the problems which doctors and hospitals confront in this area are shared with organisations and individuals who are affected by the growth in personal injury claims. Thus, any fundamental changes to the legal process through which these claims are processed are a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The introduction of enterprise liability is a necessary solution to problems which are specific to the health service. I hope that enterprise liability would allow for greater use of mediation, arbitration and other dispute resolution procedures, as opposed to litigation.</P>

      <P>In my reply to the Deputy of 21 February 2001 I set out clearly my reasons for my view that the statement issued by the clinicians concerned should be withdrawn. I also stated that they should pursue the issues they raised through effective dialogue and partnership. I also offered to meet representatives of the clinicians concerned. This offer still stands and is in no way inconsistent with the responsibility of the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, to manage and organise the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by the board recently which I welcome. The first is the approval of a proposal from its chief executive and national medical director to appoint a three person committee of international experts of standing in the field of blood transfusion to review the decision on blood testing. The Southern Health Board has been asked to participate in the selection of this committee. The second is the appointment of external management consultants to conduct a review of the implementation of management structures and to include human resource issues. The third is the application to my Department for approval to prepare <Col N="228" /> a design brief for a new transfusion centre in Cork. My Department has given its approval to the IBTS for the immediate establishment of a project team for this purpose. I encourage relevant parties to fully participate in the implementation of these important initiatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency has held a series of meetings with the Irish Medical Organisation in order to resolve the impasse on this important issue. The Irish Medical Organisation had instructed its members not to furnish any information nor participate in testing programmes in the absence of any agreement governing the testing of doctors in this regard and specifically any provision for the retraining, redeployment and compensation for doctors who test positive.</P>
      <P>At the most recent meeting which was held on 8 February 2001, the Health Service Employers Agency put forward a set of proposals which comprehensively addressed the Irish Medical Organisation's concerns. These proposals are underpinned by existing superannuation provisions, the right to recourse to law in pursuit of compensation and the introduction of an innovative medical indemnity scheme. The Irish Medical Organisation was requested to withdraw its instruction to its members, without prejudice to their position, for a period of six weeks to allow for support structures to be put in place for the implementation of the proposals. This approach was not acceptable to the Irish Medical Organisation and further extensive clarification has now been sought on the proposals. The Health Service Employers Agency is readdressing these issues and again seeking the withdrawal of the Irish Medical Organisation's instruction which has potentially serious consequences for both individual doctors and their patients. A significant delay has already arisen in the resolution of this issue and I am most anxious to have these screening protocols introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Under legislation, the issuing of medical cards to eligible persons is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. In making such decisions, chief executive officers have regard,<i> inter alia</i>, to income guidelines, which are adjusted annually in line with the consumer price index as well as to any other individual factors relevant to the decision.</P>
      <P>The decision to give automatic medical card eligibility from 1 July to persons aged 70 years and over was a logical consequence of the three year doubling of income limits for that age group begun in March 1999 and concluding in March of this year. The position in relation to the categories of persons referred to by the Deputy is that their medical card eligibility will continue to be assessed in the normal manner and I am satisfied that the situation regarding those groups is capable of being appropriately dealt with under the current eligibility arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. The health board chief executives have indicated the review will be concluded by mid-year. I understand that the area of income guidelines will form part of the review.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services for persons living in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The improvement of accident and emergency services has been identified as a priority matter for the authority and it has established a dedicated team to review accident and emergency services in the region. From this review the authority intends to put forward a comprehensive policy for accident and emergency services which it expects will overcome many of the problems currently being experienced.</P>
      <P>The authority will be seeking to redress any imbalance in emergency care in terms of access, timeliness, appropriateness and quality. In particular, the review will examine issues such as the physical and human resource requirements to reduce waiting times for treatment and admission in accident and emergency departments. The review will also seek to improve emergency access to treatment through a detailed examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It will also consider the provision of alternative care options for persons presenting with minor injuries. These options will include general practitioner out of hours services in community or hospital settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> My Department is committed to ensuring that hospitals, including the Mater Hospital, are in a position to respond to the need for their services, particularly during periods of peak demand. In recent years the Department has allocated significant additional funding to hospitals, particularly in the eastern region, to enable them to continue to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing difficulties experienced in their accident and emergency departments. These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions, the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>At a national level my Department has initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The interim findings of the review have been presented to Government and a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors have been identified. Arising from the review, my Department provided funding of £9.49 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period 2000-01.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a joint program of work aimed at modernising the civil registration service is being undertaken by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department which will involve a review <Col N="232" /> of the entire registration system, including registration law and the structure of registration on a national basis, in order to identify the changes necessary to capitalise on the use of modern technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration in a modern, efficient and legally adequate system. It is the intention that the system will incorporate a link to all life events associated with each person. The Deputy may also be aware from answers to previous questions in relation to registration issues of the project to capture records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country by improving the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes. It will also provide potential for the development of a range of services which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to bringing Ireland into line with other EU-EEA states where such controls exist in one form or another, improving standards in existing pharmacies and promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the free movement of pharmacists directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with <Col N="235" /> the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is proactive in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licencing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which, <i>inter alia, </i>the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and this is being undertaken as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

      <P>The product referred to by the Deputy is now being dispensed in a pack of 28 tablets, which are in blisters, with the pack containing a patient information leaflet. This method of dispensing is a direct result of a European directive which changed the method of dispensing from a bulk pack to a dispensing patient pack. This directive made it a requirement that all prescriptions must be supplied with a label and a patient information leaflet. The manufacturers of the product concerned have confirmed that, in the main, the increase in price is due to the cost of packaging materials and labour. The product is included in the common list of reimbursable items for both the general medical services and drug payment schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the GMS scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price of the drug plus a dispensing fee. In the case of private prescriptions reimbursed under the drug payment scheme, the cost reimbursed by the State covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost, normally 50% of the trade price, and a standard dispensing fee. My Department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing, which has been established by custom and practice over the years.</P>

      <P>Before any patient is referred abroad for treatment a health board must ensure that the following procedures are adhered to: the application to refer a patient abroad must be assessed before that patient goes abroad except in cases of extreme urgency; medical evidence must be provided by a hospital consultant giving details of the condition from which the patient suffers and of the type of treatment envisaged and it must be certified by the consultant that the treatment concerned is not available in this country; there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; there is a reasonable medical prognosis; the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment and is recommended by the patient's consultant and the treatment is to be carried out in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have no obligation to meet any part of the cost involved where arrangements are made to send a patient abroad to a non-EU country or arrangements are made privately for the <Col N="241" /> treatment of a patient in any country abroad. However, in exceptional circumstances, a health board may consider that a contribution towards the cost of a service provided abroad would be justified. It is a matter for the health board to examine the circumstances of each individual case and to determine the financial contribution to be made.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the programme in question related to cardiac surgery for children and I indicated that, in instances where there were staffing and capacity problems in this country, as an interim measure, funding would be provided to allow children to go abroad for such operations subject to proper sanction and agreement with clinical involvement. My statement was obviously in the context of the discussion at the time and the criteria mentioned above.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board recently brought the attention of my Department to the case referred to by the Deputy. My Department has confirmed that the chief executive officer of the board has the discretion to consider and approve cases for referral abroad subject to the procedures set down for assessing such cases.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Long stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical card holders are exempt from these charges, and are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services <Col N="242" /> including consultants services. In practice, however, persons in health board long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 to 221, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 13 December 2000 the Irish Medicines Board informed my Department that a constituent of the oral polio vaccine, namely human serum albumin, HSA, utilised a blood donation in its manufacture from a UK resident who has recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfelt Jakob Disease vCJD. On receipt of the information I arranged to obtain expert advice from both national and international experts in the field, who advised on a wide range of aspects relating to this issue. Their advice indicated that the potential risk, if any, to recipients is essentially non-existent.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with making the public information in this regard, each health board was asked to establish a telephone line which parents could call if they wished to obtain information or to discuss any concerns about their children, arising from the announcement. This service also enabled reassurance to be given to parents about the level of risk involved. The telephone helplines were in operation from 19 December and there was a high volume of calls to these lines in the days immediately following the announcement. The helplines in most regions were discontinued in early January, as the number of calls being received had declined to a very low level.</P>
      <P>Health boards were requested to have immunisation records examined in order to establish the extent of usage of the vaccine batches concerned. In the course of this examination, information came to light which suggested that vaccine from the batches concerned was administered after its expiry date. Health boards were also requested to establish the extent to which this occurred. To date, responses have been received from five health boards, which indicate that, in four health boards 4,225 doses were administered out of date. In the fifth board, 295 children received out of date vaccine. Children receive three doses of oral polio vaccine as part of their primary immunisation and one booster dose at school entry age. In any 12 month period, some 100,000 children would receive primary and booster polio immunisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought expert advice in relation to the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases. My Department wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards, advising them that parents of any children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date, should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were also asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation. It is not possible at this stage to indicate the <Col N="244" /> number of children who have been re-vaccinated. This information has been requested from the health boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>The M4 motorway opened early in 1994. The NRA was established with effect from 1 January 1994 and assumed responsibility for all national roads from that date. Issues connected with the flooding of the M4 are accordingly a matter for the NRA to address, in co-operation with the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An annual block grant is provided by my Department to the NRA which has responsibility for the funding and programming of individual projects. My Department provided grant aid to Kildare County Council for the design and construction of the M4 in a number of years preceding the establishment of the NRA. In this connec<Col N="246" /> tion, I am satisfied that the motorway drainage systems were designed in accordance with accepted practice and standards.</P>
    <P>The overall project consisted of approximately 17.6 km of dual carriageway motorway by-passing the towns of Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip and involved the construction of 11 bridges, including a major crossing over the River Liffey. The overall project cost was £63 million. Normal procedures were followed in advancing the construction of the road.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo; places a strong emphasis on the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle in financing the provision of waste services by or on behalf of local authorities and advocates the introduction of weight related charging to the fullest extent possible. In the context of the provision of segregated collection services to households, there is scope for charging mechanisms whereby a household could receive credit in relation to the amount of organic or dry recyclable waste properly segregated for collection, to be offset against any charge levied in respect of residual waste requiring disposal. Such charging mechanisms would provide a direct incentive for householders to maximise waste prevention and the diversion of waste from disposal.</P>

The authorities are responsible for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and bridges in their areas, funding for which is provided from their own resources, supplemented by State grants. These funds are designed to cover contingencies arising from flooding, etc. The provision of funding for national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority which has statutory responsibility for the management of the national road network, including the allocation of grants.</P>
      <P>My Department's water services investment programme funds water supply and sewerage infrastructure schemes needed for economic and environmental purposes. These schemes do not extend to flood relief generally but drainage requirements of urban catchments can be assisted. The Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing flood relief measures.</P>

      <P>The most recent statutory assessment of housing needs, which was undertaken in March 1999, indicated that there were 5,234 homeless persons. The 1999 assessment of the number of homeless persons was based on a much broader <Col N="249" /> definition of homeless persons than the assessment undertaken in 1996 and includes those with no accommodation, those in hostels and in health board accommodation and those staying with friends. Some would be staying in temporary accommodation with family or friends until suitable accommodation becomes available. In 1996, the assessment indicated that there were 2,501 homeless persons. My Department does not have information on the number of homeless persons for 1997 and 1998. The next statutory assessment of housing needs, including the number of homeless persons, will take place in March next year.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, envisages a penalty points system as a key measure in support of road safety enforcement. The Government approved the drafting of legislation necessary for this measure in July 2000. The design of the system has, as anticipated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. The drafting of the Bill is now being finalised and I expect it to be published very soon. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year.</P>
      <P>The preparation of an Irish penalty points system has involved study of comparable systems operating in many other states, including the systems operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both from a legal and organisational perspective.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 832 to 834, inclusive, on 30 January 2001, the Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government does not propose at this stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers. Instead, the safe use of mobile phones by drivers was to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry. In line with this policy, the National Safety Council has issued an advisory leaflet, sponsored by Esat, for the safe use of mobile phones by drivers. In another initiative, a leaflet has been issued by Eircell and the Automobile Association, in association with Esso.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific prohibition, use of mobile phones which causes a driver to act in a manner which could be regarded as dangerous or careless, may be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, recognises that road factors contribute to some 25% of all accidents. Engineering measures are, therefore, an appropriate response to these cases and are an important element in the road safety strategy. In 1996, my Department published a <i>Guide to Road Safety Engineering in Ireland</i>, which has been circulated to all road authorities and is used by the NRA. The main purpose of the guide is to explain how accidents can be reduced by introducing low cost road engineering measures. Training courses in the use of this manual, and the treatment of high accident locations, have been developed by the NRA for local authorities.</P>
      <P>The NRA programme of low cost remedial accident countermeasures, is showing huge success. A recent formal assessment of the impact of the first two years of this programme shows a reduction of six fatal accidents and nine serious injury accidents each year since the works were carried out, with a benefit cost ratio of nearly 6 to 1.</P>
      <P>A similar programme of low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads was introduced for the first time in 2000. Some 55 locations on non-national roads were approved for funding last year. The allocations for 2001 provide £1.8 million for similar works this year in what will be a much more extensive programme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, the accelerated implementation of the national roads development programme, as provided for in the NDP, will also have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing road accident levels. Improved road infrastructure, to which this Government has made a major commitment, will undoubtedly assist in reducing road fatalities and injuries. However, achievement of the targets set in the road safety strategy will also require a continuing improvement in road user behaviour in the areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International experience shows that reductions in road accident fatalities and injuries can be most quickly achieved by targeting human behaviour, particularly in the key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing. It is logical that the strategy should prioritise those three areas which <Col N="253" /> are calculated to deliver 72% of the total reduction in fatalities which we are targeting.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240, 252 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, which were made on 21 November 2000, provide a revised basis for taxi licensing. It has not been practicable to provide for a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term, given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, in recognition of the need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi has been fixed at £100, with a £5,000 fee for ordinary taxi licences. Furthermore, I have put on record my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible. I do not have any current proposals to extend this requirement to hackneys.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns in relation to the current specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi. I have indicated that it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, disabled persons, taxi service providers and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the service providers and the general public alike, in the medium term. These may include, if appropriate, further improvements of the existing specification for wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No grants are available from my Department at present for the installation of global positioning systems. My Department has previously supported the commissioning by Dublin Corporation of a consultancy study on the feasibility of a cen<Col N="254" /> tralised taxi booking service for Dublin, which was undertaken last year. It is expected that further consideration of the merits of global positioning systems will arise in the context of the consultation process outlined above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 to 244, inclusive, and Question No. 257 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to the introduction by the Revenue Commissioners of a levy on the supply of plastic shopping bags. This measure requires primary legislation and appropriate provision &ndash; which will also enable the application of a levy to be extended to other articles &ndash; will be made in the forthcoming Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which will be published shortly. It is my intention to implement the levy as soon as possible this year.</P>
      <P>The detailed modalities relating to the implementation, collection and enforcement of the proposed levy are currently being finalised. The specific types of plastic shopping bag to be subject to levy will be specified in due course in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the proposed measure is to directly influence consumer behaviour and <Col N="255" /> achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets, because of their significance as a highly visible component of litter. It will be open to customers to utilise reusable bags or other containers for shopping purposes and thereby avoid exposure to the proposed levy. In this regard, I have highlighted the desirability of utilising reusable shopping bags as part of a specific initiative on environmentally friendly shopping under the ongoing national environmental awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in ongoing consultations with the Revenue Commissioners as well as with representatives of manufacturers, distributors and relevant retail groups in relation to the introduction of the levy. Account has been taken of the implementation mechanisms adopted in other jurisdictions, such as Denmark and Italy, where similar type levies have previously been introduced, in the formulation of a suitable implementation strategy here. The net revenues generated by the proposed levy will be hypothecated to a dedicated environment fund for use in support of appropriate anti-litter, waste management and other environmental initiatives.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to comment on the actions that might be taken by a local authority and or the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in any hypothetical case of apparent illegal waste activity.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 59(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible generally for the supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, to take measures directly to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity. However, the 1996 Act also provides that nothing in section 59(1) shall be construed as prejudicing the right of the EPA to perform any functions conferred on it under any provision of the Act.</P>

      <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their area is a matter for local authorities, to be funded from their own resources, supplemented by State grants. I recently announced non-national road allocations of £6.633 million for Leitrim County Council for 2001, an increase of 14% on the council's 2000 allocation and 50% on the 1997 allocation. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be assisted from the various non-national road grant categories &ndash; mainly discretionary grants, restoration grants and specific improvement grants &ndash; is a matter for the local authority and neither I nor my Department has any function in the matter.</P>
      <P>Leitrim County Council submitted nine applications to the Department for funding in 2001, totalling £2 million under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme. The council was allocated funding of £1.81 million in 2001 for seven projects, including £300,000 for the R280-Killargue. Funding was not sought for any other part of the R280 in 2001.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced non-national road grant funding of more than £319 million for local authorities in 2001. South Dublin County Council's allocation <Col N="258" /> for 2001 is more than £5.698 million, which is a 26% increase on the council's 2000 allocation and a 55% increase on the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>The council submitted four applications for funding in 2001 under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme, including an application for funding of £1 million towards work on the green route from Ballyboden Road to Grange Road. This application, together with all other applications under this scheme, was considered in my Department, having regard to compliance with the eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2001. In the event, this project was not among the projects totalling £1.735 million which were selected from South Dublin County Council's submission for advancement in 2001, under the scheme. It remains open to the council to fund this project from its own resources or to submit it for funding in 2002 when my Department seeks applications from local authorities later this year.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, establish a revised regime for taxi licensing. The regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which shall be granted by local licensing authorities, and revoke all earlier restrictions of this kind.

In addition, it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>

      <P>Paper constitutes the main recyclable waste generated by my Department. All such waste generated in the Department's headquarters in the Custom House and in its Shannon office is directed to recycling outlets. In the case of the Department's office in Ballina, it is estimated that about 75% of such waste is currently recycled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff restaurant in the Custom House, in the normal course of events, would be the source of most other waste. However, the restaurant was specifically established and is operated with a view to minimising such waste and no use is made of cans, bottles or disposable cutlery. The residue of organic waste arising is directed to dedicated compost bins on the grounds of the Custom House. The Department is in the process of preparing an application for certification to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard for its offices at the Custom House, Dublin. This entails developing a waste management strategy for the prevention, reduction, re-use, recycling, collection, separation, storage and disposal of all <Col N="260" /> waste arising in the building. As part of this process, targets will be set to reduce the volume of waste generated on the premises and to increase the volume of such waste that is recycled.</P>
    <P>ENFO, the Environmental Information Service, in 17 St. Andrew Street currently operates a waste segregation system which facilitates the separation of waste paper, organic material, and plastic/glass for recycling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative framework through which restrictions and prohibitions may be applied to the parking of vehicles generally on public roads is contained in sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. Regulations made under section 35, entitled the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 and 1998, set out the specific range of controls that apply to the parking of vehicles. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána or local authority appointed traffic wardens. The imposition of prohibitions or restrictions on parking on particular public roads is a matter in the first instance for individual road authorities through the provision of appropriate traffic signs or roadway markings. I have no current proposals for new legislation on this matter.</P>
      <P>In addition, section 32 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, gives powers to local authorities to deal with instances of illegal encampments by Travellers. The administrative procedures to be taken under the Act involves a notice being served by the local authority to remove the temporary dwelling followed by the towing away of the dwelling if there is no response to the notice within a specified period of time.</P>
      <P>There are other powers available to local authorities to deal with problems in this area. For example, under the Planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development and under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas. Local authority powers to make by-laws in relation to the use of temporary dwellings under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, have been strengthened under the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>

These directives are fully implemented in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The EU high level group on road safety has identified the fitting of speed limiters to light commercial vehicles as a priority; proposals for a directive on this subject are presently under development in the European Commission. In addition, the Commission is carrying out research into the use of speed limiters in all vehicles. In line with the commitment in the Government strategy on road safety, Ireland will continue to support strongly the development and introduction of new vehicle safety measures at EU level and will press for their implementation at the earliest possible dates.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to <Col N="262" /> the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
      <P>A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. Details of the income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>There are special conditions in place which allow people participating in an approved employment scheme to retain their entitlement to the BSCF allowance as long as their household income is less than £250 per week. Under the scheme an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that I have established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well as the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I expect to have the working group's report in the near future.</P>
      <P>The BSCF allowance is not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with clothing needs. There is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment to people in certain circumstances who have special clothing needs. An application for exceptional needs payments, which are payable at the discretion of the health board, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 13 February 2001 at the rate of £137.70 per week. He became unfit for work from 6 February 2001 and claimed disability benefit.</P>
      <P>In accordance with social welfare legislation the weekly rate of disability benefit payable depends on the level of earnings a claimant had in the governing contribution year. In order to qualify for payment at the maximum rate a claimant is required to have reckonable average weekly earnings of £70 or more in the governing contribution year. A claimant with no reckonable earnings in the governing contribution year is deemed to have average weekly earnings of £25 and qualifies for a reduced payment of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned qualified for disability benefit at the weekly rate of £78.50. The reduction in payment can only be made good through a &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and the person concerned should contact the community welfare officer in this regard at his local health centre. Payments made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are subject to a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Historically, most public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover. This arose as it was viewed that such employees had provision within the terms and conditions of their public sector employments for adequate cover for contingencies such as sickness or old age and that the risk of unemployment was not a factor in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government announced its intention in 1994 to extend full PRSI coverage to all public sector employees. However, following extensive consultation with staff interests full PRSI coverage was only extended to new entrants to the public service in 1995 with consequent changes in the occupational arrangements. The employees referred to by the Deputy continue to pay the modified rate of social insurance which applies to <Col N="264" /> most public servants and this does not give coverage for old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to give those paying only the modified rate of insurance access to the OACP scheme. However, in recent years a number of measures have been introduced which is making it easier for those with mixed insurance records to receive a payment.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements were introduced for old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; and retirement pension purposes in 1991 to cater for people with a mixture of full and modified rate PRSI. The revised arrangements provide for the payment of pro-rata pensions in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the class A rate. In 1997, the yearly average required for a minimum pension was reduced to ten contributions. More recently, I introduced a special flat-rate old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to benefit people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. I understand that former public servants are one of the groups benefiting from these measures. The policy in relation to the terms and conditions of public sector employment is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The £6 weekly means disregard which applies in the case of non-contributory pensions and certain other social assistance allowances was originally introduced at a time when almost all income and capital was assessed for means test purposes. However, over the years various income-earnings disregards have been introduced for many of these payments. For instance, under the carer's allowance scheme, there is a weekly income disregard of £75 for a single person and £150 in the case of a couple. These disregards are increasing to £125 and £250 respectively, from April. In addition, in the case of the old age &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; pensioner couples, all means are assessed at 50%.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have also been introduced in the operation of the arrangements for assessing capital, including the introduction of a substantial £10,000 disregard &ndash; £20,000 in the case of old age pensioner couples &ndash; of capital for means test purposes from October last year. In the light of these improvements, there is little justification in increasing the separate means disregard. I would see the further enhancement of the various income/earnings disregards as the best approach to improving the operation of the means test in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no register available which details the number of married women who work full time in the home and have applied for a social welfare payment. Existing supports under the social welfare system for those who work full-time in the home are as follows. Child benefit generally is payable to the mother, recognising the important value of the work done by the primary carer, who is usually the mother. With effect from next June, a full three months earlier than usual, child benefit rates for first and second children will increase by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. That constitutes a full year investment of £330 million and marks the first step in a three year programme of increases which will see Government investment in the child benefit scheme rise by an additional £1 billion by 2003.</P>
      <P>This three year investment package will strengthen the position of those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way, while simultaneously easing the burden for those who opt to go out to work and utilise childcare facilities. The dedication of substantial resources to child benefit in budget 2001 reflects the serious commitment this Government has made to supporting those who are responsible for raising our children.</P>
      <P>In relation to pensions, I am also strongly committed to improving the position of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives. Measures already introduced, including the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the extra recognition afforded to pre-1953 contributions, are making it easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a pension. In addition, under the homemaker's scheme, years spent out of the workforce caring for children or incapacitated people may be disregarded when calculating entitlement to old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; or retirement pension. The scheme is currently effective from 1994 and a maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, I announced improvements in the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age which will see this increasing to the full old age pension rate over a number of budgets. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full rate QAA. Following on the report of the PPF working group, which is currently examining the issues surrounding administrative individualisation, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While recognising that the social insurance sys<Col N="267" /> tem cannot cover all gaps in pension coverage, nevertheless, as I indicated in budget 2001 speech, more needs to be done in this area. In particular I am committed in principle to making the existing homemaker's scheme effective from an earlier date than 1994 and replacing the disregards system with actual credits. These and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications involved, will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions which commenced recently.</P>

Last year it received a total of 8,300 planning and development referrals and <Col N="271" /> where it makes such recommendations it then becomes a matter for the planning authority to determine the application under planning and development law. In view of the large number of applications referred to the Department it would not be practicable, without a considerable amount of work, to say, in respect of each referral, whether my Department made a submission to the respective planning authority and to summarise such individual submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 209 on 29 June 2000 and Question No. 206 on 14 December 2000 in this regard.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. 94 of 1997) specifies procedures in respect of the manner of notification of candidate special areas of conservation. Every effort is made to locate the address, and to notify in writing every occupier-owner of land in a proposed special area of conservation. Such notification includes details of compensation arrangements and appeals mechanisms and a description and a detailed map of the site.</P>
      <P>Advertisements appear in the local press detailing the townlands affected by the designations, together with contact names and telephone numbers of conservation rangers who may be contacted for further clarification. Maps of the proposed SACs are displayed in one or more local Garda stations, local authority offices and local offices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have undertaken a number of initiatives, additional to the notification requirements pre<Col N="272" /> scribed in the regulations, with a view to further facilitating communication and dialogue with interested parties.</P>
    <P>I have provided an opportunity to landowners and land users to have their objections examined informally by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I have also established an appeals advisory board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, comprising of equal representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations to assess appeals independently and to advise me on these matters.</P>
    <P>I have also provided a freefone service to provide further explanation to interested parties and a website at www.heritagedata.ie. This website provides access to datasets in relation to SACs and provides a site description of the 362 candidate sites transmitted to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The only long-term practical way of ensuring the conservation of wildlife areas is through the co-operation of landowners. I have requested landowners and land users to establish local liaison committees for each site. These committees will be consulted and kept fully informed by officials of my Department about matters relating to the conservation and management of the sites in question. Meetings of such committees have been suspended in the short-term, however, in the current foot and mouth disease emergency.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as more than 14,000 landowners have been individually notified in writing in respect of 362 candidate special areas of conservation, it would not be practical to list them all and place details on the public record. In addition, I must respect people's right to privacy. However, if the Deputy requires assistance in relation to particular landowners, I would be happy to provide whatever information is available to me.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 354 dated 27 February 2001 in relation to the criteria for selecting sites for designation as candidate special areas of conservation, cSAC, and natural heritage areas, NHA.</P>
      <P>The habitats directive requires member states to propose areas for designation as SAC's and to protect their favourable conservation status. Article 4(1) of the directive requires member states to propose a list of sites for SAC designation based on the scientific criteria set out at annex III of the directive. To date, Ireland has transmitted 362 sites as candidate special areas of conservation to the EU Commission. The EU Commission has yet to adopt any special area of conservation as a site of community importance, for any member state. I may not formally designate any of the sites until after such adoption has occurred.</P>
      <P>The process for designating SAC's in Ireland is set out in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, particularly Regulations 3,4,5,8,9 and 10. The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, provides for the first time a statutory basis for designating NHAs. The process is set out in sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Registrar of Titles states that this refers to an application under a Land Commission Schedule which was lodged on 3 November 1987. Land Commission Schedules are deemed to be registered as of the date of vesting which is prior to the date of lodgment of the documents in the Land Registry. Accordingly, registration in the Land Registry of Land Commission cases is afforded a lower priority than the registration of other dealings. Due to the complicated nature of the application, it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that the application is receiving attention.</P>

      <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000, prohibits discrimination in connection with the provision of services to the public generally on any of the following grounds &ndash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a golf club is a commercial undertaking, the Act prohibits it from treating a person less favourably than another person on any of the grounds listed above. If, however, a golf club is a private registered club within the meaning of the Registration of Clubs Acts, the Act seeks to discourage such discrimination by allowing a com<Col N="275" /> plainant to apply for a determination from the District Court that the club is a discriminating club. On first finding that the club is a discriminating club, the court may suspend the club's right to sell alcoholic drink to its members for up to 30 days. On subsequent finding, the club may lose that right indefinitely. No other sanction against a discriminating private registered club, such as withdrawal of State grant, is provided for in the Act.</P>
    <P>It might be of help to the Deputy to know that some, but not all, grants of public funds paid to clubs have terms and conditions which require grantees to produce evidence of non-discrimination and give a written undertaking that the facility will be made available to the local community. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he might raise it with the relevant grant aiding public body.</P>

      <P>Children born in Ireland to non-Irish national parents are Irish citizens and have the same citizenship rights as other Irish citizens. In line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case, subject to the common good, a non-Irish national who becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State with that citizen. In examining such applications, my Department has regard to the finding that an Irish citizen is entitled to the care and company of its parents in the State, even if those parents have no other entitlement to reside here, subject to the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system for births is a matter for the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. I understand that the details to be recorded in the Register of Births are set out in legislation and do not include the nationality of the parent(s) nor the purpose of their migration to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department records certain statistics in relation to applications for permission to remain from non-Irish nationals on the basis that they are the parents of an Irish citizen. The number of current or former asylum applicants granted permission to remain on this basis in 1996 and 1997 was 142 and 107, respectively. Figures are not available for those years in respect of persons <Col N="276" /> other than current or former asylum applicants. No applications for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen were processed during 1998, as the basis for granting such permission was under review at that time. This review was completed in July, 1999, and processing recommenced from that date. In 1999, 1,428 persons were granted permission to remain on this basis, of whom 1,227 were current or former asylum seekers. The corresponding figures for 2000 are 1,515 and 909, respectively.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that when the Deputy refers to refugees he means asylum seekers. The directorate for asylum support services which is responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers has to date sourced 75 accommodation centres throughout the State. The directorate entered into a memorandum of agreement with each proprietor-manager which sets out comprehensively the standards required, including a standard of care, for the operation of the centre. The directorate conducts regular inspections to ensure that these standards are met and if breaches are discovered in the course of these inspections urgent remedial action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directorate is very conscious of the invaluable work undertaken by volunteers in the local reception of asylum seekers. It recently hosted a conference entitled &ldquo;Meeting the Needs of Volunteers and Asylum Seekers&rdquo; to recognise and highlight the work of volunteers. The directorate <Col N="279" /> assists and supports volunteers on an ongoing basis by providing information, answering queries, arranging meetings and organising seminars to exchange information and ideas. The directorate organised a visit in September 2000 by the senior liaison officer with UNHCR to accommodation centres where she met and discussed asylum issues with local volunteers. Directorate officials are always on hand to assist volunteers. An information pack including country of origin material, procedures on processing claims, rights and entitlements of asylum seekers, etc., is provided to volunteers.</P>
    <P>All asylum seekers are provided with information leaflets when applying for asylum at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner &ndash; RAC. The information leaflet sets out in detail the rights and obligations of asylum seekers along with a step by step guide to the process. The leaflet notifies the applicant of their entitlement to contact the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the address of the local office is provided. The information leaflet and the questionnaire provided at the initial application is available in 24 different languages. Applicants are required to return the questionnaire &ndash; which forms the basis of the claim for asylum &ndash; within five working days and may submit further information-documentation at any time up to seven working days after their interview which, as a general rule is not arranged for at least three weeks following the initial application being made. If an applicant indicates that they wish to submit medical evidence in support of their claim, allowance will be made to enable such evidence to be submitted having regard to the time frame set out in the legislation. All interviews under sections 11 and 12 of the Refugee Act, as amended, are conducted with the aid of an interpreter where necessary and possible.</P>
    <P>A separate information leaflet is also provided at the time of initial application on behalf of the refugee legal service which explains the nature of the service. Where there is a complete language barrier, the services of an interpreter are employed to assist with communication during the initial application process. In the case of unaccompanied minors, a social worker of the relevant health board must be present during the initial application process if the health board deems it in the best interests of the child to make an application for asylum.</P>
    <P>There is no secretarial service provided by the RAC to asylum applicants or refugees, in the context of examination of applications for family reunification referred to under section 18 of the Refugee Act to contact their homes for documentation. The timeframe allowed in regard to the provision of submissions is laid down in the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, and the RAC has no discretion with regard to variation of those timeframes. The time limits for submission of appeals to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal against the recommendation of the RAC are statute <Col N="280" /> based and the RAT therefore has no discretion to grant an extension of time in any circumstances. A separate information leaflet on the entire appeals process has been prepared and is available to applicants.</P>
    <P>As regards medical screening, this service is offered to asylum seekers during their initial stay in Dublin. Arrangements are also in place for all health boards to offer the service again to asylum seekers who are resettled where they have not availed of the service in Dublin. Screening is done in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children and covers diseases such as TB, hepatitis and polio. The vaccination status of each individual is also examined. The guidelines do not preclude other investigations deemed necessary on clinical or public health grounds. Depending on the availability of facilities, screening may be carried out at the accommodation centre or in the local health centre. Asylum seekers invariably qualify for a medical card on income grounds and have access to health services on the same basis as medical card holders generally. Where, on medical advice, there are special dietary needs, arrangements can be made with the management of the accommodation facilities to ensure that these are catered for.</P>

Details in relation to the State as a whole are not readily available. The Garda states that car seizures are spread equally throughout the Dublin 1 area and that no one particular area experiences any more problems than others.

      <P>The person referred to arrived in the State on 3 January 2000 and sought asylum. Following an interview, her case was deemed to be manifestly unfounded on 28 April 2000. She was informed in writing that she had <Col N="281" /> seven working days to appeal this decision. No consideration was given to her subsequent appeal because it was not made within the required time frame </P>
      <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the person in question was informed on 5 September 2000 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was given the options of making representations within 15 days, leaving the State before the order was made or consenting to the making of the deportation order. Further to that correspondence, the refugee legal service submitted various grounds on which the person referred to should be granted leave to remain in the State. Having considered the case file in the light of the relevant statutory provisions, I signed a deportation order in respect of the person referred to on 8 November 2000.</P>
      <P>The person referred to has since been given leave by the courts to seek a judicial review of her deportation. In the circumstances it is not appropriate for me to take further action in this matter until the judicial review is determined.</P>

      <P>I announced last November that a total of £12 million would be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-02. Tenders will soon issue for the provision of town centre CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The planning, including the consultation process, for the location and operation of Garda CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford will commence later this year with the objective of having the systems installed and operational in 2002.</P>
      <P>While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature of them and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee, estab<Col N="282" /> lished by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority and plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda must be allowed access to the system as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon. CCTV cameras have already been provided in Dublin city centre &ndash; North Central and South Central &ndash; and in Tralee. A CCTV system comprising of 29 cameras is currently being installed in Cork city with completion expected later on this year.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Firearms Act, 1925, provides for the revocation of a firearm certificate by the superintendent of the district in which the holder of the firearm certificate resides when he or she is satisfied that the holder of such certificate has no good reason for requiring the firearm to which the certificate relates or is a person who cannot, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his or her possession, or is a person who is declared by the Act to be disentitled to hold a firearm certificate, or where the firearm certificate limits the purposes for which the firearm to which it relates may be used, is using such firearm for purposes not authorised by the certificate.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Firearms Act, 1925, as amended, provides for the surrendering of the firearm to the superintendent and also for the disposal of the firearm, following the revocation of the firearm certificate.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities follow the following procedures when deciding to revoke a firearm certificate &ndash; the superintendent must make known his or her reasons to the person concerned at the time of revocation. Sufficient detail of all the superintendent's reasons for deciding to revoke the firearm certificate should be made known to the person.

These patrols consist of uniformed members backed up by personnel from the detective units, the divisional crime task force and the divisional drugs unit who constantly target the area and known offenders so as to allay the fears of the local community. The local community Garda maintains regular contact both formally and informally with community groups to ensure that their needs are met.</P>
      <P>The most prevalent problems encountered by the gardaí in Ringsend Park, which is open 24 hours a day, relate to cases of criminal damage to trees, the painting of graffiti and the drinking of alcohol by youths who congregate within the park particularly at night time and weekends. Discussions have taken place with corporation officials who are to provide special locks for all of the gates of the park with a view to limiting access to the park at night time. The Garda continues to enforce the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Corporation of Dublin intoxicating liquor bye-laws with a view to improving the situation.</P>

      <P>Shortly after the Government decided in 1998 to establish the committee to review the Offences Against the State Acts, the atrocity at Omagh took place. Subsequently, as the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas enacted the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. This led to an extension of the remit of the committee, to cover the 1998 Act, and an amendment of its terms of reference, requesting it to report as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of the review is extensive and complex, and of compelling public importance, covering as it does legislation which has been central to the response by the State to terrorism and subversion. I do not believe that the time so far taken by the committee could be characterised as a delay in this context. It is far more important that the review be carried out thoroughly and comprehensively, rather than that it be done quickly. In any event, I understand that the committee expects to finalise its report and submit it to me within a relatively short time.</P>

      <P>Section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, is under examination by the committee established by the Government to review the Offences against the State Acts. The committee, which I understand expects to finalise its report and submit it to me in a relatively short time, will no doubt take into account the findings of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases referred to in any recommendations it may make on section 52.</P>

The criteria used at present are being formally reviewed by my Department. This review is being carried out in consultation with the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. The directorate has entered into contracts for the provision of full board accommodation for asylum seekers with proprietors and managers throughout the State. The directorate requires that proprietors and managers must comply with all statutory charges and levies and must supply an original current tax clearance certificate. Payments made under the terms of these contracts are at all times conditional on the proprietor or manager being in possession of a current valid tax clearance certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the policing of tax incentive schemes is a matter for the revenue commissioners. The Department of Finance has indicated to my Department that the use of accommodation to house asylum seekers does <Col N="287" /> not,<i> per se</i>, affect companies' status for BES purposes.</P>

In addition all relevant information in relation to the prisoner, such as a recent photograph, last known address, next of kin, name of victim, etc. is also passed to the Garda.</P>
      <P>Each case is assessed based on its individual circumstances and an appropriate response is put in place by An Garda Síochána. It is, as I have indicated in the House before, an operational matter and as such it is for the Garda authorities to consider whether the public is considered to be at risk and what is the best strategy to pursue in returning the prisoner to custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, schemes for capital and staffing grants for community or not for profit groups are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme 2000 to 2006 which was announced on 28 April 2000.</P>
      <P>A completed application form for a staffing grant for a playgroup was received in the equal opportunities childcare section of my Department on 19 February 2001 from the Newpark Close resource centre. I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities childcare section that the application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 19 February 2001. A technical assessment of this application will be carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee. Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the staffing application for the playgroup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, that an application for funding was made by Newpark Close resource centre in September 2000 under the out of school hours scheme operated by that Department. This application for staffing costs was considered by the out of school hours assess<Col N="291" /> ment group and in November 2000 the centre was advised that their application had not been recommended for funding. The centre was notified of a number of issues that should be addressed if the centre were considering re-applying for out of school hours funding.</P>
    <P>An application was resubmitted to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in December 2000. The centre was advised by that Department in January 2001 that the administration procedures for the grant scheme for 2001 had not been decided and that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs did not have a timescale for the assessment of this new application for funding.</P>
    <P>To support a more integrated and co-ordinated approach to childcare service provision, arrangements are being finalised for the transfer of responsibility of certain childcare grant schemes, including the out of school hours scheme, to my Department. Once these arrangements have been completed, my Department will be in contact with all groups who have made an application to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under this scheme.</P>

      <P>Grant allocations under the 2000 sports capital programme operated by my Department were announced last July. Among the conditions of the grants allocated were that all relevant documentation must be submitted to and approved by my Department and that a substantial amount of the work had to be completed to facilitate the drawing down of the grant by 28 September 2001. A full picture on the drawing down of grants allocated in 2000 will not be available until after that date. However should these conditions not be met by any of the grantees, my Department retains the right to withdraw the grant after the relevant date. In view of the considerable commitments already made under the programme any such funds withdrawn reduce the overall level of commitments under the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>Sports capital funding was first introduced in the early 1970s and up to 1998 all applications on hand were taken into consideration each time grant allocations were made. Grants allocated prior to 1998 were made by the Department of Education and Science. Under the 1998 programme, about 1,700 applications then on hand were considered for funding and grants were allocated to 246 projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme were revised following a review of sports capital funding carried out in 1998. One of the recommendations of this review was that applicants were required to submit an application in respect of each year in which they sought funding and this procedure was introduced as and from the 1999 programme. Under the 1999 sports capital programme, 1,897 applications were received, of which 416 were successful and 1,481 were unsuccessful. Under the 2000 programme, <Col N="295" /> 1,645 applications were received, of which 679 were successful and 966 were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Under the sports capital programme from 1998 to 2000, the number of projects funded has increased by 176% from 246 to 679; the amount of funding allocated has increased by 500% from £5,950,000 to £35,831,700 and the average grant increased by over 120% from just over £24,000 to almost £53,000. The 2001 sports capital programme was advertised in the national press on 15 and 17 December 2000. The closing date for receipt of application forms was Friday, 9 February 2001. In excess of 1,450 applications have been received for the programme, all of which will be evaluated in accordance with the assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is attached in the following tabular statement. It should be noted that the scheme is administered on a county and not on a constituency basis. Blank entries in the amount requested column indicate that the applicants in question did not specify the amount of funding they requested on the application form. Blank entries in the amount allocated field indicate that the applicants were not allocated grants under the programme.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, grants totalling £36 million were allocated to 679 projects throughout the country in 2000. The grantees have until 28 September 2001 to submit the necessary documentation and draw down the grant. A number of these projects have already submitted the <Col N="343" /> necessary documentation and work on the projects is under way. The grants in these cases will paid on receipt of the certificate of payment or invoices.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 sports capital programme, grants totalling £20 million were allocated to 416 projects. The grantees had until 30 September 2000 to draw down the grant. A substantial number of these projects have been completed while some are still ongoing. My Department is currently contacting the organisations whose projects have not yet commenced or who have not yet submitted any of the required documentation, advising them that the grants are about to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Under the 1998 sports capital programme, grants totalling £6 million were allocated to 246 projects. The grantees had until 30 June 1999 to draw down grants. The majority of these grants have now been paid while a small number are still ongoing. Any projects which have not commenced or which have failed to supply the necessary documentation have now been withdrawn by my Department. Under the terms of the programme, projects cannot proceed until all of the necessary documentation is received in my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that in view of the large number of projects (in excess of 1,300) which were allocated grants during the years in question, it is not practicable to furnish details on each individual case. However, if the Deputy wishes to enquire about any specific case, I will be pleased to provide any appropriate information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the commitments made in November 1999 review of the action programme for the millennium was to &ldquo;maintain substantial investment in the development of environmentally sustainable tourism products which promote year-round tourism.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan 2000/06, I secured over £350 million for the development of tourism. Investment will be focused on developing environmentally sustainable tourism products while also encouraging off-peak and niche tourism. These moneys will be spread across a number of operational programmes (OPs), such as the productive sector OP (£150 million for tourism marketing), employment and human resources development OP (just over £100m. for tourism training) and regional OPs for the BMW and SE regions (£100 million in total for product development).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> On the marketing side, the focus will be to facilitate the creation of a marketing strategy that can spread visitor numbers over time and help generate better regional spread thereby helping to reduce environmental pressures resulting from seasonal and regional over-concentration of tourism. On the tourism product side, environmental sustainability will be one of the key selection criteria. Before being approved for grant aid, applicants will be required to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the independent product management board, that statutory planning and environmental requirements are adhered to, and the environmental sustainability of the project, having regard to best practice in relation to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the tourism product investment scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions share of overseas tourism revenue. The scheme will include a specific measure to promote the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment, with a particular focus on the implementation of integrated tourism management plans in established tourism areas.</P>
    <P>In terms of achievements in this area to date, I would point to one of the key objectives of the operational programme for tourism 1994-99, to achieve more new growth outside the peak July and August period; and to the fact that the percentage of overseas tourists to Ireland during the peak period dropped from 30% in 1993 to under 27% in 1999, while the percentage of those who visited during the off-peak period increased from 40% to 43%, over the same timescale.</P>
    <P>While lead responsibility for environmental matters rests with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the special pilot scheme on tourism and the environment in 1998. The objective of the pilot was to generate practical projects that addressed issues where tourism and the environment interface.</P>
    <P>From a total of 120 applications, 22 projects were approved, covering issues such as visitor and traffic management, training and awareness raising, area based tourism plans, carrying capacity analyses and innovative litter control actions. The projects have all now been completed. The pilot initiative addressed immediate problems in some existing key tourism pressure points and achieved practical results. It also encouraged innovative thinking in relation to managing the tourism environment and provided useful learning points that have mainstream potential. Following completion and evaluation of the pilot initiative, I have made it clear to the local authorities that, in my view, lead responsibility for mainstreaming the lessons learned rests with them. Environment is at the heart of our attraction as a tourist destination. Our reputation for unspoilt beauty is an important appeal in the international tourism market and the onus is on us to ensure that future <Col N="345" /> investment is concentrated in environmentally and financially sustainable tourism products.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of the tourism product investment scheme &ndash; to be funded from the £100 million within the tourism measures of the regional operational programmes &ndash; is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue. Under sub-measure 1 &ndash; major attractors and clusters of existing attractions &ndash; investment will be concentrated in up to eleven major new day-visitor attractions, each capable of attracting over 100,000 visitors a year, strategically located in areas where none currently exist and which are capable, environmentally and economically, of supporting such attractions.</P>
      <P>The scheme also plans to upgrade and improve packaging of a further eleven identified, geographically coherent and financially sustainable, clusters of existing attractions including, where necessary, support for investment in some new projects identified as essential for the completion of such clusters. In line with the regional OP, this scheme has had to be notified to the European Commission as a State aid and negotiations are under way. Meanwhile detailed guidelines for project promoters are being finalised by Bord Fáilte, in consultation with my Department.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling £12.9 million were paid to local authorities towards the refurbishment of existing pools and the construction of new pools during the period 1998-2000 inclusive. The total cost of these projects ranged from £30,000 to £5.8 million, depending on the level of works undertaken.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), who are consultants specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. I then secured a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme for the period 2000-02, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over these years.</P>
      <P>My Department has also committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick. Construction of this pool is under way and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is proposed to provide a major new aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown as part of the facilities at Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

      <P>The most important initiatives to <Col N="347" /> support the continued development of the tourism industry are contained in the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The plan provides for public support in excess of £350 million for tourism marketing, product development and training initiatives over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>Operational programmes incorporating details of the initiatives and programmes proposed for marketing, £150 million, training, £107 million, and product development, £100 million, have been agreed and are being progressively rolled out.</P>
      <P>Another important initiative is the establishment at the end of last year of the new all-island tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited, within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement. The formation of this new company, which will market the whole island as a tourism destination abroad, is one of the most significant institutional changes in the delivery of tourism policy since Bord Fáilte was set up in the early 1950s.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333, 334 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1994, the Irish tourism industry has benefited from major investment programmes with the number of hotels increasing by 182 or 27% and the number of bedrooms by 15,636 or 64%. As of March 2001, there are 851 registered hotels with 40,008 bedrooms. In addition, some further 26 new hotels with 2,303 bedrooms are scheduled <Col N="348" /> to open in 2001. There are 22 hotels in County Kildare with 573 bedrooms.</P>
    <P>The provincial breakdown of the current hotel numbers is as follows: Ulster &ndash; the three counties within the Republic &ndash; has 78 hotels or 9% with 2,802 bedrooms or 7%; Munster has 300 hotels or 35% with 14,427 bedrooms of 36%; Leinster has 304 hotels or 36% with 16,856 bedrooms or 42%; and Connacht has 169 hotels or 20% with 5,923 bedrooms or 15%.</P>
    <P>Latest available figures on room occupancy average for the country stand at 66% &ndash; from January to September 2000 &ndash; indicating that, along with new hotels under construction or in the pipeline, our accommodation bank should be sufficient to meet expected growth in hotel demand over the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have increased the allocation of capital funding for the provision of sport and recreational facilities under the sports capital programme from £6 million in 1998 to £36 million in 2000, an increase of 500%, and the sport of athletics has benefited in a very significant way under this increased funding.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme provides funding to clubs and organisations at local, regional and national level for the provision of sports and recreational facilities. Under the programme, funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received with special priority being given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
      <P>Prior to making allocations under the programme, my Department consults, as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 2000 sports capital programme, 679 clubs and organisations around the country were allocated grants amounting to £36 million. Of this total, more than £5.8 million was allocated specifically to the sport of athletics, including grants of £4.8 million towards the provision of a new state of the art indoor athletics facility for Morton Stadium, Santry, £500,000 towards the refurbishment of the track and other ancillary facilities at Ringsend Park, Irishtown, and <Col N="349" /> £100,000 towards ongoing development of the An Ríocht Athletic Track, Castleisland. A list of the athletic clubs funded under the 1999 and 2000 sport capital programmes follows.</P>
    <P>The 2001 programme was advertised in December 2001 and the closing date for the receipt of applications was 9 February 2001. In excess of 1,450 applications were received and these will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions which accompanied the application forms. I hope to be in a position to announce the 2001 round of the grant allocations as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed and I anticipate that there will be a number of athletic facilities among the projects being funded.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, grants totalling £36 million were allocated to 679 projects throughout the country in 2000, including £2,001,500 for 29 projects in County Kildare. The grantees have until 28 September 2001 to submit the necessary documentation and draw down the grant. A number of these projects have already submitted the necessary documentation and work on the projects is under way. The grants in these cases will be paid on receipt of the certificate of payment or invoices.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 sports capital programme, grants totalling £20 million were allocated to 416 projects, including £1,981,000 for 21 projects in County Kildare. The grantees had until 30 September 2000 to draw down the grant. A substantial number of these projects have been completed while some are still ongoing. My Department is currently contacting the organisations whose projects have not yet commenced or who have not yet submitted any of the required documentation advising them that the grants are about to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Under the 1998 sports capital programme, grants totalling £6 million were allocated to 246 projects, including £1,085,000 for 32 projects in County Kildare. The grantees had until 30 June 1999 to draw down grants. The majority of these grants have now been paid while a small number are still ongoing.</P>
      <P>During the course of the year 2000, grants amounting to over £1 million were withdrawn from projects which did not commence on time or which failed to submit the necessary documentation to my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, I secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000-02 for the refurbishment of existing pools and provision of new pools. The package effectively increased the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million. Grants totalling £6.5 million were allocated towards the refurbishment of Roscommon pool and construction of new pools in Dundalk and Courtown, County Wexford during 2000. Work is in progress on these pools.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were invited to submit proposals and a total of 51 such proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000. Decisions have been made on five of these applications and there are 46 proposals from local authorities under consideration at present, including two for County Kildare for pools in Naas and Athy.</P>
      <P>My Department has also committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the national 50-metre swimming pool in Limerick. Construction of this pool is under way and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the extent to which co-operation exists between his Department and the Department of Education and Science in the matter of the provision of sporting and recreational facilities in schools and colleges for joint use by students and the general public; the number and location of such jointly funded or operated facilities at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6917/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities in schools and colleges is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme operated by my Department provides funding to clubs and organisations at local, regional and national level for the provision of sports and recreational facilities. Under the programme, funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received, with special priority being given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, applications from schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must provide for significant levels of usage by the local community during periods when the facilities are not being used by the school itself  &ndash; at least 30 hours per week throughout the year, and demonstrate that the facilities concerned will meet an identified deficiency in that locality, as formally agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to the identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and-or duplication of existing facilities.</P>
      <P>During the course of the assessment of applications received under the sports capital programme my Department consults, as appropriate, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level. Prior to making any allocations to schools and colleges, my Department consults with the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science to establish the plans, if any, it might have for the provision of sporting facilities in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2000 programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of applications was 11 February 2000. A total of 1,645 applications was received and evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions which accompanied the <Col N="353" /> application forms. I announced the bulk of the grant allocations in July, 2000.</P>
    <P>As applications to the programme are categorised on the basis of the sports which they represent rather than whether an educational establishment is involved in the application, I am not in a position to state the number and location of such jointly funded or operated facilities. A list of all of the projects funded under the 2000 sports capital programme is available on my Department's web site at the address www.irlgov.ie\tourism-sport.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the payment of an additional £25 per week training bonus to some but not all of participants in the vocational training opportunities scheme is a source of divisiveness; the reason the same level of funding is not made available to all participants in this scheme, irrespective of time on unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1999, a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. at least 12 months unemployed. This allowance was later approved for eligible VTOS participants, including those on a one-parent family payment and those in receipt of a disability payment who have been in receipt of their respective payment for at least 12 months also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of those hardest to reach, i.e. long-term unemployed people, in education and training programmes. The effect of the incentive in prioritising access for the long-term unemployed would be dissipated if the bonus were applied equally to all participants.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say at this point when construction will commence as the rate of progress to construction of a major project such as this depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project; the time required to undertake architectural planning; the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit; the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a tire certificate; the availability of funding; the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement where relevant of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
      <P>The school authorities will be kept informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and post-leaving certificate students, which are administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible.</P>
      <P>My Department also meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees provision, financial support is also available to third level students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies.</P>
      <P>These financial supports are available to all eligible students, including those who are returning to full-time education having been unemployed. However, while there is no specific provision towards the cost of child-care under the schemes of student support, consideration can be given to meeting such costs under the student assistance-access fund, at the discretion of the third level institutions.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme operated by my Department, and the back to education allowance schemes, operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, enable adults over 21, who are at least six months unemployed, to return to full-time education while retaining a welfare payment or training allowance. The White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, also proposes arrangements under which part-time adult education opportunities will be expanded and fee relief given to those who are unemployed, medical card holders, means-tested welfare recipients, or family income supplement recipients or their dependants.</P>
      <P>Participants on VTOS availing of full-time further education may benefit from additional supports towards child care. Funds are paid by my Department to vocational education committees towards the cost of direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches, and payment of childminders, subject to tax compliance, registration as required with the health boards, a maximum of £50 per child per week for full sessional care, and pro-rata adjustments for part time sessions.</P>

      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710 respectively.</P>
      <P>A postgraduate grant holder is also eligible to have his or her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
      <P>Last October, I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year 2000-01.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently 542 temporary, unqualified teachers teaching in primary schools. This information is not available for specific postal districts in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. This has arisen because of two main factors: the Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating extra posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage and the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level, for example, 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post graduate course will commence early this year with a proposed intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish Language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000 teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. The employment of teachers in second level schools is a matter, in the first instance, for the authorities of the schools concerned. My <Col N="362" /> Department does not have details of the number of unqualified teachers employed in such schools.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy already benefits from inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme. By virtue of its inclusion in that scheme, the school has been allocated a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post and the services of a shared home-school-community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched on 4 January last, will run over three years and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to more than 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme and the school in question has been included in the rural dimension. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £1,064 towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. Rural schools with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage have been allocated the services of a teacher-co-ordinator who will work <Col N="363" /> in clusters of four or five schools. However, certain schools in this group, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are isolated from other similar schools and it was not possible to include them in a cluster. In such cases, these schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher-co-ordinator support.</P>
    <P>Individual schools which are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the request by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, including for the reasons referred to by the Deputy. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400 and allowances, and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards recurrent costs, including insurance. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support. Insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I consider that the Blackstock report represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am aware of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level and it is my intention to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools. In this connection, I have already shown my commitment by the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>

      <Col N="365" /> In addition, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Tuition is generally free for participants on full time programmes in further education and at higher education under-graduate level, while students on part-time programmes are charged fees. There are of the order of 1.1 million adults aged 15-64 who have less than upper second level education. It is not considered feasible to introduce free education for part-time participants in this group at this stage, given the scale of the challenge which is required to promote a framework for lifelong learning. The developments proposed in the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, provide for large scale increases in adult literacy investment, a major expansion of part time options at further education level, the development of supporting services such as guidance and child care third level initiatives to promote adult friendly policies, and capital and structural investment. Given the scale of change needed, the priority is to expand the flexibility of core programmes and services for adults and to <Col N="366" /> concentrate fee relief for part-time participation on those most at risk. The impact of this policy on the participation of specific groups will be monitored.</P>
      <P>The back to education initiative under which part-time options for adults in further education are being expanded, provides for free tuition for participants and their dependants who are unemployed, in receipt of medical cards, means-tested welfare payments or family income supplements. In addition, a reduction to 30% of tuition costs is provided for unwaged students with less than upper second level education, while the remaining part time students will be charged fees. The person to whom the Deputy refers does not qualify for fee relief under the new initiative. However, grants are paid each year to vocational education committees under the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme under which flexible supports may be provided on a discretionary basis to enable disadvantaged students to participate in courses free or at nominal cost. It is understood that the person involved in this case has recently agreed to provide information to the Kerry Education Service which would help establish her eligibility for assistance under this scheme. The fee quoted has been calculated on the basis of £2 per hour and is in keeping with charges elsewhere across the system towards delivery costs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I announced on 4 January last will run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year.</P>
      <P>A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes. third through sixth classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £6,454 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further. To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, an enhanced support structure is being put in place to assist teachers in putting the scheme into practice. The support structure will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>

It is expected that the <Col N="370" /> fees charged in 2001 will amount to approximately £5 million while the cost of running the examinations will be in the region of £20 million.</P>
      <P>This Government revised the scheme of exemption from the payment of examination fees and based it on the general medical services card scheme. Through quadrupling the funding available for fee alleviation we have ensured that about one third of the entire student population are no longer liable for examination fees.</P>
      <P>A special entry fee of £145 is payable in respect of a candidate who remains in school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate examination. A course fee of £100 is also payable in respect of such candidates. These special fees are charged on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect those who have already benefited by the normal course of post-primary schooling, and who wish to sit the examinations a second time, to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources. Candidates who are holders of a medical card, or whose parent/guardian is the holder of a medical card, are of course exempt from those special fees.</P>

      <P>The new £6.1 million arts and music grant which I recently announced was paid to all primary schools in County Sligo. The grant will enable schools to purchase equipment and materials and to initiate activities to enable children to participate in visual arts, music, drama, dance and literature. The grant works out at £13 per pupil with a minimum grant of £780 being provided for schools of under 60 pupils. The grant was lodged to all primary schools' bank accounts in late November.</P>
      <P>In the area of music, the grant may be used to support the making of music through instruments such as chime bars, cymbals, triangles, tin whistles. It can also be used to buy listening materials such as compact discs, tapes. Similarly, in the visual arts, schools will be enabled to purchase materials such as brushes, drawing and colouring materials.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that schools would, where possible, use some of this money to organise trips to concert halls, art galleries and similar institutions so that children experience music, visual arts, drama, dance and literature in such settings. More detailed guidelines are being finalised by my Department at the moment. These guidelines will issue to all schools shortly and will set out the scope of the grant and the purposes for which it can be used.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional psychologist has recently joined the NEPS team serving schools in Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.

      <P>Schools participating in the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports, to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. In County Sligo, 45 schools have been invited to participate in the new programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, through the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be allocated the services of a teacher/coordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Rural schools that could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to <Col N="375" /> teacher-co-ordinator support. All schools participating in the programme will also receive financial support for the delivery of targeted in-school and out-of-school activities.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The staffing schedule for primary schools in the 2001-02 school years has not yet been finalised. As soon as the schedule is finalised, a circular will issue to all boards of management. This staffing schedule will apply to all primary schools, including schools participating in the new programme.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to urban schools, eligible for additional teaching posts under the programme, is that the allocation of new posts is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three year period and the implementation of the maximum class sizes. The staffing allocation for these schools for the 2001-02 school year will be based on the enrolment in the school at 30 September 2000 and will be examined in the context of any changes to the staffing schedule for national schools.</P>

      <P>The walk tall programme continues in primary schools. It is expected that by June 2001 a total of 3,000 schools will have accessed support from my Department for this programme. The On My Own Two Feet programme has now been subsumed into the social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; programme. By the end of 2003 every post-primary school is expected to have SPHE as an integral part of its programme in junior cycle.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of both programmes was carried out by an external, independent consultant. The evaluation of the walk tall programme was carried out among teachers who had been involved with it and the satisfaction rate in regard to the training received by them and the materials provided for them was very high.</P>
      <P>The evaluation of the on my own two feet was carried out among students. The report on that programme indicated that students who had been exposed to the programme had stronger belief in the negative outcomes of substance misuse. The programme was found to have significant effects in the area of self-esteem and assertiveness. The report concludes that a social skills approach is best suited to providing the generic skills that can be applied to many situations such as smoking, alcohol abuse or other substance misuse and in other life skills situations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware of the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, that I announced on 4 January last, which will run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three-year period through staff allocations to <Col N="380" /> implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £7,590 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>
    <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, an enhanced support structure is being put in place to assist teachers in putting the scheme into practice. The support structure will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The staffing of the school in question will be determined when the schedule has been finalised.</P>
