    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The report of the steering group on basic income was made available to the social partners on 2 March last and placed in the Oireachtas Library at the same time. The steering group commissioned consultants to assess, as the first phase, the static effects of the introduction of a basic income system and, as a second phase, to take account of the dynamic effects and the long-term sustainability of a basic income scheme. The first phase was carried out by two separate consultants &ndash; Professor Charles Clarke, St. John's University, New York, and the ESRI. The second phase was carried out by a consortium led by the ESRI. The consultants' reports are included in full in the report of the steering group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The studies show that a basic income system would give rise to an intricate set of effects and that issues arise in terms of the impact on the labour supply, the labour market, migration and the informal economy and economic growth and competitiveness. They show the tax rate neces<Col N="498" /> sary to finance a basic income approach could range from 47.26% to 53%.</P>
    <P>The steering group's task was to undertake an appraisal of the concept and of the full implications of introducing a basic income payment to all citizens. It was not its role to reach a conclusion or make recommendations about basic income.</P>
    <P>I agree with the steering group's view that the studies represent a significant move forward in our understanding of the complex issues involved. These need to be teased out in detail. Implementation was not part of the steering group's mandate but clearly considerations of the administrative implications are an essential part of the next step. The report of the steering group has been made available to the social partners and their views will be taken into account fully.</P>
    <P>The complexity and range of issues to be considered in taking forward the proposal for a basic income mean that a number of Departments will be involved in the preparation of a Green Paper. At present, my Department is in contact with the relevant Departments with a view to agreeing arrangements for the preparation of a Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding recent high levels of economic growth and current levels of employment, does the Taoiseach accept there is a huge problem requiring radical restructuring along the lines of the guaranteed basic income report when the percentage of people below the poverty line as measured by the ESRI is higher than it was in 1987 and given that the gap between rich and poor has widened over the past 12 years and continues to widen? Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need to bring forward the Green Paper without further delay? Will he indicate as specifically as possible when it might be published? Will he give a date, if possible? Will the Green Paper be more specific in dealing with a proposed guaranteed basic income scheme or will it continue the work to date which has dealt with the concept? When will we get down to the detail of the scheme in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the work was finished and possibly prior to that, I had asked officials to examine how we could do that and take the work forward. The Deputy has seen the papers and the complexity of the issue. It is not an easy topic. The steering group comprised all the social partners and they all made their submissions. It involved CORI, the INOU and groups representing the fourth pillar, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the National Women's Council and other groups working in that area. I have asked them to take on all the work that is done and there are a number of Departments involved. Unless everybody works together we will not get a meaningful Green Paper so I asked them to start that work, which they did in early March. I have not asked them for a date; I have asked them to get on with the <Col N="499" /> work as quickly as possible to produce a Green Paper. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and other Departments are examining this and I will give an assessment of the date as soon as I can. As they have taken all of the papers and the documents from the consortium in the ESRI, where a large group of people worked on this, a lot of the work is already there. It would be nice if the conclusions were a bit more manageable, but they had a certain job to do, as outlined in Partnership 2000, and it did not come down to conclusions and recommendations in the way it normally would. I certainly will not delay. We will move as quickly as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach, in addition to the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, other than his own Department, what Departments are involved in drafting a Green Paper? We have been promised such a Green Paper and I wonder when we can see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is promised, but it took the group over four years to do their work so there will not be any undue delay with the Green Paper; I simply do not know how long it will take. My own Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are involved and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was involved. The social partners were involved and, even though the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was not on the steering group, many of the issues brought up were agricultural and consultation was sought from ICOS, Macra na Feirme, ICMSA, the IFA and others. We should not re-enact all the work as an enormous amount has been done in the last four years, which we should be able to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's questions asked if the Taoiseach had a view on the third consultancy report. He has not expressed any view which, be it deliberate or accidental, is in keeping with the Taoiseach's approach to various issues lately. I ask the Taoiseach if he has a view on the implications for behaviour in the labour market, and the implications for the economy, of a situation where, as he has pointed out himself, the single rate of tax that would apply would be between 47.26% and 53%. Is the Taoiseach indicating in this concept that the single rate of tax that would apply to any income earned above the basic income would be in that range and therefore equivalent to the current total of taxation and social welfare contributions made by the highest rate taxpayers? Would that not have an effect on incentive to work? Does the Taoiseach consider that a combination of that level of taxation and a replacement payment for employers' PRSI, as indicated in the third report, would have very <Col N="500" /> substantial effects on the behaviour of employees and of employers? Could the Taoiseach indicate if, were the Government were to proceed in the direction of a basic income, he would consider it necessary to move towards a single rate of income taxation in order to make the transition possible? If these issues are not dealt with in the Green Paper, that paper will not advance the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent has been diligent in raising this issue over the last four years and I have put forward my views on it many times. Deputy Dukes will be aware that there was a commitment under Partnership 2000 that this work would be undertaken and I have been diligent about making sure the work gets done. Deputy Dukes mentioned the tax rate and while there is a difference, the work by the consultants indicated that the tax rate necessary to finance a base income system would range from 47% to 53%. Professor Clarke estimated it would require a rate of 47.26% and the ESRI estimated a rate of 51.6%. When the social solidarity fund was specified more precisely, the rate was nearer to 53%. Clearly, the different rates represent the different approaches to determining the tax base, the cost of Government services and the treatment of the social solidarity fund. The steering group considered that the sets of estimates represented a reasonable indicator of a range of likely rates and the difference did not invalidate the study. The Deputy is correct in saying that they are the specified rates.</P>
      <P>The different rates also reflect differences in the respective approaches to determining the tax base and the cost of funding Government services, other than the elements of a basic income system, which has to be taken into account. The big issue in all this was the treatment of the social solidarity fund which would compensate those losing out in a transition period. An enormous part of the work, concerning those who would lose or gain, was carried out both on the ESRI model and the New Zealand model. To date, a basic income has not been tried or implemented in any country.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 of the inquiry sought relevant evidence to give best judgment on the likely impact of a basic income, and did so without any model. They did it on the ESRI model which is a good one at international level and has been perfected over the past 15 years. The key issues emerging from that inquiry were that a basic income would have a big impact on labour supply, migration, the informal economy and the current labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the impact be positive or negative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases negative. It would also have an impact on economic growth and competitiveness. In fairness, I should say that as growth rates become higher there should be a corresponding lowering of tax rates. Much of the early work on the Green Paper was done from <Col N="501" /> 1997 to 1999. As economic growth has increased it should have a correspondingly positive impact if one is using current 2001 figures. I do not know what that figure is but it is only fair to say that it would pull it down as the economy grows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>And equally, if growth rates decelerated, the opposite would be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach just keeps saying it is very complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why nobody in the world has undertaken this. It involves bringing in a basic income system and totally changing the social welfare, tax and other systems in one fell swoop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest thing to it was the New Zealand system &ndash; the big bang effect many years ago &ndash; which worked in some cases but not in others. There was a commitment to undertake an inquiry into this system, however, and it has been useful. It has not been overly expensive although much time has been devoted to it. I intend to see it through as per the negotiations on Partnership 2000, to which I was not a party. This was requested, however, and I will continue to follow it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the basic income system has not been tried elsewhere. Would he agree that the incremental changes that have been taking place, bringing together the tax and social welfare systems, are making it that much easier to introduce a guaranteed basic income as time goes on? There is a certain trend which would be of assistance in the introduction of a basic income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the date for completion of the Green Paper, has the Taoiseach given a target or working timeframe by which he would like the Green <Col N="502" /> Paper published? That information would help us to estimate whether it will be published in the autumn, before the budget or even before the general election.</P>
    <P>In relation to the figures on taxation mentioned by Deputy Dukes  &ndash; I thank Deputy Dukes for his interest in this matter which we discussed some years ago &ndash; does the Taoiseach agree the figures the Deputy used were based on the study which used the January 1999 estimates and that the revised rates put the tax base at about 42.7%? That figure is fluctuating with economic growth but it might be more current when talking about this issue than the figures in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be lower. I do not want to guesstimate that but certainly they would reflect the economic growth in three years. Taking all the data that is available from all the working papers, I have asked the relevant people &ndash; we probably received some of the working papers from the ESRI only recently &ndash; to examine how we would frame a Green Paper. I did not answer Deputy Dukes on that earlier. He is correct. For it to be a meaningful Green Paper it would have to contain the kinds of issues he raised to bring it forward, but they have not been able to make an assessment to date and I do not want to give a date off the top of my head. I am sure they will give me that fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give a season off the top of his head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I gave the Deputy a fair few dates on when I would have the reports, which were out of my hands and went way outside on this particular issue. None of the work on this issue reached the target even though an enormous amount of effort was put into it. I want to record my thanks to all of the people in the Departments, Professor Clarke, and all of the individuals in the ESRI who worked on this issue. They have been going through the submissions of the social partners, of which there are about 20&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy Sargent, as soon as I can get an assessment of when they can do it, I will give it to him.</P>
      <P>On the question about the tax and social welfare changes, the reform of the systems, tax credits and all that has happened in the standardisation of social welfare, including the computerisation of the linked systems, there is no doubt that every one of those issues is helping in this area. They are also helping in the formulation of the information. The information available now compared with when I answered the Deputy's questions about three years ago is far better. As the Deputy will recall, we could not link the systems and we had a debate here on that three years ago, but being able to cost in the social solidarity fund and all the other issues have improved immensely since when we started this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago, the Taoiseach and his Government introduced the individualisation of the tax code. Given the conclusions reached in coming to that policy statement, why has the Government not moved towards the individualisation of the social welfare code? Does the Taoiseach accept that a movement in that direction would be the first step forward in achieving a greater distribution of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has discussed this issue in the House on many occasions and outlined his views on it. In my opinion there are many arguments in favour of it and he has expressed a similar view. However, I do not believe the arguments in respect of it link into those that obtain in relation to the basic income. It is a different issue. Perhaps it might lead to a fairer system, but it is not the same concept as what is being attempted <i>vis-à-vis </i>the basic income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can count on your generosity, Sir. Will the Taoiseach confirm that perhaps the best publication date for the Green Paper would be lá Philib an cleite? Will he indicate how he believes people would react if they were <Col N="504" /> informed that, in a basic income system &ndash; I will now quote from the CORI example&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event I will cite the CORI example; I will not quote or read from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That might well be the case and no doubt we will discuss that matter later. However, I hope I can speak about CORI for a moment without raising the Deputy's hackles. Will the Taoiseach indicate how he believes people might react if they were informed that, for example, anyone aged between 21 and 64 would obtain a basic income of £91 per week from the State and that by 2002, as CORI states, they would pay, on every other pound they earned each week, 40% tax? In my opinion the aspiration towards a 40% tax rate is wildly optimistic. Will the Taoiseach state whether he expects this would have an effect on people's readiness to work and, in particular, if it would encourage them not to evade tax? One of the virtues ascribed to a basic income system is that because everybody is treated in the same way, nobody will want to cheat on their tax. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether a single tax rate of over 40% on all earnings over £90 per week would persuade people not to try to evade tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes knows, the Government's policy is to try to remove people on basic incomes from the tax net altogether. We have been successful in removing approximately 300,000 people from the tax net and approximately 38% of those in employment pay no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only do what was asked of me in Partnership 2000 in respect of this matter. The argument put forward by CORI and others who wanted us to follow through correctly on this project was based the fact that between 1% and 1.5% of the population remain on long-term unemployment. Their philosophy is that the examination should be carried out in order to see how the distributional effects will operate and how it will work for those the less well off in society. That has been the basis of the project since the outset. It is clear that, to date, many of the difficulties have not been resolved. However, we have an obligation to complete the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In regard to the outcome of the European Council at Stockholm, I would refer to the full statement I made to the Dáil on Thursday, 29 March. In my statement, I mentioned the joint letter submitted by Prime Minister Blair and I to Prime Minister Persson on 8 March. The letter was positively received by colleagues and the issues raised were reflected in the Presidency conclusions of the European Council. The conclusions of the Council have, of course, been laid before both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress that the core business of the Stockholm European Council was ensuring further progress on the economic and social agenda of the European Union, building on the strategy we set out at Lisbon last year, namely, to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010. The meeting produced a number of important results which will, over the coming years, bear fruit in <Col N="506" /> terms of better policies and better economic and social performance at the European level.</P>
    <P>I will give the House some examples. The European Council addressed the demographic challenge of an ageing population of which people of working age constitute an ever smaller part; discussed how to create more and better jobs, accelerate economic reform, modernise the European social model and harness new technologies; issued strategic guidance for the broad economic policy guidelines in order to achieve sustained growth and stable macro economic conditions and agreed to improve procedures so that the European Council's spring meeting will become the focal point for an annual review of economic and social questions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important achievement of the Council was the agreement to fast track the development of a common approach to the regulation of financial services. Ireland has strongly supported for many years the implementation of the financial services action plan. The implementation of this plan has been subject to lengthy delays which have prevented Europe taking full advantage of the benefits of the single market. It was a key Irish priority that this aspect of the Union's agenda be given added impetus by the European Council. The conclusions of the European Council were most encouraging in this regard. In particular it approved the resolution on more effective securities market regulation and considers that it constitutes a good platform for effective co-operation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in this area; agreed that the financial services action plan be fully implemented by 2005, with every effort made by all parties concerned to achieve an integrated securities market by the end of 2003 by giving priority to securities markets legislation provided for in that plan and endorsed the objective of a well functioning risk capital market by 2003 through implementation of the risk capital action plan.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased that the European Council supported the committed and active involvement of social partners in implementing reform, the success of which requires commitment from employers and workers at grass roots. This commitment to social partnership was made no less pleasing by the fact that the Council endorsed the setting up as soon as possible of the European Observatory for Industrial Change as part of the Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. This development will reinforce the role of the foundation, which is based in Loughlinstown, in supporting the development of European policy in this area.</P>
    <P>There was a full debate on the situation in the agricultural sector at the European Council. The Council welcomed and stressed the importance of effective co-operation among national authorities and endorsed the thorough measures being taken by the Council, the Commission and the member states. The Council expressed its determination, which is fully shared by the Government and me, <Col N="507" /> to contain and ultimately eradicate foot and mouth disease and BSE.</P>
    <P>The European Council had a meeting and lunch with the Russian President at which we indicated our support for the modernisation of the Russian economy and the building of a genuine partnership between Russia and the EU based on common values. In this context we expressed our strong concern about the situation in Chechnya and stressed the need for a political solution to the conflict as a matter of urgency. We also had a meeting with the president of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at which we reaffirmed our support for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the problems in the region.</P>
    <P>As I said in my statement, the conclusions reached at Stockholm are proof of the European Union's commitment to working for Europe and for Ireland. The EU has created a framework within which its people have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. It has also created a framework within which Ireland and its people have managed to reach new levels of economic prosperity, international recognition and cultural confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not have any official engagements outside Ireland during April. My schedule for the remainder of the year is as follows. I have accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Scotland on 20 June. I plan to go on an official visit to Iceland on 25 June. I will attend the UN General Assembly special session on HIV and AIDS on 26 June. I plan to go to Brazil and Argentina on an official visit from 17 to 26 July. Later on this year, I plan to go on an official visit to the Czech Republic in September. I plan to visit New York on 8 to 10 November to accept an award from the US Council for Commerce and Industry and to meet the Irish chamber of commerce movement. I will also attend the European Council meetings in Ghent, Belgium on 19 October and in Laeken on 14 and 15 December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement last Thursday week about the European Council the Taoiseach told us he had taken the opportunity of the meeting to express his support for the UK Government's efforts to avoid the spread of foot and mouth disease. Could the Taoiseach tell us what action, if any, he has taken since then? Could he explain why, on the one hand, we were told measures were in hand for Irish officials and equipment to carry out disinfection procedures at British ports, while, on the other hand, we were told that neither the Prime Minister's office in London nor the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food knew anything about it? What is the current position? Is the Government or the British Government flying a kite? What is being done to ensure that the maximum possible measures are taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the meaning of the statement from the Council that it issued broad economic policy guidelines in order to achieve sustained growth <Col N="508" /> and stable macro-economic conditions? Are these guidelines ones to which the Taoiseach now feels himself attached? Are they guidelines to which the Minister for Finance will adhere in the future? Does the Taoiseach think there is any danger that we will see a repetition during the coming year of the kind of nonsensical row that went on between the Minister for Finance and the European Commission?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the second question first. Broad economic policy guidelines are now issued at the spring summit every year. They are discussed at ECOFIN and then come to the European Council for ratification. In common with other countries' leaders, I set down our views on those. Last year, the broad economic guidelines were used in a way that we did not expect and that has been well documented. We again stressed our position, that to achieve sustainable growth in the economy and to keep employment strong there are certain factors we have to deal with. Almost all other countries made statements about their positions. They will continue to be used as benchmarks by the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very significant word these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. I had an informal meeting with Pedro Solbes. We discussed what had happened and how he intends to use these. I hope it will not create any difficulties for him or for us.</P>
      <P>For the six weeks since the foot and mouth disease crisis started, we have raised the issue of arrangements for disinfectants at British ports. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I as well as others have made this point.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting in Stockholm, I met the Prime Minister Mr. Blair and gave him the report of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, outlining what they believe is required to reach our standards at the ports. Spraying was not being done, but a disinfectant policy was being followed at the ports. However, our officials did not believe this to be adequate. Following that meeting, Mr. Blair kindly agreed to contact his relevant officials to try to improve the situation. This did happen for a period with some of the ports. Other ports indicated that it was too costly and too cumbersome and did not continue doing it. When the British officials advised us that these were commercial ports, our officials in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources entered into direct dialogue with the ports, each of which is independent. These discussions have continued for the past two weeks or so and they have now almost reached agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the foot and mouth disease crisis, officials at Dublin Port have developed what is considered to be an excellent state of the art spraying process. It can be done automatically or administered by a person. It is the view of the Department of the Marine and Natural <Col N="509" /> Resources and the interdepartmental group that we should put these facilities into the British ports under Irish contract with Irish workers and Ireland will pay for it. They were discussing this until late last night and they hope to finalise arrangements today or tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the British ports.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are not&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, officials at Downing Street were unable to do what we wanted. I want to acknowledge their input but the ports are independent of them and so we dealt directly with the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that in contrast to the Lisbon Spring Summit which was considered to be progressive and fairly radical, there were two major setbacks in Stockholm to which he has not fully or properly referred? Perhaps he might indicate his attitude in this regard: the refusal in the first instance by the French to open up their energy markets even though some major French utilities are operating in other liberalised energy markets and the ambiguity, if not hesitancy, surrounding the Lamfalussy Report on financial services and a single securities market and regulatory authority in the European Union. Will he agree that both are essential to maintain the momentum of Lisbon? Why is it that the Taoiseach's official reply failed to highlight these matters in any significant way as has been done by all the commentators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn will acknowledge that I referred to the energy related matter in my lengthy statement on Thursday, 29 March 2001. A great deal of effort made by the Presidency to bring the French onside on that issue did not prove successful. Prime Minister Jospin could not agree on many issues and the matter was set aside. Everybody else was supportive of the proposals and ready to move on. I assume the matter will be kept under review by the Presidency. It creates difficulties in the gas and energy markets for the French side who were unable to make any significant movement in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ECOFIN which met on the Friday of the Stockholm Summit meeting made major progress regarding the financial services sector. There was general agreement that progress was being made on this issue which has been around since the Luxembourg Summit in 1997 &ndash; various aspects of it date back to 1993 and 1992. Deputy Quinn's question relates to the work done at the Lisbon Summit last year. It was a new venture, a ten year strategy and it caught many headlines and was seen to be very dynamic. António Guterres as Portuguese Prime Minister played a major role in that area. It did not receive the same amount of attention this year as it was merely a following on of work previously done with the inclusion of <Col N="510" /> some new elements. By and large, it was a report of progress to date since the Lisbon Summit. In fairness to Prime Minister Persson, it achieved what it set out to do. We agreed to continue to make progress in achieving the targets set out at Lisbon while seeking to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy by 2010. That was the challenge which António Guterres set last year and we were following on that this year. In that regard, the summit was a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What discussions took place on the evolving security structures within the European Union at the spring meeting? Will the Taoiseach tell the House what is behind the change proposed at Nice regarding the security arrangements? The Western European Union was becoming an integral part of the evolution of the Union but that has been side tracked, with the exception of one particular reference. What discussions have taken place on those issues? Will the Taoiseach agree that the best way to secure support for the Nice Treaty and for the future evolution of the Union in the security area is to be upfront with the public and tell them exactly what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is none. This was the spring economic summit and these issues were not discussed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, told the House last week that the Western European Union is not part of the arrangement. It is still a separate and outside body. It is not likely to come in the way the Deputy thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has gone out, not come in. That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes made at the Nice summit are few and technical. There is no change to structures or arrangements. I cannot see any additional changes to those which happened several years ago when Mr. Javier Solana joined in his new role. Where the Western European Union is concerned, there are no changes arising from the Nice Treaty and there are unlikely to be any for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the implications for proposed financial services regulation in this country of the financial services action plan mentioned at the Nice summit? It was indicated at the summit that this plan would be fully implemented by 2005 and that the securities market aspect would be fully implemented by the end of 2003. Will the Taoiseach also indicate the new implications for the regulation of the gas and electricity sectors of the liberalisation measures announced recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On gas, electricity and liberalisation, these are mainly competition issues that will open up these sectors in the same way that telecoms and other markets have been opened up <Col N="511" /> in recent years. There will be some delay due to the French position but there is a strong view in the European Council that these sectors are holding back aspects of the Single Market. The new measures will give better competition, lower consumer prices and extend into new areas. All reports from the past decade which have been discussed at European Council level indicate that these directives are necessary to move forward. In the Irish case that is what will happen. We already have ESB legislation drafted, some of which is before the House. With the latest arrangements on the gas pipeline it was stated that Bord Gáis must begin preparations for either strategic partnerships or new financial structures.</P>
      <P>On the financial resolutions, the main benefits are to the flexibility of the industry here. The industry will be able to work in a simpler and more cost effective way than was possible previously. This will apply not only to the financial services sector but across all financial houses in Ireland. It is believed the Single Market has prohibited the financial services sector from doing much of what should have been possible. This includes products and services that could have been provided as well as the internationalisation of business. The restrictions in the new directives will put a number of regulatory controls in place to benefit consumers but it will also make the Single Market work. This applies not only to the current market of 350 million people, but this will soon increase to a market of 500 million people&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the implementation on the Govern ment's White Paper on supporting voluntary activity.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of implementing the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector is proceeding steadily. As the House will be aware, the publication of the White Paper marked a fundamental change in attitudes to the provision of support for community and voluntary groups. A White Paper implementation unit has been established in my Department. Its function is to ensure implementation of the recommendations and decisions contained in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provides for the establishment of an implementation and advisory group consisting of representatives from both the voluntary-community sector and statutory sector. This group will be co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Health and Children. The implementation and advisory group will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the decisions in the White Paper and will identify any unresolved issues arising in a national context. This group will be of enormous assistance in driving the White Paper forward.</P>
      <P>At present, the voluntary and community sector is involved in a process to select representatives to the implementation and advisory group. My Department is providing assistance, including financial assistance, to the community and voluntary sector to ensure appropriate representational structures from that sector. The Deputy may be aware that the sector agreed on an appropriate process and placed advertisements in national newspapers last Friday, 6 April, in this regard.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the speedy nomination of the representatives from the voluntary and community sector to the implementation and advisory group so that the group can begin its important work in ensuring the White Paper proposals are implemented.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provided funding of £7 million to enhance the capacity of the voluntary and community sector to organise itself at national level, to foster the development of additional support and training within the sector and to further support volunteering. The £7 million has been provided under the following headings: an additional £0.6 million for national anti-poverty strategy networks; £1 million support for community and voluntary fora <i>via</i> the Department of the Environment and Local Government; £1 million allocated by my Department to the National Committee on Volunteering; £2 million within the existing community development support programmes administered by my Department to develop technical support and training support services; £2 million for national federations and representative bodies; and £0.4 million for research to quantify the full extent of community and voluntary activity.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="513" /> Work has also begun in my Department on preparing comprehensive legislation on charities and charities fundraising. The Government is committed to producing this legislation as a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that only when this question was tabled did he finally manage to make some progress in terms of the establishment of the implementation and advisory group? Why did the Minister state last September that the group, which has yet to be established, would be established in the autumn? The group will implement the decisions contained in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was absolutely no delay on my part; the delay occurred as a result of the voluntary and community sector choosing its six representatives. The voluntary and community sector, not my Department, placed the advertisement in last Friday's newspapers. The advertisement, of which I have a copy, was sponsored by my Department and placed in the newspapers by the <i>ad hoc </i>committee comprising 20 voluntary and community organisations. The advertisement invited comments on the process through which six representatives would be chosen to participate in the implementation and advisory group. I would like to see the group up and running as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>On other commitments made in the White Paper, has a national committee on volunteering, which the Minister stated would be established last year, yet been established? Has the Minister designated voluntary activity units in all related Departments and has he provided for multi-annual budgeting for all groups which come under the voluntary and community pillar?</P>

The committee has dedicated some £350,000 of the £1 million allocated to it by my Department towards grants for voluntary and community groups throughout the country which wish to participate in activities throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary activity units are in the process of establishment. The White Paper has been warmly welcomed by voluntary and community groups throughout the country as it represented the first time such groups had a substantial say in the promotion of the voluntary and community sector's relationship with the State. The sector was particularly delighted by the commitment in the White Paper that multi-annual budgeting, over a three year period, would be provided for essential voluntary and community activity. To date, funding was only provided on a year to year basis by various Departments with the result that <Col N="514" /> the sector could not plan ahead. The Deputy should welcome such a provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>My objective in the foot and mouth disease crisis has been to ensure that my Department's services provide a speedy and effective response to our customers both in the areas most affected and nationally. My Department is also co-operating with the other State agencies involved to ensure that a co-ordinated and effective response is made by all agencies in the present situation.</P>
      <P>Employees who are laid off as a result of foot and mouth disease may qualify for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance subject to satisfying the usual conditions for receipt of payment. A full-time worker who is laid off due to a cessation of work would normally satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work. Consequently, he or she would qualify for an unemployment payment subject to satisfying either the contribution conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or the means test for receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In regard to lay-offs arising from the crisis, deciding officers in my Department's local offices would have regard to the temporary nature of the lay-offs, to the expectation that employment will be resumed once relevant restrictions are eased or lifted and to the fact that, in the circumstances, the persons concerned may not have had an opportunity to consider other employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons whose self-employment has ceased due to foot and mouth disease may also qualify for unemployment assistance for the duration of the lay-off. As this payment is subject to a means test, <Col N="515" /> income from all sources is taken into account in the assessment.</P>
    <P>In the event that a person does not qualify for an unemployment payment, he or she can apply for supplementary welfare allowance at the local health centre and the application will be determined on the basis of the person's present circumstances and immediate needs. I have initiated a range of special measures to facilitate people who need to avail of my Department's services at this time, in order to streamline the process to the greatest possible extent. In addition, I established a special task force to review the range of responses required in the areas most directly affected by this crisis in County Louth. The task force is overseeing a number of practical measures to address this situation and will report to me shortly in regard to the full range of activities required to address this issue. A considerable number of the measures already indicated by the task force and discussed with local groups have already been put in place.</P>
    <P>A non-EEA national who has been allowed into the State to take up employment on foot of a work permit would not, in the event of becoming unemployed, satisfy the statutory condition of being available for employment and would not, therefore, have an entitlement to an unemployment payment. The work permit issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment confines a non-EEA national to employment with a specific named employer. This condition of the work permit implies a restriction on the availability for work of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>My officials are involved in ongoing discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see whether some mechanism can be put in place to allow non-EEA nationals to qualify for an unemployment payment in the event of involuntary unemployment. A non-EEA national may, however, be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance where his or her means are insufficient to meet his or her needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 36, will the Minister indicate the number of people in receipt of UA and UB as a direct result of the foot and mouth disease crisis? Will he further indicate what he expects this figure to rise to by the end of 2001? Does the Minister agree with the President and General Secretary of SIPTU that the real impact of the crisis will only become clear in the coming months as holiday bookings continue to be cancelled? A conference which was supposed to take place in a nearby hotel in the last few days has been cancelled. People such as chefs, waiters and so on working in the tourism industry will be laid off and there will be a further downturn in the food industry. Will the Minister agree that this will be a problem in the coming months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will he agree with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed who carried out a very <Col N="516" /> interesting survey of employment exchanges which seemed to indicate that a few weeks ago over half the offices had not received specific instructions to be flexible? Will he agree the three day rule, in particular, is very harsh on workers affected by the foot and mouth crisis because one receives no payment for the first three days after signing on? All one can hope for in the first week is approximately £38. Will the Minister agree that his track record in this regard is very bad? This time last year I asked him specifically about problems being faced by seasonal workers in the south-west region of Cork and Kerry. Lollipop men and women wished to receive payments during the time they were off school and seasonal workers wished to receive payments during the slack period. At that stage, officials of the Minister's Department were strictly enforcing the regulations, and this is how he is now reacting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's latter point that there has been a change in the interpretation of the regulations. As a result of the economic policy of this Government in particular, it is a fact that jobs have been available in recent years, which was not the case a number of years ago. There is an onus on officials of my Department when considering cases of people who may be laid off at different periods during the year to ensure taxpayers' money is not paid to people who could perhaps take up employment.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy said in this regard. I will repeat what I said in regard to these issues during our discussions at the committee meeting last week. The guidelines drawn up in regard to genuinely seeking work and being available for work are exactly the same as the guidelines proposed by my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took up office four years ago, I merely signed off on the regulations that had been prepared. My deciding officers, who are independent of me &ndash; I do not make the decisions on whether one should receive unemployment benefit  &ndash; have been instructed to take into consideration the circumstances of people laid off as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. The experience throughout all our offices has been that a very sympathetic approach is being adopted by officials. They fully accept that people laid off as a result of the foot and mouth crisis would not be in a position to seek other work at this time. I do not accept what the Deputy has said because that direction has been given to all the offices. There has been a comprehensive response in regard to all these issues, whether unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or farm assist. In relation to farm assist, in order to assist farmers throughout the country, partic<Col N="517" /> ularly in my area, we have eased the situation in relation to the means test to ensure the payment is not based on the accounts of the previous year but on current circumstances, which is a big change.</P>
      <P>The figures for unemployment assistance amount to 140, excluding Louth, nine for farm assist, 636 for unemployment benefit and six others, totalling 791. In County Louth, which has the highest unemployment benefit assistance and farm assist, 150 people have applied, including 35 for unemployment assistance, 56 unemployment benefit and, because of the situation in the Cooley Peninsula, 59 farm assist, bringing the total throughout the country for farm assist to 68. These are all claims, a proportion of which may not necessarily be paid at this time.</P>

      <P>On non-EEA nationals, is it not extraordinary that just last year, at the height of the Celtic tiger, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, was encouraging 200,000 plus workers to come to Ireland to take up jobs in the food industry, tourism industry and so on to supplement the workforce due to a 10% growth rate each year during the past three to four years? It is extraordinary that the Minister should come to this House following six weeks of a national crisis and tell these workers that there is no specific facility for them to access social welfare benefits. These people, whom we have all come across in every hostelry and hotel in the city, have served us with distinction and ability. Many of these people work in the meat industry and there are allegations that some of them are not being paid the minimum wage. Conditions are the same despite the raft of measures the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Minister of State, Deputy Kitt&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are allegations that the raft of worker protection measures I tried to introduce in this House are not being applied to these workers. Following six weeks of a national crisis, the Minister states in this House that there are no plans or no specific safety net for these workers. All he can do is tell them to go to their local clinic to try to draw supplementary welfare benefit. Despite the fact that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made such a big play of boosting the workforce with workers from outside the EEA &ndash; we are very familiar with Latvians and so on &ndash; the Minister is stating here today that there is no specific social welfare scheme available for them. Shame on the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, all social welfare schemes are based on legislation and I could not introduce a new scheme in a matter of weeks. It is wrong of him to give the impression <Col N="518" /> that there is no safety net for these people. There is the same safety net for non-EEA nationals as for our own citizens who fail to qualify for social welfare entitlements, which is the supplementary welfare allowance system. This works extremely well because community welfare officers in the health boards have complete discretion to make not just the basic SWA payments, but emergency payments which might be required. That would not necessarily be the case if they were receiving a social welfare payment. From my information, there are not many cases of non-EEA nationals making claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key features of the forthcoming Pensions Bill is the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction and regulation of a new savings vehicle, the personal retirement savings account &ndash; PRSA.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Government's plans for legislation in this area are of great interest, particularly to the social partners and the financial sector. Due to the size and complexity of the Bill, it has not been possible to finalise it before Easter, as had been planned. However, I propose to make the draft legislative framework for PRSAs public on Thursday of this week. This document will also outline the proposed tax treatment of PRSAs. I will ensure that the document is laid before the Houses and that copies are forwarded to the Opposition spokespersons on Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill itself, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, it will be extremely complex legislation making legislative provision for the recommendations of the Pensions Board in a number of areas. For example, in addition to PRSAs, the Bill will contain proposals for the establishment of a pensions ombudsman, a mechanism to deal with the treatment of fund surpluses where pension schemes are wound up, a reduction in the vesting period from five to two years, the revaluation and preservation of benefit in respect of pre-1991 service, the transfer of preserved benefit from funded to unfunded schemes, enhanced member protection in relation to schemes compliance with the requirements of the minimum funding standard, greater consistency in the calculation of transfer values and a mech<Col N="519" /> anism for scheme trustees to introduce indexation of occupational pensions and improved regulation of multi-employer schemes.</P>
    <P>This list, which is not exhaustive, illustrates the many and varied issues which the Bill will address and the Government remains firmly committed to publication as a matter of priority.</P>

Late last year the Taoiseach informed us it would be before the House at Easter.

      <P>If the Deputy understood what is intended in relation to PRSAs, which are much more long-term than a finite savings scheme over five years which only gives a window of opportunity of one year by which one must get into it, he will know that this is much more long-term legislation than the SSIAs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that one of the reasons we have not seen the legislation is that there is a turf war going on between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance on this issue? There is no clear Government thinking on the issue of pensions given that only 600,000 people have occupational pensions. There is a need to radically increase that number. There is confusion and a turf war and, consequently, we are not getting the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. The savings scheme has not in any way delayed the bringing forward of the pension Bill. The pension Bill is incredibly complex that requires very detailed examination by the Parliamentary Counsel. Even though it has been substantially drafted, it has to be signed off by the Parliamentary Counsel. As I said earlier, because other legislation has a time component, such as the four referenda which, hopefully, will be brought forward by the end of May or early June, it has taken precedence in the Parliamentary Counsel's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post will deliver approximately 43 million social welfare payments to customers of my Department during 2001. The cost <Col N="521" /> of this service will be approximately £36 million. The payments delivered by An Post are mainly delivered through books of payable orders cashable weekly at a designated post office in the case of pensioners and recipients of certain other weekly payments and monthly in the case of child benefit. An Post also delivers payments to recipients of unemployment payments through the postdraft system. Under this system payment data are transferred electronically to An Post and can be accessed at the designated post office through the use of a swipe card or, in the case of non-computerised post offices, manually.</P>
      <P>In addition to the payment system, An Post operates the household budgeting scheme under which persons using the postdraft system can opt to have payments made directly to certain utilities. For a number of schemes payment is generally made by cheque produced internally by the Department and mailed to the person concerned. My Department's customers may also opt to have their social welfare payments delivered by electronic fund transfer to their accounts at banks and building societies.</P>
      <P>Of 1.430 million people who receive payment on a monthly or weekly basis, 20% are paid by direct credit to bank and building society accounts, l0% are paid by cheque and the remainder are paid through post offices.</P>
      <P>Further development of the payment systems for social welfare customers will take account of developments in payment systems generally across the country. My overall aim is to ensure that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods is available to my Department's customers and to provide access, on an incremental basis, to the new services and facilities which have become available in the money transmission market so that my Department's customers can choose the service which best suits their personal needs and preferences.</P>

Given the confusion that has arisen over the past week on this issue, will he put it on the record that social welfare recipients will still be entitled to receive their payments directly from An Post? Is it the intention of the Department to put out to tender to other financial institutions, namely, the banks or the credit unions, a tendering process where they will be able to compete against An Post for the provision of the services he has just outlined to the House?</P>

We will not do what <Col N="522" /> the Government of which the Deputy's party, the Labour Party and the former Democratic Left were members, that is, to say it would renew the contract but that the next time it would be renewed, it would have to go out to public tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 42 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme is my Department's primary response to farmers whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by foot and mouth disease. Farm assist is a means tested scheme. Normally, income received in the year prior to which farmers claim this payment is assessed as means. However, inspectors of my Department have been advised to take the current situation into account when assessing means from farming from customers whose income has been adversely affected by the current outbreak.</P>
      <P>I have directed my Department to fast-track the claim process wherever possible in keeping with precautions to prevent the spread of the disease, and to ensure that support is provided without delay to those who need it. Thus, inspectors are deferring their visits to farms to assess means for the duration of the present emergency. Instead, farmers may supply details by telephone or by letter, or they may call personally to their nearest social welfare local office. I have also arranged for direct transfer of relevant information between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's district veterinary offices and my Department's inspectorate to minimise any delay in the processing of claims.</P>
      <P>To ensure farmers generally are aware of the supports that are available, my Department is giving widespread publicity to the farm assist scheme and urging farmers who have been affected by the outbreak to avail of it. In County Louth we issued a mailshot of 700 letters to farmers who have been affected by culling. In addition, I established a task force to review the responses required in the areas most directly affected by the crisis. The task force is overseeing the putting in place of practical measures to address the situation and will report to me shortly on the full range of activities required to address this issue.</P>
      <P>In the period covering the last week in February 2001, when foot and mouth disease was first detected in the UK, to Monday 9 April 2001 a total of 872 additional claims for unemployment payments and 59 farm assist claims were identified as having been made as a result of foot and mouth disease. Employees who are laid off due to the foot and mouth disease may qualify for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance subject to satisfying the usual conditions for receipt of payment.</P>
      <P>Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the legislation. A full-time worker who is laid off due to a cessation of work would normally satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work. Consequently, he or she would qualify for an unemployment payment subject to satisfying either the contribution conditions for receipt of UB, or the means test for receipt of UA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deciding officers working in my Department's local offices have regard to the temporary nature of the layoffs arising from the foot and mouth <Col N="525" /> crisis, to the expectation that employment will be resumed once relevant restrictions are eased or lifted and to the fact that, in the circumstances, the persons concerned may not have had a chance to consider other employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Persons whose self-employment has ceased due to the foot and mouth disease may also qualify for UA for the duration of the layoff. The supplementary welfare allowance schemes are also available to any person whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. A person can make an application at his or her local health centre and the application will be determined on the basis of the person's present circumstances and immediate needs.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a daily basis and we will use every available means to bring supports and services to the attention of those who may need them as a result of the impact of the present crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister held discussions with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ascertain the impact of foot and mouth disease on employment in the tourism sector? Has research been carried out or projections made to determine the level of unemployment which might result from the difficulties faced by that sector? If so, will the Minister provide figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing between myself and my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, regarding the tourism sector generally and my area specifically. I have figures for some tourist areas. It is interesting that, for example, in County Kerry only seven people have applied for UA, two for farm assist and 32 for UB. Up to yesterday, large numbers had not applied. A total of 150 people have applied in County Louth for all those schemes while the total in Cork city is 79. The crisis has still not manifested itself in this regard but part-time workers in the tourism industry would be probably the first victims because employers will tend to keep on full-time workers longer in the hope that the situation will turn around. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is fully conscious of the difficulties in the tourism sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to an earlier Priority Question. What does the Minister expect to happen in the coming months? Has he any projections in this regard? What will be the likely levels of unemployment given that there have been so many cancellations affecting the tourism sector? For example, the three main political party conferences have been cancelled. Our conference was scheduled to take place in the middle of May and while that may have had a small impact in Cork&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the projections given that my trade union colleagues feel the real impact will occur in the coming months? Is it not the case that the Government in the UK has taken a more proactive role in regard to supports for workers in the tourism industry, utilising both the social welfare and taxation systems? I appreciate that goes beyond the Minister's brief but is there is case for a more proactive role on the part of the Government, in particular, in protecting tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to projections, my Department is demand-led and responds to people's claims. We react to demand in regard to applications for unemployment assistance and so on. Applications for UA was slow at the outset. The number of applications in recent times, primarily in my county, has accelerated but it has not manifested itself as much as my Government colleagues and I thought. That may change in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is acutely conscious of the difficulties and has already discussed proposals at Cabinet level to redress some of the incorrect perceptions that exist, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, regarding travelling to Ireland. The Minister will bring forward measures in this respect and he conducted an extremely responsible advertisement campaign at the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept one of the reasons a considerable number of applications has not been made is that many of those who have lost income are involved in casual labour? Many are women who work part-time and are suffering a loss of income as a result of the reduction in their employment and they are not entitled to UA or UB because of their means. Has the Minister considered extending the family income supplement to address this crisis given the predicament that faces thousands of people involved in casual labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement relates only to employees. It does not relate to those who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I asked the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures, when divided between UA and UB, show that the majority qualify for UB. In other words, they qualify on the record of their stamps. I hazard a guess that many of those who qualify for UB are casual and part-time workers who are coming back into the system and who, perhaps, have been in and out <Col N="527" /> of the system over the past number of years. We have not come across major difficulties in this regard or in regard to people being refused. I am not saying there are no refusals. The figures I have provided relate to the number of claims and not to the numbers in receipt of money. There will be some attrition in those figures. Generally, we have not come across major difficulties but if Members are aware of cases where there have been difficulties, we will examine them. People also have the right to appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope they would be assured of a payment. As I said earlier, the difficulty is that they came to Ireland for a specific job. I understand the number of cases related to foot and mouth disease is small, but the position could change in the coming weeks. Ultimately, these people would be entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance, which is available to all residents who fall through the net. I hope their interests will be protected through the supplementary allowance or some other arrangement that may be forthcoming.</P>

        <b>:</b> Farmers in the Minister's constituency clearly have been affected by the foot and mouth disease crisis, but does he accept that farmers in many parts of the country are trying to buy fodder for stock they did not expect to have and that they are also in financial difficulties? Should they also apply for help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I agree with the Deputy that such farmers should come forward for assistance and they have been encouraged to do so. I compliment the farming organisations, particularly the IFA and the ICMSA, on the documents they have produced on this area. The documents also indicate that changes have been made to the farm assist scheme which take into account current means as opposed to last year's means. This is a major change and I hope it will help many farmers. A total of 68 people have applied for farm assist and 59 of the applicants are from my county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The instruction was given by the top officials in my Department who are involved in policy in this area. I had a concern and, as a result, the officials instructed the deciding officers to take into account the particular circumstances of employment arising from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The officers were to take into account that people would not have had an opportunity to seek alternative work because of the restrictions. This would not apply in every instance, but it is relevant in farming related cases because they would have difficulty getting alternative work. In effect, many people would not even have to qualify under the guidelines in the context of paid contributions for unemployment benefit and the means test for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that what he told the House is not what is happening on the ground? Will he state if the farm assist scheme is working at all? For obvious reasons, he identified a number of people in his constituency who have applied for it but, on the basis of previous experience, the scheme does not work. A person must be virtually destitute before he or she qualifies for it on the basis of the regulations laid down by the Minister and applied by the Department and not by deciding officers.</P>
      <P>In relation to supplementary welfare, will the Minister confirm that, due to regulations laid down and the serious restrictions imposed on deciding officers by him recently, it is almost impossible to qualify for the allowance? Will the Minister indicate if he intends to relax any of the previous draconian directions he issued to deciding officers because of the crisis?</P>

I made changes in relation to assessments of capital and these are relevant to farmers who are currently in trouble because of a lack of income. They may have a large amount of capital in a bank or building society which, in the normal course of events, would be included as part of the assessment. However, changes I made two years ago mean that people can have a relatively large amount of capital that is not included in any social welfare means test.</P>
      <P>Other changes in relation to farm assist were requested by the farming organisations and I granted them in the first year of the PPF. Therefore, the Deputy is incorrect in relation to farm assist. I looked at the figures in that regard last night.</P>

      <Quest>if he will allow students over 19 years of age in second level education to continue to qualify for child benefit payments until they complete the leaving certificate; the projected cost of such a provision in one full year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability. In addition, where a parent receives a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, child dependant allowances are paid <Col N="531" /> up to the age of 22 where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government is committed in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to extending child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to child benefit has always been focused on age. The Deputy's proposal would effectively entail the abolition of the age condition for entitlement to child benefit in the case of students who are still in second level education and who have not yet completed the leaving certificate. This could give rise to certain anomalies. First, a measure of this kind would raise equity issues with regard to third level students and students with a disability in first level education in the same cohort who would not be eligible for CB on reaching 19. Second, any person in second level education pursuing a course up to leaving certificate level, including those who return to education as mature students, would become eligible for CB payments. Third, students already receiving payments in their own right under the back to education allowance programme or the vocational training opportunities scheme could become eligible for CB in the absence of an age condition.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that any further improvements in the CB scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and existing commitments for the future development of the scheme. It is estimated that it would cost some £5.2 million in a full year to provide for the continued payment of child benefit to second level students only until they had completed the leaving certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it is the same cost on parents regardless of whether the person doing the leaving certificate is under or over 19? Is he aware that, according to figures from the Department of Education and Science, just 863 students are in this position? Does he not agree it is a simple matter of raising the age to include these people who continue in second level to sit their leaving certificate examination? Does he also not agree that his assertions regarding inequity do not stand up because many third level students are in receipt of grants and other payments as are people in second level engaged in advanced studies whereas the people in question are sitting the leaving certificate and do not receive any support from the&mdash;</P>

      <P>The figures I gave are based on the total figure of children between 18 and 21 in the senior and post-leaving certificate cycle, which we estimate to be 44,000. On the basis that almost 90% of students will have left the senior cycle before reaching 19, the number likely to benefit in the event of child benefit continuing to be payable until the completion of the leaving certificate is estimated to be about 6,500. It is on that we based the figure of £5.2 million. While it appears easy to implement, the Deputy's suggestion of abolishing the age qualification raises huge issues concerning equity between those in second and third levels and mature students. There is no system of child benefit payments in Europe for which the age condition has been abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain to the House the circumstances by which he now finds himself in bad faith, in bad standing and in bad odour with the GAA, the Tánaiste, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, members of the Government and all the rules of Cabinet procedure over an issue of £60 million? Is it not the case that the Taoiseach attempted to manipulate the GAA by allowing it to believe there was an unconditional grant of £60 million, failed to consult the Tánaiste and the members of his Government and that now, after the event, he is telling the GAA that it is not an unconditional offer but an offer in principle? Will the Taoiseach explain what he thought he was at when he brought all the financial procedures we have ever legislated for in this House into disrepute in that way and tried to subvert and corrupt a major national organisation?</P>

      <P>To start with the last question first, the meetings took place with the GAA and the FAI. In regard to the GAA, there were meetings on 14 September and 15 December last year and on 13 February and 3 April. Meetings were held with the FAI on 19 February, 6 March, 3 October, 9 November and 22 November 1999 and on 23 February and 5 March this year. All of those meetings, I believe bar none, were attended by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked me a number of questions on the GAA and I will endeavour to answer all of them. From the outset <Col N="539" /><Col N="540" /> of the Stadium Ireland project, the GAA confirmed it was committed to using Stadium Ireland and in fact the association was represented on the stadium steering committee which oversaw the feasibility study and it is currently represented on the board of Stadium Ireland by its general secretary, Mr. Mulvihill. That commitment came into focus for a firm decision once the outline bid documents issued to consortia for the provision of facilities at Sports Campus Ireland on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. It would not have been possible for the five consortia to make a realistic bid if they did not know what the national sporting organisations intended to do, and 31 May is the date for those bids to come forward.</P>
      <P>In recent months, particularly since Christmas, we have had discussions with the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI to reach a successful conclusion. Following its executive meetings, the IRFU made its position known publicly. The FAI had a specially convened meeting of the entire association on 6 March and the GAA's annual conference was held last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>They were battered into submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In finalising their proposals, the bidders needed to be fully aware of the position of the three major field sports organisations regarding their use of Stadium Ireland. As I said, the final bids are expected to be submitted by 31 May.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the letter which issued to the GAA on 6 April, as is the case with the one issued to the FAI on 6 March, was based on discussions that had been taking place over the period I mentioned and the time had been reached to put on paper the details of the proposals that formed the basis for more detailed formal talks. Those who are familiar with the GAA and its rules and procedures will know that the annual congress is the one meeting every year at which major decisions are made. It is only at congress that fundamental changes to the whole organisation can be agreed. I admit that last week's meeting was more rushed than would normally have been the case.</P>

      <P>I understood the previous week that the congress would be called off for obvious reasons but that was not the case. It decided to hold the congress and asked some of the delegates from County Louth not to attend. This year's congress took place over the weekend. The association was anxious to inform its organisations and delegates to the congress of the details of the stage reached in discussions with the Government which have all taken place in good faith over the dates I mentioned. We thought that was a reasonable, practical and courteous thing to do and I issued the letters on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> In further reply to Deputy Dukes in particular, it is correct that our colleagues in Government did not have the full facts. I do not believe we broke any Cabinet procedures because the position we took was that we would finalise the discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning the Government discussed the recent developments in relation to funding for sport. The objective of Government policy is to make available a high quality infrastructure throughout the country for sport at all levels. It is the objective of the Government to secure an appropriate sharing of sports infrastructure to achieve the best use of available facilities for the benefit of all sports activity. Discussions have been taking place with the sporting bodies, the FAI and the GAA in particular, and the IRFU in furtherance of this objective and some matters remain to be finalised. The establishment of Sports Campus Ireland reflects the policy of providing a comprehensive range of facilities. The funding offers made in good faith to the FAI and the GAA will be honoured on the basis of the letters conveying those offers, but the Government believes, and I reiterated it this morning, that where sporting facilities are funded by the taxpayers, those facilities should be shared as widely as possible to the benefit of the whole community. In the legal discussions that will continue, the offer of financial assistance to the GAA and the FAI will be pursued in that context because it is not just a question of Croke Park, a point I have made time and again. It is a question of using these facilities throughout the country.</P>

That is what the Government decided this morning. A full memorandum will be brought by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to the Government's meeting to discuss this matter in two or three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so in a moment. The second thing that has become clear is the Taoiseach's approach to this matter. He spoke of his final offer to the GAA and stated that things were &ldquo;unclear&rdquo;. With regard to the impressive number of meetings attended by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation but not the Tánaiste, were he and the Minister operating on the basis of any approach agreed by the Government?</P>

I do not recall the exact phrase he used, but how can the Taoiseach state that the offer to the GAA was offer &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;?

However, these negotiations took place in good faith.</P>
      <P>The Government has developed sport in Ireland from the point where it was a Cinderella entity to which only a few million pounds per year were allocated to a position where there is now a reasonable base for it.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the GAA has provided wonderful service to this country over many years? Does he agree that in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, against a background of national and political <Col N="545" /> struggle on this island over generations, the GAA was on the verge of making an historic decision which would reflect the new ethos embodied in the principles of that Agreement, namely, to reverse rule 42 and allow other games played by men and women in this country to be played at the wonderful new stadium at Croke Park which should be completed? Does he further agree that his intervention was deliberately designed, on the eve of that historic congress, to thwart that decision and reverse it? The latter was the considered view of many delegates who attended the congress who expressed the view that the decision would have been to reverse rule 42. Is it not true that the Taoiseach was motivated to cynically intervene at the eleventh hour &ndash; without informing his so-called partners in Government who are locked in at the back of the bus and who cannot get out &ndash; in order to effectively prevent the GAA from expressing a democratic decision in a particular manner? Was it not his sole aim to do so in order to continue with a project which, by his own admission, has to date broken every procedural rule in the Cabinet book regarding the expenditure not of his money or that of Fianna Fáil but that of taxpayers, for which the Government is accountable to the House?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate specifically what Cabinet decision mandated him and the Ministers for Finance and Tourism, Sport and Recreation to make this offer to the GAA? On foot of what Cabinet decision were they operating when they allowed the GAA to believe that a sum of £60 million would be paid up front and, perhaps, that a further £70 million would be forthcoming? If a Cabinet decision to that effect was made, how was it made without the knowledge of the Tánaiste?

The Government believes sporting <Col N="547" /> facilities funded by the taxpayer should be shared as widely as possible for the benefit of the whole community. Our legal discussions with the GAA and the FAI in finalising the offer of financial assistance will be pursued in that context. I have also stated there will be a full report by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for the funding arrangements proposed and the strategy to be pursued in the ongoing discussions with the sporting bodies. I also said that we decided to have an external overview of the Stadium Ireland project to ensure it works and to take account of the cost implications and the ancillary costs, such as access infrastructure and the strategies to manage the ongoing operating costs. Deputy Quinn's view of why I would try to influence a GAA conference is so off the wall I should not bother replying to it.</P>

Why did the Taoiseach decide to issue a letter on the eve of an historic congress which was going to reverse a decision in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and in accordance with the wishes of the majority of GAA supporters and players?

For the same reason, the president of the GAA and his officials made clear to me and my colleagues last Tuesday night that he could not go to his congress and give a clear position to the five bidders unless he knew they would commit a certain number of games and people to Stadium Ireland.

This view is shared by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which recommended a gap of 90 days between publication of a Bill and taking it in the House.

It is such a complex measure that to date neither the Minister nor his Department has been able to publish an explanatory memorandum to accompany the Bill. There are explanatory memorandums accompanying the constitutional amendment Bill relating to the Nice Treaty. We have had explanatory memorandums on the establishment of an international criminal court. As matters stand, this Bill has not received any public attention. There has been no public debate outside this House. We know that to give effect to one of the constitutional amendments which the Minister proposes, it would be necessary to publish more legislation, which he has failed to do even in draft form. In those circumstances, we believe the taking of Second Stage should be postponed until after the Easter recess and until the draft legislation which the Minister envisages necessary to give effect to new Article 35.4 is published.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two distinct but related elements in this Bill to amend the Constitution. Firstly, the proposed new Article 35.4 of the Constitution would provide that a body can be established to investigate or cause to be investigated possible misbehaviour by or incapacity of persons while holding the office of judge and to make and publish findings and recommendations. Secondly, the new Article 35.5 will replace the existing provision for removing a judge from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity with a new provision modelled on that which would apply to the President and which is contained in Article 12.10 of the Constitution. As Deputies will be aware, the existing provision on this matter is that a judge may be removed from office upon resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for the removal.</P>
    <P>The need for improvement in existing arrangements was the subject of recommendations made by the Constitution Review Group in 1996. This group, as Deputies will recall, was chaired by Dr T.K. Whitaker and included among its membership the then Attorney General and a number of high level legal and other experts. The group noted that such provisions as exist short of impeachment for the regulation of judicial conduct are provided for by statute and apply only to judges of the District Court. The group recommended that Article 35 should be amended to allow for regulation by the judges themselves of judicial conduct, in accordance with the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>With reference to removing a judge from office for misbehaviour or incapacity, the Constitution Review Group considered that the present procedures were unsatisfactory in as much as they do not provide clear guidance on vital questions such as which House is to prefer the charge, whether the judge in question is entitled to be represented or to be heard and which House is to hear and determine the charge. In addition, the group said it appeared wrong in principle that the removal of a judge or any other constitutional officer should be decided by a simple majority in both Houses because a Government could use its majority in the Oireachtas to remove such a person for purely partisan reasons. A two thirds majority requirement would provide a safeguard against such a possibility. The group's recommendation was that the Article 12.10 impeach<Col N="558" /> ment process, which applies to the President, should also be used for judges.</P>
    <P>Following on the report of the Constitution Review Group, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, considered the constitutional provisions on the courts and the Judiciary, the outcome of which is contained in the committee's fourth progress report published in November 1999. Its recommendation was that Article 35 should be amended to allow for the review of judicial conduct by a judicial council with a lay element. As regards removal from office, the committee recommended a provision along the lines of Article 12.10 but with a simple majority rather than a two thirds majority requirement for the relevant resolutions in the Houses.</P>
    <P>The events which came to be known as the &ldquo;Sheedy affair&rdquo; in 1998 highlighted the need for new provisions on judicial accountability and for better and more detailed provision for removing a judge from office. The question of judicial conduct and ethics was raised in the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission which was published in April 1999. Following the publication of that report the then Chief Justice, the late Mr. Liam Hamilton, established the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics, as recommended by the working group. The committee, when established, consisted of the Chief Justice and each of the court presidents &ndash; Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and the then Mr. Justice Ronan Keane &ndash; and the Attorney General. That committee undertook a very thorough and wide ranging review of judicial accountability and a comparative study of the position in other jurisdictions. The committee published its very detailed report and recommendations in December last.</P>
    <P>I am on record as welcoming the broad thrust of the committee's recommendations for the establishment of a judicial council which would have functions in the area of judicial conduct and ethics and judicial studies and publications. This is the history of the developments which have led to the proposal we are considering today. In bringing forward this proposal and in putting this particular wording before the House, I have drawn on the very valuable work of the three groups to which I have referred and which have already considered these issues in depth. It is my duty as Minister, on behalf of the Government, to act on those reports and to deal with the issues raised. The philosophy underlying this Bill is that, first, it must provide for fair and workable measures to deal with judicial misbehaviour which serve to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice and, second, it must maintain and support the independence of judges in carrying out their duties. An appropriate balance must exist between these two objectives. I suggest we debate the Bill with reference to these essential criteria.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the proposed new constitutional provisions as set out in the Schedule to the Bill <Col N="559" /> on which it is proposed that the people should be asked to vote. The new Article 35.4 is framed in specific yet simple terms. It would allow for the establishment by law of a body to investigate, or cause to be investigated, whether persons, while holding the office of judge, engaged in conduct constituting misbehaviour or were affected by incapacity and to make and publish findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>A question which immediately arises is whether we need to have such a provision in the Constitution at all. While it may well be possible to establish such a body by Act of the Oireachtas without amending the Constitution, there is a common view that constitutional provision is warranted. The Constitution Review Group was of the opinion that, lest there be any concern that the Oireachtas might be precluded from legislating for some form of disciplinary control of the Judiciary, Article 35 should be amended to provide for such a possibility. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution also recommended that the judicial council it envisaged should have a foundation in the Constitution. I believe the House would readily support that approach as being the best way forward on the issue.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is generally in line with the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. Detailed legislation will be required to establish the body and to determine its composition, powers and <i>modus operandi</i>. It is appropriate, in making this proposal to amend the Constitution, that I should outline in a general way what my approach will be to the subsequent legislation required to implement the new Article 35.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>With necessary modifications, the recommendations of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics provide a very good basis for the legislative proposals which will be required to follow through on the proposed constitutional amendment. In other words, I envisage that the legislation which will be introduced will provide for much of the structure recommended by the judicial committee &ndash; a judicial council of which all serving judges will be members, a board and staffing for the council and sub-committees, one of which will be a judicial behaviour and ethics committee which will correspond to the body referred to in the proposed new section 4 of Article 35. It will be specifically empowered to undertake the investigation of complaints of misbehaviour or incapacity on the part of judges and to report and make recommendations in that regard, as is provided for in the proposed constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>This new constitutional body will be conferred with all the necessary powers to investigate complaints or to appoint a person or body to carry out an investigation on its behalf. It is important to note that, whether the body asks a person or other group to carry out the investigation, it is the <Col N="560" /> body itself which remains responsible for making findings and recommendations and publishing them if it so decides.</P>

      <P>On the composition of the body, the Constitution Review Group envisaged a mechanism for the regulation by judges themselves of judicial conduct while the all-party committee favoured having a lay element on the proposed judicial council and its sub-committees. The Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics recommended that there should be a judicial council, of which all judges would be members, and that it would carry out its functions through the agency of a board and a number of committees, one of which would deal with judicial behaviour and ethics. This committee would refer complaints which warranted further investigation to panels of inquiry. There would be lay representation only at the panel of inquiry level.</P>
      <P>While accepting the recommendations of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics as a good basis for the type of structure we should establish, we should provide for a greater role for lay people. Therefore, the provision in the Bill we are now considering requires that the body in question must include judges and persons who are not judges or former judges. In this way, lay persons will be members of the body which, under the Constitution, has responsibility for investigating judicial conduct or causing it to be investigated.</P>
      <P>The proposed new section 4.4 of Article 35 of the Constitution would require that an investigation into a judge's behaviour or possible incapacity be conducted by a judge or by persons a majority of whom are judges. This means that a majority of the body itself must be judges, as must a majority of any panel it asks to conduct an investigation. This is the key guarantee of judicial independence as far as the operation of this body would be concerned and it closely reflects the conclusions reached by the three groups which have considered this question, namely, the Constitution Review Group, the all-party Oireachtas committee and the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of both the all-party Oireachtas committee and the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics, the proposed body will not have power to impose penalties or any kind of legal sanction on a judge. These committees recommended &ndash; and I agree with their recommendation &ndash; that in all but serious instances of misbehaviour, the body would have only moral force to admonish or to seek to correct the misbehaviour identified. This is encompassed in the power in Part 2, section 4.1 to make recommendations.</P>

      <P>Obviously, where serious complaints are upheld, this would normally follow a public inquiry and the publication of a report and, if the body decided this was warranted, it could recommend the impeachment of the judge. This would then be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In discussing this issue, it is helpful to recall the findings of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on the subject. The committee drew a distinction between legal and moral sanctions. Legal sanctions are penalties imposed by law and moral sanctions are psychological pressures imposed by society. I would add to that, in the present context, that such pressures are pressures which, under this proposal, will be imposed by a group consisting of the judge's peers on the Bench and respected lay persons. The all-party Oireachtas committee did not favour legal sanctions for its proposed judicial council but stated its existence and operations would provide it with moral sanctions. The weight of such sanctions would, in the committee's view, depend on the sensibility of society in general and the Judiciary as a group in particular. The committee believed the establishment of a judicial council would provide a major underpinning for the development and maintenance of a strong culture of judicial accountability. In this respect, the proposal we are debating today follows the approach advocated by the all-party Oireachtas committee and I am confident it will have the beneficial effect foreseen by the committee.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the second element in the proposal in the Bill, that is, the provision on removal from office. As I have already said, the proposed new Article 35.5 provides that judges may be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity by means of the procedure which, with some essential modifications, would apply to the President. The main features of the new section 5 are as follows. The impeachment procedure will apply to all judges, not just to judges of the Supreme and High Courts as at present. A charge against a judge must be preferred by either House of the Oireachtas and the proposal to prefer a charge must be made by a notice of motion in writing signed by not fewer than 30 members. When a charge has been preferred by either House, the other House must investigate the charge or cause it to be investigated by any court, tribunal or other body. The reference to &ldquo;court, tribunal or other body&rdquo; in section 5.7 is derived from Article 13.8.2 of the Constitution which, in effect, makes similar provision in respect of the impeachment of a President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House which prefers the charge may also decide that the judge concerned shall not exercise judicial functions until such time as that House may determine by another resolution. If the charge against the judge has not been sustained in the investigating House, he or she may resume the exercise of judicial functions. A judge who is charged shall have the right to appear and be represented at the investigation. If the investigat<Col N="562" /> ing House declares that the charge has been sustained and the misbehaviour or incapacity in question is such as to render the judge unfit to continue in office, the Taoiseach shall notify the President who shall remove the judge from office. All decisions made by the Houses under this section will require a two thirds majority, that is, the decision to prefer a charge, suspend a judge, lift a suspension and declare that the charge has been sustained.</P>
    <P>The principle on which the new section is based is that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the only institutions which can decide that a judge should be removed from office. They may take such a decision on foot of a recommendation of the body provided for in the new Article 35.4 but they may also proceed on their own initiative without such a recommendation. The supremacy of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this area is, therefore, preserved in my proposal. What the proposed provision does, however, is to provide a far better procedure for taking decisions on removal from office by addressing the defects identified by the Constitution Review Group which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>In explaining to the House the features of the new section, I will deal first with the requirement for a two thirds majority for impeachment since this has been the subject of a certain amount of public comment. The argument of the Constitution Review Group that a two thirds majority in the House should be necessary to remove a judge from office is, I believe, the correct way forward. It effectively removes the possibility that such a decision could be taken solely with the support of Government parties and against the wishes of the Opposition. I would invite Deputies who may think otherwise to reflect on how undesirable it would be if such a possibility were to come to pass.</P>
    <P>We must also consider this issue in the light of the doctrine of the separation of powers which is a central feature of our Constitution. As far back as 1947, in the case of Buckley <i>versus</i> the Attorney General [1950 IR 67], the High Court, invoking the doctrine of the separation of powers, ruled as unconstitutional an attempt by the Oireachtas to interfere in an action which was already before the court. The Supreme Court upheld this decision citing Article 6 of the Constitution. The court held that the manifest object of this Article was to recognise and ordain that, in this State, all powers of government should be exercised in accordance with the well recognised principle of the distribution of powers between the Legislature, Executive and judicial organs of the State and to require that these powers should not be exercised otherwise. The court went on to say that the effect of Article 6 and Articles 34 to 37 is to vest in the courts the exclusive right to determine justiciable controversies between citizens or citizens, as the case may be, and the State.</P>
    <P>This principle implies that those who are charged with the exercise of judicial powers, namely, judges, must be independent in the dis<Col N="563" /> charge of their duties. Article 35.2 of the Constitution provides that all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and shall be subject only to the Constitution and the law. Judges must be able to administer justice without fear or favour and without interference from the Executive or legislative branches of Government. In defence of this independence, judges are, for example, ineligible under the Constitution for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas and may not hold any office or position of emolument other than that of judge.</P>
    <P>Even the perception that a judge could be removed from office in the absence of a broad level of consensus among Members of the Oireachtas would, in my view, be detrimental to the concept of an independent Judiciary and the doctrine of the separation of powers. That independence would be damaged by the possibility that a Government might use its majority in the Houses to bring about the removal of a judge from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe people would want the possibility of judges' independence being compromised in this way.</P>
      <P>A significant feature of my proposal is that the impeachment procedure will apply to all judges and not just to judges of the Supreme and High Courts, which is the position under the present constitutional provision. For the information of the House, there are statutory provisions which, at present, give judges of the lower courts the same security of tenure as judges of the Supreme and High Courts, that is, they can only be removed from office by the same procedure. What my proposal will now do is give explicitly to all judges security of tenure at the constitutional level. I believe this is the appropriate course of action.</P>
      <P>Security of tenure is already effectively guaranteed to judges of the lower courts at constitutional level because any amendment to the existing statutory provisions on their security of tenure, which negatively affected their independence as judges, would implicitly be constitutionally invalid.</P>
      <P>It is notable that, apart from the removal from office provision, the rest of Article 35 of the Constitution refers to all judges. I also believe, in support of my proposal, that as judges of the lower courts are now invariably lawyers of long standing and such courts have no lay members, it is appropriate that they should be treated the same as the judges of the Supreme and High Courts. Their independence in carrying out their judicial functions is no different and no less important, particularly to the members of the public who seek justice in their courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth dwelling on the contribution the judges of the Circuit and District Courts have <Col N="564" /> made to our courts system over the years. The Circuit Court has a pivotal role in our courts structure and has substantial responsibilities. Sitting with a judge and jury, it has full jurisdiction in very serious criminal offences. The Circuit Court has been conferred with an increasing role in civil matters in recent years. The Oireachtas has vested in that court additional responsibilities in areas such as employment, planning, judicial separation, nullity of marriage and divorce. Last year, the Circuit Court made very significant progress in reducing the waiting time for the hearing of civil actions and the efforts of the Circuit Court judges must be acknowledged in that regard. In the recently published Courts and Court Officers Bill, the general civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is being increased to 100,000 or almost £80,000&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;which will see significant devolution of cases from the High Court to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The District Court also has a very heavy workload. It carries out a vital role in the criminal justice area, including the liberty of the individual. In civil matters, our district judges carry out very important statutory functions in a highly professional and efficient way. More recently, in the area of small claims, they have provided the consumer with an extremely speedy and inexpensive service. The civil jurisdiction of the court is being increased to 20,000 or almost £16,000 under the Courts and Court Officers Bill.</P>

      <P>All of this reinforces my view that the judges of the Circuit and District Courts should be given exactly the same security of tenure under the Constitution as the judges of the superior courts and that any distinction in that regard between the two sets of judges would not be justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant addition to the impeachment power in the proposed section 5 as compared with the provision which applies in the case of the President under Article 12.10 is that the House which prefers the charge may, if it deems fit, require the judge concerned not to exercise his or her judicial functions until such time as that House determines otherwise or until the charge has not been sustained following the investigation by the other House. The reason for this provision is that, in some circumstances, it could be seriously injurious to the administration of justice if a person against whom a charge of misbehaviour or incapacity has been made were to continue to exercise the functions of a judge while an investigation, which may take some time, is under way. This need not be the case in relation to every judge charged under this section &ndash; it will depend on the circumstances and will be at the discretion <Col N="565" /> of the House acting on a two thirds majority. In the light of any alterations in circumstances, the House may also decide to lift the suspension. If the charge is not sustained before the investigating House, the judge will be free to return to the exercise of his or her functions.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, impeachment proceedings might arise out of an investigation by the body provided for by the new section 4 but they could also arise at the initiative of either House. Where the Article 35.4 body has investigated misbehaviour and issued a report recommending impeachment, the question arises as to whether the investigating House of the Oireachtas can accept that report and act on it. That a comprehensive report is already available to the House could well have the effect of shortening the investigation which the House needs to undertake or cause to have undertaken but there can be no question of the House being circumscribed in how it carries out its role. In any event, the judge has to be given the opportunity of responding to the charge against him or her, including the findings of the Article 35.4 body. This is an inevitable implication of the supremacy of the Houses in this matter. The decision that a judge should be removed from office cannot be devolved in whole or in part to another body.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution identified the following advantages of an impeachment procedure such as I am now proposing: there is a clear division of function between the Houses; there is a clear distinction between charge and hearing; the charge must be initiated by a minimum number of members and the right of the charged party to appear and be represented at the hearing of the charge is given clear recognition.</P>
    <P>I have outlined for the House the central elements of the proposal which the Government wishes to put before the people and the reasoning underlying them. They represent a package which amounts to major reform in respect of judicial accountability when compared with the present situation and they preserve and enhance the independence of our Judiciary. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has been published by the Government as a consequence of the Sheedy affair and the controversy which resulted in the resignation of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty from the Supreme Court and Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly from the High Court. At the time of the Sheedy affair, considerable public attention focused on the current constitutional provisions concerning the impeachment of members of the Judiciary. In 1996, the Constitution Review Group published a report which recommended the replacement of the current constitutional provision with a more elaborate measure. Subsequent to the Sheedy affair, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its own report on the issue and in December last, a report <Col N="566" /> was published by the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael will oppose the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, on Second Stage in this House. It is widely acknowledged that there is need to enact new constitutional provisions in regard to judicial misbehaviour or incapacity and the powers of impeachment. However, the approach taken to date by the Government is substantially flawed and the Bill before the House is fundamentally defective. Instead of facilitating the impeachment of members of the Judiciary alleged to have seriously misbehaved, it will erect constitutional barriers to impeachment which will render the impeachment procedure practically redundant.</P>
      <P>The new provisions proposed to be included in a new Article 35.4 of the Constitution provide for the establishment of a body to investigate allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity of members of the Judiciary while holding the office of judge. While the Government's referendum Bill provides that membership of this body &ldquo;shall include judges and one or more persons who are not judges or former judges&rdquo;, it does not state how many members of the Judiciary are to form this body, who is to be responsible for appointing members of the Judiciary to this body, who is to be responsible for appointing one or more persons who are not judges to it, what factors will render a judge eligible for appointment to the body or a non-judge eligible for appointment to the body or how long will either a member of the Judiciary or a non-judicial person hold such membership. The Minister attempted to clarify some aspects of this but not in a way that is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The new Article 35.4, while envisaging investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct which occurred during the time a person held the office of judge, excludes from its remit allegations of misbehaviour by a judge prior to his or her appointment to the Judiciary, even where such misbehaviour would clearly render a person unsuitable to continue in office as a judge. For example, under this provision, should it emerge that prior to a person being appointed a judge, he or she engaged in major tax evasion, proof of such conduct would be outside the investigative remit of this new proposed body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new body will also be something of a toothless tiger. While it is envisaged that it will constitutionally be empowered &ldquo;to make and publish findings and recommendations&rdquo;, there is no constitutional provision to enable it to reprimand a judge who has misbehaved where such reprimand would be appropriate due to the nature of the misbehaviour and where impeachment would be too severe a remedy. Yet, when the Minister first announced his intention to publish this Bill and upon its publication, he stated that the new investigative body he proposed to establish to investigate misbehaviour by a judge will, where appropriate, be empowered to reprimand a judge. Although the Minister may intend that <Col N="567" /> the new proposed body be enabled by legislation to issue reprimands, it is not conferred with any constitutional capacity to do so and is confined under the new Article 35.4 to publishing findings and recommendations. This has not to date been adequately explained by the Minister nor was it adequately explained by him in his contribution to this House. Today the Minister dropped all reference to reprimands and has instead stated that &ldquo;the proposed body would have only moral force to admonish or to seek to correct the misbehaviour found.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the absence of proper constitutional provision which expressly confers on this new body a power to issue reprimands or to admonish, the Fine Gael Party does not believe this body will be able to so act. Legislation which empowered it to reprimand or admonish a judge would clearly violate the constitutional function of such body as established under the Constitution and any such legislation could be held unconstitutional. The new proposed Article 35.4 varies from the recommendation contained in the Report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics published in December 2000 which stated that powers to reprimand should be conferred on any new judicial disciplinary body established. This committee also proposed the establishment by statute of a judicial council with substantially broader powers than those being constitutionally conferred on the body envisaged in the Referendum Bill. A similar proposal was made by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. A constitutional provision for the establishment of a judicial council should have been contained in this Bill but has inexplicably been omitted by the Minister. He has now promised the enactment of legislation at a later date to establish such a council. If it is genuinely his intention to establish such a council, it should be given a constitutional status.</P>
    <P>Last summer, Fine Gael's policy document entitled &ldquo;A Democratic Revolution&rdquo; proposed the establishment of a judicial board, the functions of which will be similar to the judicial council proposed by the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics in its December 2000 report. Fine Gael is committed to the establishment of such a body, consisting of the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts. We also proposed that there be appointed as advisory members to the board, the President of the Law Society, the Chairman of the Bar Council, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman. In addition, the President of Ireland, we proposed, should appoint four members of the Council of State to the board as advisory members who would neither be former or current Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas nor the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The proposal that such appointment be made by the President of Ireland was to preserve the concept of the separation of powers and the non-interference by the Government of the day with <Col N="568" /> members of the Judiciary, while allowing for making appointments of members to such board also independent of the Judiciary itself. The Fine Gael proposal provided for an equal number of legal and non-legal members under the chairmanship of the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The board Fine Gael proposed would monitor and address overall issues relating to the administration of our justice system and judicial conduct such as ethics; efficiency; consistency; regard for sentences and awards in other courts of the State and in other jurisdictions; personal demeanour; common sense; hours and days of work; complaints; training and re-training; research; staffing and other facilities. The judicial board or council proposed by Fine Gael would be empowered to seek reports from the Chief Justice or the President of the appropriate court, or, when necessary, from an individual judge on any issue of concern that arose under any of these headings. It is regrettable that the Government has not used this Bill as a vehicle to establish by way of constitutional provision such judicial council or board.</P>
    <P>The new Article 35.4 provides for the enactment of legislation to confer &ldquo;all necessary powers by law on the body, person or persons conducting an investigation&rdquo; as envisaged by the article. This Bill, dated 27 March, was only published and distributed to Members of this House on Thursday, 29 March. Thus, it was published less than two weeks ago. The legislation envisaged by Article 35.4 should have been published in draft form by the Government at the same time as this Bill and both proposals should have been published and available for public debate and discussion at least four weeks prior to the commencement in the House of this Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in the new proposed Articles 35.4 and 35.5, which I will refer to shortly, effect a fundamental change in the approach by this State and under our Constitution to the issues of judicial misconduct and incapacity. It is totally inappropriate that the legislative process commence in this House until the detail of the Bill has been in the public domain for sufficient time to enable its proposals to be given detailed consideration. It is scandalous that a constitutional amendment, the effectiveness of which is dependent on the enactment of legislation by this House, should be published and that a Second Stage debate should commence in this House without the detail of the additional substantive legislation required to give effect to the new article being publicly available.</P>
    <P>It was originally the Government's intention to enact all Stages of the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, this week. It was only as a consequence of the opposition to this approach voiced by both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that the completion of the legislative process will not take place until after Easter. Prior to the resumption after Easter of the Second Stage debate in this House, Fine Gael <Col N="569" /> calls on the Government to publish in draft form the legislation it proposes to enact should the new Article 35.4 be included in the Constitution as a consequence of the holding of a referendum.</P>
    <P>The new Article 35.5 which the same referendum Bill envisages should be included in the Constitution deals with the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas to impeach a member of the Judiciary for stated misbehaviour or incapacity. Under the current constitutional provisions, a member of the Judiciary can be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity by a resolution proposed by a Member of each House and passed by a majority vote in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. Under the new provisions, a proposal to prefer a charge of misbehaviour or incapacity against a judge cannot be entertained unless a notice of motion in writing is signed by not less than 30 Members of either the Seanad or the Dáil and such charge cannot be considered and investigated by either House of the Oireachtas unless a resolution is passed by not less than two thirds of the total membership of either House calling for such allegation to be investigated. Instead of facilitating the proper investigation by a House of the Oireachtas of alleged judicial misbehaviour or incapacity these provisions erect an unnecessary barrier to the commencement of any such investigation.</P>
    <P>The Government has to date failed to explain the reasoning behind the proposal that a motion preferring a charge against a judge in either the Dáil or the Seanad to be entertained should require the signature of at least 30 Members of either House. This issue was not even addressed by the Minister in his contribution. At present, such motion can be tabled by a single Member. Whilst it may be argued it should not be possible for a single Member to table a motion of such seriousness, which could result in a crisis of public confidence in a member of the Judiciary, there is no reason the tabling of such a motion should require a minimum of 30 signatories which, in the case of a motion being brought before the Seanad, would require the support of a minimum of one half of the existing Members of that House.</P>
    <P>Why should it not prove possible for a motion signed by either ten, 15 or 20 Members of either House of the Oireachtas to be entertained, debated and voted on? The reality is that this part of the new proposed Article 35.5 simply slavishly adapts to the impeachment of members of the Judiciary procedures prescribed in 1937 by the Constitution for the impeachment of the President of Ireland without any detailed analysis of the desirability or otherwise of members of the Judiciary being placed in an identical constitutional position concerning allegations of misconduct to that of the President.</P>
    <P>In criticising the inadequacy of the existing constitutional provision for the impeachment of members of the Judiciary, both the Constitution review group and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution proposed we adopt the 30 Member <Col N="570" /> signatory rule without either report containing any detailed analysis of the constraints the inclusion of such a rule in our Constitution may impose on either House of the Oireachtas properly considering whether or not to investigate allegations of judicial misbehaviour or incapacity.</P>
    <P>The Constitution review group recommended that an investigation of alleged judicial misbehaviour or incapacity should only be undertaken upon a resolution for such investigation being supported by a vote of two thirds of the Members of either House of the Oireachtas. The all-party committee rejected the two thirds requirement and proposed that a simple majority vote should facilitate the commencement of such investigation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that if a serious allegation is made against a member of the Judiciary, which a majority of Members of either the Dáil or the Seanad believe should be investigated, the public interest demands that such investigation occur. No reasonable argument can be made that for an investigation to be conducted, there should be a vote supported by two thirds of the Members of either House. If a majority of Members is short of two thirds vote for such investigation, the position of the member of the Judiciary concerned would become untenable, but the impeachment investigation could not take place. Fine Gael is totally opposed to this provision and believes that a resolution supported by a simple majority of the House should be sufficient to commence an impeachment investigation.</P>
    <P>If the new proposed amendment relating to judicial impeachment had been contained in the Constitution at the time of the Sheedy affair, does anyone doubt that Fianna Fáil would have used its position in this House to prevent an investigation into that affair by the House or a committee of this House? There is a serious suspicion that the 30 Member rule proposed in the Bill for a motion &ldquo;preferring a charge against a judge&rdquo; taken together with the imposition of the two thirds majority barrier to an investigation of judicial misconduct or incapacity is designed by the Government not to facilitate either House of the Oireachtas addressing issues of judicial misconduct or incapacity, but to ensure that, should there in future be a repetition of the Sheedy affair, both Houses of the Oireachtas and Oireachtas committees are rendered politically impotent to address the consequences of any such affair.</P>

      <P>Following one House of the Oireachtas agreeing that an allegation of judicial misconduct or incapacity should be investigated, the Bill provides that a resolution declaring that the charge preferred against a judge has been sustained requires support from not less than two thirds of the total membership of the other House. The committee appointed to review the Constitution, which published its report in 1996, <Col N="571" /> proposed that the dismissal and impeachment of a judge should require a two thirds majority of the House.</P>
      <P>Whilst the All-Party Committee on the Constitution proposed that for an impeachment resolution to be successful, only a simple majority should be required. Under the current Constitution, only a simple majority is required for impeachment and since the enactment of the 1937 Constitution, there has been no suggestion that this provision has been abused by any Government. However, there is a possibility that a judicial dismissal could be effected by a simple majority in the future in circumstances in which Opposition parties regarded it as completely inappropriate that a judge be dismissed from office and were concerned that the Government of the day for politically partisan reasons was abusing its majority support in either the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the view that the resolution to dismiss a judge by either House of the Oireachtas should require a two thirds majority in the interests of maintaining the independence of the Judiciary and upholding the concept of separation of powers. The fundamental flaw in the referendum Bill results from the Government's failure to recognise the different principles that should apply to either House of the Oireachtas first determining that an allegation of misconduct be investigated compared to a subsequent determination that the allegation has been sustained and that the alleged misbehaviour or incapacity is such as to render the judge unfit to continue in office.</P>
      <P>I referred to the fact that where an investigation is conducted by the new proposed judicial body under Article 35.4, the behaviour of the judge prior to being appointed to the Judiciary cannot be investigated. Under the new Article 35.5, it appears misbehaviour by a person prior to judicial appointment can be the subject of impeachment by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister should explain the reason for this inconsistency. If a person appointed as a judge is guilty of some minor misconduct prior to such appointment, why should that not fail to be investigated by the new body that is to be created and why should the only constitutional remedy available to address the issue be the route of impeachment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other major difficulties with regard to this proposed constitutional amendment. Where judicial misbehaviour or incapacity is being investigated under the new proposed Article 35.4, the body investigating it is conferred with no authority to suspend the judge under investigation. Where a charge is preferred against a judge under the new proposed Article 35.5, which could result in impeachment should either House of the Oireachtas decide the allegation needs to be investigated, the judge concerned can be suspended from office but only if a two thirds majority of the House so vote. The body envis<Col N="572" /> aged under the new proposed Article 35.4 should have a constitutional power of suspension. Under the new proposed Article 35.5, judicial suspension should be effected automatically upon either House of the Oireachtas by a majority voting for an investigation of alleged misconduct or incapacity to take place.</P>
    <P>The new proposed constitutional Articles do not clarify the interaction between the new body proposed by the Minister and the impeachment powers of the Oireachtas. If the new proposed body determines that an allegation of judicial misconduct is unfounded, will that exclude either House of the Oireachtas from further investigating such an allegation? Where the body makes recommendations as a consequence of an investigation, what relevance will such recommendations have should either House of the Oireachtas commence an impeachment procedure? Where either House of the Oireachtas undertakes the impeachment procedure in circumstances where a member of the Judiciary for the same alleged misconduct or incapacity was investigated by the new body envisaged under Article 35.4, will the members of that body who conducted the investigation be required to come before the House of the Oireachtas considering impeachment to give evidence of their investigative process and to explain any recommendations made? These and other questions need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party recognises the need for new constitutional and legislative provisions with regard to the Judiciary. As stated in our document, Democratic Revolution, the Fine Gael Party committed itself in Government to the formation of a judicial board with a substantial remit to address a broad range of issues that affect the Judiciary and impact on the public. It also proposed the enactment of legislation containing new provisions for impeachment and for the imposition of lesser penalties and disciplinary procedures where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party's Courts Bill, 2000, which the Government voted down last autumn, also sought to provide for a new approach with regard to the making of judicial appointments. We proposed that upon the Government deciding on a nominee to a vacant judicial office, the name of the person proposed should be submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights for its consideration. The Bill proposed that the committee hold public hearings on any such nomination and that it furnish its opinion on the nomination to the Government and that such opinion be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. This proposal was designed to ensure proper accountability by Government to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the appointment of members of the Judiciary and to afford Members of the Oireachtas a forum within which the suitability of proposed judicial appointees could be considered. The Fine Gael Party's proposal was essentially designed to redress the current democratic deficit in the mak<Col N="573" /> ing of judicial appointments. Unfortunately, the Government voted this measure down. The need for greater transparency in this area is widely acknowledged and should have been provided for either under this constitutional referendum Bill or could be provided for in the additional legislation envisaged by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires substantial revision and its envisaged workings need comprehensive clarification. Any proposal by the Government which renders it more difficult to impeach a judge for misbehaviour or for incapacity to perform his or her duties should be treated by the public with great suspicion. The Government has failed to adequately explain why it should require a minimum of 30 Members of either House to propose an impeachment motion or a majority of two thirds of the Members to facilitate the commencement of an impeachment process and the investigation of alleged misbehaviour or incapacity. The Government has also been grossly derelict in its duty by publishing a constitutional proposal to establish a new judicial disciplinary body while, at the same time, failing to publish in draft form the legislation it envisages enacting to provide a structure for that body and to detail the powers it can exercise in investigating members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party will oppose the Bill on Second Stage and if the Bill is not amended in a manner we deem appropriate and the outstanding draft legislation prescribing a framework with which we agree is not published, we shall oppose the incorporation of these new provisions in our Constitution upon a referendum taking place and calling on the public to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal is that the referendum on the new proposed Articles 35.4 and 35.5 of the Constitution should be put to the people in conjunction with the referendum on the Nice Treaty, the referendum to abolish capital punishment and the referendum on the International Criminal Court. The proposals on judicial misbehaviour and incapacity have been unnecessarily rushed into the House and are contained in a Bill for which the Government has to date failed to even publish an explanatory memorandum. It is noteworthy that explanatory memoranda in relation to the referendum Bills concerning the Nice Treaty and the International Criminal Court have been published. The Fine Gael Party has already called for the referendum on the Nice Treaty to be held on a separate day to any of the other referendum proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government is obliged to make arrangements for a public information campaign concerning all four referendum proposals and, under the McKenna judgment, to provide funding for the publication of documentation arguing in favour and against each proposal. Bizarrely, the judgment in the McKenna case requires the Government to provide funding for the publication of reasons to encourage the public to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the establishment of an international criminal court. It also requires the Government to <Col N="574" /> fund the arguments for and against the proposed constitutional changes relating to allegations of judicial misbehaviour and incapacity and to impeachment of members of the Judiciary. This issue is so complex and the proposals of the Government are so ill-conceived that putting it to the people in a referendum should be postponed and should not coincide with the referendum on the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>To coincide these referenda will inevitably result in substantial public confusion and could damage the possibility of a successful outcome to the referendum on Nice. As Opposition parties in this House which will call for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on the Nice Treaty will call for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on the restrictions the Government proposes to introduce on the impeachment of judges under the Bill in its current form, there is a substantial risk that the different campaigns relating to each of the different proposals will cause a great deal of public confusion. The proposed referendum on the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill should be postponed. After it has completed Second Stage, it should be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for the holding of public hearings on the proposals contained in it and for the processing and amendment by that committee of this Bill. Essential changes need to be made because the legislation is fundamentally flawed.</P>

      <P>In June, which is only a few weeks away, the Government wants the people to vote on four proposals to change the Constitution. Two of the proposals are relatively innocuous &ndash; one relates to the formal abolition of the death penalty while the other is a proposal to enable jurisdiction to be exercised by the International Criminal Court. These two proposals deserve our support. The point the two measures have in common is that they are essentially addressed to other countries to which they are more directly relevant. Neither will have great domestic impact after they are passed; nobody has been executed in this jurisdiction. However, Ireland will be able to hold its head high on the international stage and claim that it has practised what it has preached because our national laws are in accordance with the standards we call on others to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thrown in with these two uncontentious measures are referenda on the Nice Treaty and on judicial conduct, the Bill to enable which is before the House. The Labour Party has already asked that the referendum on the Treaty of Nice be postponed until the autumn. It needs full and frank debate. The majorities in favour of successive European referenda have reduced as the issues have become more technical and the public has become increasingly disinclined to wade through the obscure maze of cross-referenced jargon that now characterises what we still like to describe as the European project. Anyone who has read the Treaty of Nice will know it is unreadable because it cross-references all previous treaties. We have learned in putting these referenda <Col N="575" /> to the people that we cannot take the public for granted any longer. This means, at European level, making clarity and simplicity an essential component at the heart of the treaty-making process. In the immediate context of Nice, it means we must not rush our fences.</P>
    <P>The Bill dealing with the referendum on judicial conduct also needs much more thought than has gone into it to date. I have already made clear my strong belief that this measure is ill-thought out, restrictive and deeply flawed. Unless it is radically changed on Committee Stage in this House, it should be rejected by the electorate since its net effect is to make what is by consensus an unsatisfactory situation even worse.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that a proposal as ill-thought out as this should be rushed through the Oireachtas. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution now argues in favour of a rule that 90 days should elapse between the publication of a constitutional amendment Bill and its passage through the Houses. It is the view of the committee that there should be 90 days to reflect on changes in our basic law. It also believes a further 90 days should elapse between the passing of the Bill and polling day. That clearly will not happen in this case. That committee, the Constitution Review Group prior to that, the Hamilton committee on judicial conduct and ethics and, presumably, the Government have had weeks if not months to consider and tease out the issues that arise in the context of judicial conduct. I find it nothing less than offensive for the Minister to say these bodies have had months to tease out the matter and, by definition, Members of the House should act as ciphers or rubber stamps for them. The Minister's view is an incredibly arrogant one and is an insult to the proper standing of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The issues which arise are of fundamental importance. They relate to the balance that must be struck between the safeguarding of an independent Judiciary from political interference and the need for a workable system of public accountability for all those, including judges, who serve in public office. That wind of change is unanswerable. It blows through membership of the House and anyone who serves the public in any capacity. Judges are no more immune from that wind of change than anyone else. It goes without saying that, in the vast majority of cases, judges have served this country well since the foundation of the State, sometimes at great personal risk to themselves and their families. However, judges cannot be allowed to operate in an untouchable ivory tower. It is bad for the citizen and for the Judiciary. The most important judge in the country, the Chief Justice, Mr. Ronan Keane, has recognised this fact and supports reform.</P>
    <P>The task, therefore, is to introduce a system whereby judges will be required to adhere to basic standards while maintaining judicial independence. The public must have confidence that a genuine complaint will receive fair and rigorous investigation and that, if a member of the <Col N="576" /> Judiciary is found to have misbehaved, it is possible that sanctions might be capable of being imposed. Each of us in our working lives has certain standards to live up to. Judges are no different and, given the effect their decisions have on the lives of citizens every day of the week, it is vital citizens have confidence in the quality of justice dispensed in courts.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the need for a procedure to deal with judicial conduct became obvious following the premature release from prison of Mr. Philip Sheedy who had been convicted and imprisoned for dangerous driving causing the death of Mrs. Anne Ryan in Tallaght in 1996. As the House knows, he was sentenced to four years in prison. However, Philip Sheedy received an early and entirely unorthodox review of his sentence and was released after serving just 12 months. The early release of Philip Sheedy was a devastating blow to the family of Mrs. Ryan. Opposition politicians and the public demanded an inquiry. Two senior judges, Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly, resigned as a result.</P>
    <P>Although ultimately these two senior judges resigned as a result of a non-statutory inquiry into the affair conducted by the previous Chief Justice, the full facts have never emerged. I was a member of the committee of the House that tried to discover those facts. Unfortunately, we were thwarted by a vote of the Government parties. It is precisely because the inquiry was non-statutory that it was incomplete.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the problem was the reluctance of the Government to get to the bottom of the Sheedy affair. However, on a constitutional level, the system of judicial accountability was shown to be unworkable. The problem is caused, at least in part, by the text of the Constitution. The power to impeach a judge is specified, but the Constitution is silent on the process required to achieve that end. As the Ceann Comhairle pointed out in his letter to the leaders of the parties in the House on 20 April 1999:</P>
    <P>Given that in any exercise of its constitutional function under Article 35.4, the Dáil itself is in judicial mode with its concomitant responsibility for impartiality and adherence to fair procedures and natural and constitutional justice, there is an onus on the Dáil to ensure as far as possible that the procedures to be adopted not alone meet the highest standards required but that the actions taken by the Dáil in passing any such resolution (including any preliminary steps undertaken to that end) are not open to successful legal challenge . . .</P>
    <P>He went on later in the same letter to point out that:</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged, e.g. Report of the Constitutional Review Group, 1996, that the impeachment process set out in Article 35.4 (i.e. apart from the wording of the paragraph itself which could create difficulties of interpretation) would need to be improved to <Col N="577" /> correspond with modern requirements of fair procedure . . .</P>
    <P>The problem is that the current text does not provide for any procedure to be observed prior to passing the envisaged resolutions in both Houses. Yet if resolutions were passed without due process, they would be liable to be struck down.</P>
    <P>The framers of the Constitution made the mistake of borrowing a procedure from the constitutional framework in place at Westminster, where this difficulty does not arise. As the Houses of Parliament in the United Kingdom claim descent from and the inherent jurisdiction and powers of a court of law, they have power to conduct any form of inquiry they see fit while being immune from review by the ordinary courts. In this country matters are more complicated.</P>
    <P>Among the other problems which arose, we had an individual who, while still serving as a judge, volunteered to appear before an Oireachtas committee to explain his role in the Sheedy affair, but once he had resigned from that office he declined to do so on the grounds that this was prevented by the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence. No one was sure whether his claim was sustainable and, as there was no precedent, no one knew what to do next. Despite the argument that the Houses of the Oireachtas were entitled to confer powers on the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to conduct a sworn inquiry for the purposes of considering the removal of a judge from office, it was extremely doubtful whether powers could be conferred to compel the judge in question to attend once he or she had resigned. Judicial independence would have been impinged upon for no constitutionally mandated purpose. The Bill, at least, has the merit of plugging that loophole. It also has the merit of providing for a detailed series of procedural steps to be followed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to safeguard due process and natural justice. The Government's proposals, however, duck the hard issues. The amendment will not give a citizen a real opportunity to seek redress where they are of the view that they have been seriously wronged. It proposes a more conservative and ineffective process than that which obtains and is little more than cowardice dressed up as reform. The proposals will not work and do not deserve the support of the people or this House.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the detail of the Bill which sets out the Government's position on the impeachment process and the establishment of an investigative body into judicial behaviour. While both objectives are desirable, we disagree fundamentally on the path chosen to achieve them. The current position on impeachment is that a simple majority of those present and voting in each House can pass a resolution to remove a judge from office. The Government proposes to change this in order that in future two thirds of the membership of this House, including those absent or abstaining, will be required to do so. The net <Col N="578" /> result is to make it substantially more difficult to remove a judge. It is extraordinary that the Government's principal response to the biggest judicial scandal in the history of the State is to make it more difficult to dismiss a judge. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, says that he wants to guard against the risk of a future Government using its majority in the Houses of the Oireachtas to remove a judge from office for partisan reasons. The reality is that the Houses of the Oireachtas have had such a power since 1922 and, in all that time, it has never been used, much less abused.</P>
    <P>In a wider context, the Houses of Parliament on these islands have had almost identical powers to address the Crown on the dismissal of a superior court judge since the Act of Settlement, 1701. During the course of 300 turbulent years only one judge has been impeached. Politicians are capable of restraint. In that context, how is there any argument for changing 300 years of history to make more impenetrable the barrier to the will of the people being exercised through their elected representatives? It should be borne in mind that a simple majority of both Houses of the Oireachtas is all that is required to declare a state of emergency on foot of which virtually all constitutional safeguards can be set at nought and that a simple majority in the Dáil can vote to declare war on another state. In this wider context, the obsessive desire for the most elaborate protection for judges from the risk of contamination by contact with the body politic is bizarre. It shows no regard for the ultimate truth of our constitutional, legal and political processes, that is, that in this Republic it is the people who are sovereign.</P>
    <P>We, in this House, are the elected representatives of the people and entitled, on their behalf, to call to public account those who hold office in the service of the public. The argument that we must raise the hurdle in order to guard against politically inspired impeachment resolutions being whipped through the Houses of the Oireachtas ignores the reality that the courts are well equipped to protect themselves against unwarranted interference. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is well aware of this. As you indicated, a Cheann Comhairle, in the letter from which I quoted, in such a case the very real risk would be that any departure from the highest standards would leave the House open to a successful legal challenge whereby, albeit in a worst case scenario, the resolution of the Dáil and, presumably, that of the Seanad would be struck down by the courts. As those of us who have served or are about to serve on committees of the House which exercise statutory powers are aware, among the reasons such a resolution would be liable to be struck down would be improper motive, prejudgment of the issues involved or obedience to a party whip. In other words, the Minister is seeking to guard against a course of action that would be unlawful and invalid. In seeking to guard against such an entirely fanciful <Col N="579" /> risk of impeachment inspired and supported on grounds of partisan politics, the Government is opening up the possibility of a new form of constitutional crisis. Let us suppose that the Dáil voted by 100 votes to 50 to remove a judge from office. Does anyone really believe that for the want of the 11 votes needed to secure two thirds of the total membership, the judge concerned could return to the bench as if nothing had happened?</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, what is at issue is the claim of one generation, by simple majority, to outvote the simple majority of a future generation. It argues that, because we are convinced that we are in the right, we should have the right to bind future generations to our way of thinking, even if a majority in the future disagrees. This is fundamentally undemocratic and, rightly, Article 15.11.1 of the Constitution prohibits any attempt, by legislation, to create a requirement for special majorities in the voting arrangements of this House. Why was that done? One cannot create a new requirement whereby to be enacted some measures demand a different majority than others, which is what the Minister wants to do in this case.</P>
    <P>The constitutional safeguard preventing judges from being removed except on grounds of misbehaviour or incapacity is confined to judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court, the two courts created by the Constitution. Judges of the lower courts hold office under statute. The Government proposes that the judges of all courts should only be removable under the new procedure, this new impenetrable barrier, solely for misbehaviour or incapacity. Grounds such as inefficiency or incompetence would be inadequate. I accept that it is a necessary <i>quid pro quo </i>that to safeguard judicial independence it is important that superior court judges who may, as the Minister of State is well aware, decide issues of major controversy against the interests of the Executive are not answerable to the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas on a quotidian basis. Part of the price we pay to secure their independence is that, in their case, we sacrifice normal job performance assessment criteria. We can move to dismiss a High Court or Supreme Court judge only where standards are breached which has serious consequences for public confidence in the administration of justice. For the judges of these two courts, there is the nuclear option of impeachment on grounds of misbehaviour or incapacity but no lesser sanction.</P>
    <P>The Government not only proposes to extend these immunities to cover judges of all the lower courts, it is also making the whole impeachment process much more difficult. In short, there will be less, not more, public accountability. District Court judges will have the same constitutional immunities granted exclusively to one individual under the Constitution, Úachtarán na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Extending the prohibition on removing superior court judges, except by way of impeach<Col N="580" /> ment, to cover the judges of all courts might be acceptable if it was done in the context of introducing a comprehensive system of judicial discipline covering cases falling short of impeachable offences. If the Constitution is to be changed to make it more difficult to remove judges, which, patently, is the proposal of the Government, perhaps an acceptable system could be put in place whereby more limited sanctions could be applied. The Government's proposal, however, is to create an investigative body which further demonstrates that it is unable to tackle these basic issues. The Minister proposes a new judicial conduct committee which will be totally ineffective because it will not be able to take any action against a judge it finds guilty of misbehaviour. It will not even be allowed to consider if a judge is guilty of a less serious charge such as incompetence. At the end of its investigation, under the terms of the constitutional amendment, its constitutional function will be confined to making recommendations and findings of fact. While the terms of the constitutional amendment have been spelled out, we have not seen the legislative proposals. The grounds for an investigation by the new body are confined to cases of misbehaviour or incapacity, the very grounds for which impeachment is the sanction. Lesser charges, therefore, will be outside its remit.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about filling the gap, but his proposals, most certainly, do not fill it. What is to be done once recommendations are made? The Minister is twisting plain English to state that the new judicial conduct committee will be able to admonish somebody. In a recent statement the Minister said that it could direct that they retrain, which would, patently, be unconstitutional. The only actions of the committee that will be constitutional will be the making of findings of fact and recommendations. An admonition is not a recommendation. If the committee recommends that somebody else should admonish someone, who will implement that recommendation? To whom is the committee supposed to make its recommendations since under the Constitution nobody else will be able to sanction a judge? Clearly, the constitutional amendment has been ill-thought out. The Minister is, retrospectively, defying the laws of plain English to justify a concoction of a constitutional amendment that does not merit the support of the people.</P>
    <P>The Hamilton committee proposed the establishment of a body which could impose so-called moral sanctions. Its scheme involved a judicial conduct and ethics committee to consider all questions of judicial conduct and ethics arising in particular cases. The body would have power to issue a private reprimand to a judge, a public reprimand, or recommend to the Attorney General that the Government consider tabling an impeachment resolution.</P>
    <P>The committee included provision for recommendations that a judge be requested to attend courses of counselling or treatment and that the president of a court be requested not to assign <Col N="581" /> duties to a judge for a specified time. It was anxious to describe the sanctions it proposed as moral rather than legal in nature. The vital consideration to bear in mind, however, is that its proposals were drawn up on the basis of no change in constitutional terms. It was attempting to draw up a scheme which could be implemented by ordinary legislation under the Constitution. In that context, it was at pains to indicate that, because it was proposing only moral sanctions:</P>
    <P>the constitutional scheme, under which the only body which can impose legal sanction on a judge is the Oireachtas in the form of a resolution calling for his or her removal, will thus remain unaffected and it could not plausibly be suggested, in our view, that there is any constitutional frailty in the scheme we have proposed.</P>
    <P>The absurdity of the Minister's position is that he has adopted the committee's proposals which it drew up as the furthest it could go in the current constitutional climate, but he is proposing to change the Constitution in order to enable it to do something that it can do already. Why have a referendum on this issue when judges say that there is no need for one? If we want to hold a constitutional referendum &ndash; we need one &ndash; let us do something meaningful. In a series of proposals that I have forwarded to the Minister, the Labour Party has spelled out an alternative scheme. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to spell out the proposals now, but I will do so as soon as a debate on these matters is instituted.</P>
    <P>While no one doubts that judicial accountability is a difficult subject with which to deal &ndash; there are complex constitutional principles involved &ndash; no one can doubt nonetheless that there must be accountability. The O'Flaherty affair did enormous damage to public confidence in the judicial system. People genuinely believed that there was one law for a category who were well connected and another for the ordinary person. Those fears deserved a better response than that provided by the Government. Perhaps the Minister hopes the public memory of the O'Flaherty affair has, as the Tánaiste once hoped, subsided. If he presses this particular set of proposals, however, the Government will be surprised yet again. I hope the Minister will be open to listening to the arguments from this side of the House on which I hope he will engage in debate on Committee Stage. If these flawed and dangerous proposals are put to the people, the Labour Party will do all it can to defeat them.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> I move:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognising the escalating impact of crime on our citizens and recognising, in particular, the continuing and unacceptably high level of murder, gangland shootings, intimidation, drug dealing, joy-riding and public disorder afflicting both urban and rural communities;</P>
    <P>&ndash;believing that crime is demoralising people, terrifying our elderly and destroying the lives of many young people and that to tackle crime we need an efficient and effective police force operating in and with the full confidence, support and co-operation of the population it serves;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledging that the Garda Síochána has served us well since the foundation of the State, that its bravery, particularly in standing up to the threat posed by the IRA and other paramilitaries, must never be forgotten but believing that, like every other organisation, the Garda has to change and evolve, in accordance with principles of accountability and modernisation;</P>
    <P>&ndash;aware that at present the Garda operates under legislation dating back to 1925 and that since society and the demands of policing, have changed radically in the past 75 years, it is therefore time the law governing the Garda changed as well;</P>
    <P>&ndash;affirming that an essential part of that change is the forging of a new relationship between the Garda Síochána and the communities it serves so that those communities are involved in deciding policing priorities in consultation and real partnership with the Garda;</P>
    <P>&ndash;convinced that policing works best when it is based on partnership between local people and the local gardaí and aiming therefore to give ownership of our policing strategy back to the community;</P>
    <P>&ndash;conscious of the danger that, in the absence of such close liaison, paramilitaries and vigilantes are in a position to organise in recognition of the unmet need of local communities and to take the law into their own hands;</P>
    <P>&ndash;noting also the need for a new system for investigating complaints levelled against the Garda;</P>
    <P>&ndash;bearing in mind the comprehensive package of recommendations proposed by the Patten Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, many of which are of direct relevance and applicability in this jurisdiction;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> condemns the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his inaction in the area of systematic reform of policing, both at legislative and administrative level; calls upon the Minister to introduce a legislative package of reform, including at least the following three elements so as radically to reform policing in Ireland&ndash;</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;a)the establishment of a new Garda Authority, to set the priorities for fighting crime at national level, to make the key decisions relating to policing more open and accountable, to be responsible for senior appointments in the Garda Síochána and to receive and consider reports from the Garda Commissioner on operational decisions,</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;b)the establishment of county policing liaison committees, to agree a county or city policing plan, with regular meetings between the committee and local gardaí to monitor progress and address the concerns of local communities, and</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;c)the abolition of the Garda Complaints Board, the role and functioning of which is widely agreed to be unsatisfactory, and its replacement with a Garda Ombudsman to be responsible for investigating complaints against the Garda, such an officer to be provided with his own staff and to be responsible for a new, independent system for ensuring Garda accountability; and</P>
    <P>calls also for a significant increase in Garda resources and personnel so as adequately to equip the force to meet the challenges which it faces. It goes without saying that confidence in effective, efficient and accountable policing is a critical component of any normal democratic society where the rule of law prevails. The police force in democratic society is a bulwark against crime and disorder and a sustenance for the people. While nobody likes to come to the attention of the police force, we like to know it is there and that we can turn to it with absolute confidence in times of crisis or trouble.</P>
    <P>This country has been exceptionally lucky with its police force. There is a general recognition that the members of the Garda Síochána have served us very well since the foundation of the State and that they have shown particular courage in standing up to paramilitary organisations and organised crime. In doing that they have paid a very high price. We owe a particular debt of gratitude to courageous officers like Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Detective Garda Seamus Quaid of my home town in Wexford, a near neighbour of my own, who paid the ultimate sacrifice in defending our democracy and our laws.</P>
    <P>We were very fortunate that the political figures who presided over the formation of our pol<Col N="584" /> ice force and those who led it in the early days displayed wisdom and judgment. Their decision to have a generally unarmed police force, despite the great disorder in which the State was born, was wise and courageous. The first Commissioner, Michael Staines, set the standard and the force was to consistently meet that standard in subsequent decades when he said: &ldquo;An Garda Síochána will succeed, not by force of arms or numbers, but by the moral authority as servants of the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As with every other organisation or institution, however, and it is coincidental that I am making this contribution directly after a contribution on judicial accountability and the need to have the wind of change blow through the judicial system, the Garda Síochána also has to change and evolve in accordance with the principles of accountability and modernisation.</P>
    <P>The gardaí operate under a body of legislation, some of which goes back as far as 1925, but the nature of society and the demands on policing have changed enormously in that period. It is therefore an appropriate time for a radical overhaul of the structures governing the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Policing in Northern Ireland is currently going through a major and dramatic transformation and while the problems of policing in a politically divided society are somewhat different than those we face in this jurisdiction, there are many lessons we can learn from the Patten report and the process of change now going on there.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Government's response to the Labour Party motion is basically to attack it because it reflects many of the proposals of Patten. I find that disturbing on so many fronts. I say in passing &ndash; and it is an issue I intend to raise at the next meeting of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights &ndash; this is the second occasion on which a Fianna Fáil headed statement has been issued in the name of the chairman of that committee. Chairpersons should not use their office to propose partisan views of a political nature. That is not the way it normally operates. The only meaningful objection to the proposals is that they are reflective of proposals we are advocating take place in Northern Ireland. That is a lame attack on the proposals we are putting forward.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the Patten report that have proved most controversial &ndash; those relating to badges, emblems, oaths and politically contentious matters &ndash; amount to no less than ten out of a total of some 175. Many of the Patten report recommendations set out best practices for policing that would be applicable in any modern society, and I predict that many of them will be reflected in reforms in police forces throughout the western world. We should not be afraid to borrow from the Patten report and I am already on record as saying that in preparing our proposals we want debated in this House, we studied the Patten report very carefully and drew from its conclusions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> There is a desire among members of the public, and among members of the Garda, for radical change. There is some worrying evidence that the confidence the force traditionally enjoyed is not as strong as it once was. People are concerned about what they perceive to be the lower visibility of the Garda on their streets and in their communities, the closure of Garda stations, especially in rural areas, and the continuing problems of crime and vandalism that those of us who are spokespersons now hear about on a daily basis. All of those concerns, as our motion states, demoralise people, terrify the elderly and destroy the lives of so many young people.</P>
    <P>As virtually every Member of this House will be able to attest, there is probably no other issue that so concerns local communities as crime. Despite the claims made by the Minister about the reduction in crime levels, that is not reflected in the experience of life on the ground where people see for themselves the continuing and unacceptable level of murder, gangland shootings and beatings, intimidation, drug dealing, joy-riding and public disorder, which was again discussed on the national airwaves this morning when one taxi driver described the mayhem of the last weekend which apparently is a regular occurrence in this city.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that a considerable amount of crime is going unreported and rather than an overall reduction in crime, that may account for the improved figures. Statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office suggest that crime is considerably higher than the official figures relate. Statistics produced by the CSO in November 1999, based on the findings of the national household survey, show that about 12% of households, one in eight, are affected by crime each year. One household in 30 has been burgled. More than 5% of households with a motor vehicle had either the vehicle stolen or something stolen from the vehicle. Almost 5% of households suffered vandalism in the previous year. Exposure to crime was highest in Dublin where close to one-fifth of all homes surveyed had been victims of crime. The survey found that approximately one in every 100 persons aged 18 or over had been a victim of non-violent theft. Violent thefts and assaults affected about one in every 200 adults. Young adults were found to be most at risk, with more than 3% claiming they had been a victim of assault or theft.</P>
    <P>There is also strong evidence in the survey to support the suggestion that such crime is not reported. While 95% of all car thefts were reported, less than 40% of cases of vandalism were reported to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>This is all a long way from the picture presented by the Minister for zero tolerance who painted a picture of crime levels in the new century returning to the level of the 1950s. When we take into account that much of this crime is concentrated in particular areas, we have to acknowledge that as a society we are failing to provide adequate protection to the majority of law abid<Col N="586" /> ing citizens against the unacceptable activities of a criminal minority.</P>
    <P>Among the reasons for not reporting is a belief, again concentrated in some areas, that it is simply not worthwhile, that it will take the Garda too long to respond and that, when they respond, nothing will be done. That may be entirely unfair to the Garda, who are working under incredible difficulties with limited resources, but it is a real perception that we will ignore at our peril. That perception is being exploited by unscrupulous individuals, many of whom are members of or associated with the republican movement, who offer communities what they claim are simple solutions to the crime problem. These solutions involve violent assaults on people or shooting those alleged to be involved in crime. There is no due process in these kangaroo courts; no right to silence, no right to legal representation and no right of appeal. We have seen the appalling toll these sorts of activities have inflicted in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my constituency within recent weeks, a person of exemplary character was brutally shot in both legs before members of his own family in the kitchen of his home. Apparently, the man was not the intended victim of the assault. Such events came as a shock to the community in Wexford.</P>
    <P>If we do not want to allow the situation to deteriorate even further, we must work to restore full public confidence in the Garda Síochána and provide the resources they need to be effective. The Labour Party believes the only way in which we can defeat crime and vandalism is through a partnership between the community and the Garda Síochána. The community cannot combat crime on its own. Without the support, commitment and confidence of the people, gardaí face an almost impossible task. Labour is determined to forge a new relationship between gardaí and the communities they serve. Communities must be involved in deciding policing priorities and made to feel part of the policing process. We will then have real partnership in terms of fighting crime.</P>
    <P>There are other issues that must be addressed, not least the question of resources and whether existing personnel are being used in the best possible way. Figures are produced from time to time to suggest that Ireland does quite well in regard to the number of gardaí per head of population, but these require close examination. According to the Garda website, there are 11,230 members of the force. However, in the Garda report for 1999, the most recent to be made available, the cumulative figure for each of the six Garda divisions comes to only 9,791. The balance is, presumably, accounted for by those serving at headquarters and in specialist units.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Garda authorities that in effect, 5.1 gardaí are required to maintain each Garda position. This is due to a three shift system, holidays, sick leave, etc. While there may be 11,230 gardaí on paper, the operational level <Col N="587" /> of the force, at any given point, may be as low as 2,500. The huge western region, which stretches from Mayo to Limerick, has, on paper, 1,068 Garda personnel, but when the effective ratio is applied, the level of policing in this region could be as low as 210. A number of colleagues and I spoke to senior Garda officials during the week and discovered that, because of the foot and mouth disease crisis, only a skeleton staff of gardaí is operating in certain towns and rural areas. We accept that this is necessary but there are real consequences for many local areas as a result.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of how existing resources within the Garda are used. From dealings I have had with the Garda, I know that many members of the force are conscious of the limitations of the existing structures. Gardaí have expressed concern at the inadequacies of the training they receive. A survey highlighted at the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors last April found that almost half those questioned said they had experienced bullying in the workplace. At the same conference the acting president of the AGSI, expressed concern that gardaí were in danger of losing the common touch and that this could jeopardise the close relationship between the force and the public. There have been increasing calls among members of the force to allow trade unions to be organised and to grant limited rights to strike. There is a compelling case for allowing the representative bodies to acquire trade union status.</P>
    <P>It is against this background of disquiet within the force and public concerns over crime and policing that we produced our proposals for a package of radical reforms to transform the relationship between the Garda and the community. There is no more urgent issue than this and nothing deserves a more considered debate than the proposals we wish to place before the House.</P>
    <P>There are three key elements in the Labour Party proposals. The first of these involves the establishment of a new Garda authority. The role of the new authority would be to set priorities for fighting crime at national level, to make key decisions relating to making policing more open and accountable, to be responsible for senior appointments in the Garda Síochána and to receive and consider reports from the Garda Commissioner on operational decisions. We envisage that there would be approximately 15 members of the authority who would be appointed by the Government, following consideration by the appropriate Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. These five members would be selected from a range of bodies, including those involved in public administration and business, trade unions, voluntary organisations, community groups, the legal profession and seconded representatives of various ranks from the Garda organisations. While the authority would have overall responsibility <Col N="588" /> for policing strategy, the Commissioner would retain full operational responsibility for the exercise of his or her functions and the activities of Garda officers and civilian staff under his or her direction or control.</P>
    <P>Our second key proposal is the establishment of county policing liaison committees, the function of which would be to agree a county or city policing plan, with regular meetings between these committees and local gardaí to monitor progress and address issues of real concern to people in each community. We envisage that there would be regular meetings between county policing committees and senior Garda officers in each district at which reports could be presented, strategies discussed and answers given. This simply mirrors proposals I put forward, as Minister for the Environment, for strategic policy groups to consider every other area of local administration. Those proposals have been taken up by my successor and the groups have been put in place.</P>
    <P>The county policing committees would reflect community concerns and priorities to the force. They would act purely as liaison bodies and would have no operational function. However, they will give the force new ways of identifying the needs of communities and greatly enforce the community dimension of policing which is currently being eroded.</P>
    <P>The third main pillar of our proposals is the establishment of a Garda ombudsman. It is widely acknowledged that there is a strong case for the abolition of the Garda Complaints Board, the role and functioning of which is unsatisfactory. The members of the Garda Síochána and those who have cause to make complaints find it unsatisfactory and, from comments the Minister has made, it appears he and his Department are at least proposing to put forward radical reforms in this area. It is not good enough to try to tinker with the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act which has been found to be unsatisfactory and virtually unworkable.</P>
    <P>One of the major innovations in policing in Northern Ireland has been the appointment of an independent ombudsman. I have had the opportunity to speak with her and discovered that her office has an effective role in giving a speedy response to local need. This model will be replicated elsewhere. I beg the Minister not to dismiss the concept of an independent ombudsman by stating that just because one has been appointed in Northern Ireland does not mean there is a need for one here. The Northern Ireland model is eminently suitable for implementation in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have only been able to touch on some of the details of the main proposals outlined in the document, Policing Change, which I had the honour to publish on behalf of the Labour Party a few months ago. My party is seeking the broadest possible debate on these issues and I hope the Minister will address our proposals and not merely dismiss them because they emanate from this side of the House. It is not a question of pro<Col N="589" /> posing change simply for the sake of change. The aim of these proposals is to better equip the Garda to combat crime and to renew the relationship between the people and its members.</P>
    <P>The new structures we are proposing will help restore public confidence in the Garda and open the way for improved co-operation between the police and the public, which is the only way to effectively combat crime and vandalism. As already stated, I hope the Government will resist its normal instinct to oppose these proposals, which we offer in good faith, simply because they are being put forward from this side of the House and will consider them on their merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an unspoken assumption that the Garda Síochána is immune from the dramatic changes which have taken place in this society, particularly in recent years. However, it is not. A modern police force must contend with circumstances unimagined in Ireland 20 years ago. The traditional respect and regard in which the members of the Garda were held is under strain, particularly in certain urban communities. In extreme cases, law abiding citizens have become alienated from the gardaí because they cannot access them when they need them, they are not visible and thus they have little relationship with the community and attempts are made to fill the policing lacuna by paramilitary groupings.</P>
      <P>The reality of lawlessness in parts of urban Ireland cannot be denied and threatens the fabric of society. Thousands of people, for example, in parts of my constituency have been deprived on and off since Christmas of public transport as a result of the depredations of marauding youths. The county council in my area retrieved more than 2,000 cars burnt out last year. The chronic misuse of drugs which was allowed to take hold over the years deepened the environment of lawlessness, fuelled the crime statistics and facilitated the growth of paramilitary inspired vigilantes. An occasional Garda car speeding through an estate does not constitute effective policing. In a parliamentary reply to me last week the Minister said that prior to the foot and mouth alarm there were 159 gardaí in Tallaght in a three shift, five day system. That is a completely inadequate policing allocation for a community of 80,000 people. It has a single Garda station which was, until the lifetime of the last Government, a sub-division of Crumlin. Despite its success, where implemented, this is a completely inadequate allocation of resources to community policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were approximately 35 murders on the streets last year. Dublin, Limerick and Dundalk have seen the return of lethal gangland shootings and intimidation. Drug dealing is continuing to tear at the fabric of working class communities. Joyriders regularly take over control of the streets and housing estates. Paramilitary groupings are attempting to take over the policing of certain areas. Contrary to what happened in the last Dáil, the Opposition parties have refused to <Col N="590" /> exploit this situation for short-term political advantage. Instead of whipping up a neurosis under the fatuous zero tolerance mantle, as was recklessly done by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we have prepared policy proposals designed to address the present day realities and the changes which have taken place in Irish society.</P>
    <P>The proposals outlined by Deputy Howlin are good for society and for the gardaí. The Labour Party proposals for a new Garda authority and Garda ombudsman are directly grounded in our recognition of the impact of crime in our community. Crime demoralises people, terrifies our elderly and destroys the lives of many young people. We need an efficient and effective police force to tackle crime. At present, the Garda operates under legislation which dates back to 1925. Society and the demands of policing have changed radically in the past 75 years. It is time the law governing the Garda changed as well.</P>
    <P>An essential part of that change is the forging of a new relationship between the gardaí and the communities they serve. Communities must be involved in deciding policing priorities in consultation with the gardaí. There is no future without a partnership approach to fighting crime. We also want to see a new system for investigating complaints levelled against the gardaí. The current controversies involving the shooting of John Carthy and the unfolding events in the McBrearty case in Donegal demand a response. Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases. The Garda Commissioner has recognised the need for change.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is proposing three new initiatives to radically reform policing in Ireland. We propose the establishment of a new Garda authority. This new authority will set the priorities for fighting crime at national level. The members of the new authority will be proposed by groups, such as trade unions and community and Garda organisations. Nominees will be considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and appointed by the Government. The Garda Commissioner and the authority will work together to draw up an annual policing plan and set national objectives to be achieved over a four year period. The authority will be responsible for senior appointments in the Garda. This power is currently held by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Garda Commissioner will retain operational control of the Garda but will be required to report to the authority on operational decisions. This new authority will make the key decisions relating to policing more open and accountable at national level.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is also committed to seeing these principles brought in at local level. We want to see the establishment of county policing liaison committees. Each county or city council would form such a committee and agree a county or city policing plan. There would be regular meetings between the committee and local gardaí to moni<Col N="591" /> tor progress and address the concerns of local communities. There would also be consultation and direct input into policing plans at local and sub-county level. The danger is that in the absence of such liaison, paramilitaries and vigilantes are in a position to organise in recognition of the unmet need of local communities and to take the law into their own hands. Despite the respect I have for civil servants, I am not sure many of the civil servants in a position to influence policy understand policing and lawlessness in the heart of many urban working class communities today.</P>
    <P>Both these proposals aim to give ownership of our policing strategy back to the community. At present, the relationship between a community and the gardaí, if it exists at all, is developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis through the initiative of local gardaí and community leaders. We need to put this relationship back at the heart of policing in Ireland. We are convinced that policing works best when it is based on partnership between the local people and the local gardaí.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has also proposed the abolition of the Garda Complaints Board and its replacement with a Garda ombudsman. There is now widespread agreement on the unsatisfactory role and functioning of the Garda Complaints Board, most of which is probably due to inadequacies in the law which set it up. Few, including the gardaí, will regret its departure from the scene. The new Garda ombudsman will be responsible for investigating complaints against the gardaí and initiating his own inquiries into Garda policies and practices. The ombudsman will be provided with his own staff and will be responsible for a new independent system for ensuring Garda accountability.</P>
    <P>These three proposals have the capacity to bring policing in Ireland into the 21st century. The Labour Party's plan draws heavily on the Patten proposals, as Deputy Howlin said. We believe our proposals are good for the public and for the gardaí. They will provide the gardaí with a modern and effective legislative base. They will ensure that the interests of the community are at the heart of Garda planning. They will give people an independent avenue to investigate complaints against the gardaí while protecting gardaí against malicious complaints designed to undermine the force.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have served us well since the foundation of the State. Their bravery, particularly in standing up to the threat posed by the IRA and other paramilitaries, is rightly recognised. Like every other organisation, the Garda must change and evolve. Accountability and modernisation are the key principles of the Labour Party's policy. We have Garda legislation based in the 1920s and a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform living in the 1950s. It is time to change both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this motion is to make a positive contribution to a much needed debate on how we can make our police service more responsive and effective in the context of a society which has changed dramatically since the structures of the Garda Síochána were put in place. Both this motion and the proposals in our document are intended to lead that debate. We would like a positive response from the Minister tonight. Deputy Howlin outlined the substance of our proposals and why the reform of policing in Northern Ireland is an added impetus to provide for equally inclusive and transparent operations in the State.</P>
      <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of this issue is the dichotomy between the statistics the Minister likes to repeat at every opportunity which show that crime is decreasing and the experience of people in every corner of the country who are not safe in their homes, streets and communities. It is true that there is a very high level of unreported crime. There are not nearly enough gardaí visible at night to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour. Practically every public representative has the same experience of residents' groups pleading for greater Garda presence especially at night. Community gardaí are doing a fantastic job. They cannot cope with the work they need to do. The Garda generally cannot cope with the level of lawlessness and crime in our communities. Deputy Rabbitte referred to that and it is particularly true in urban areas. People in their own homes and communities are terrified at times. Numbers of people are gathering for various anti-social activities. Drugs are being sold to young people on street corners. Old people are frightened in their homes at night time.</P>
      <P>The experience of people is not of zero tolerance of lawlessness in their communities. Our proposal on county policing liaison committees is particularly worthy of consideration by the Minister and it should be put in place as quickly as possible. That will provide the forum where these issues that are of huge concern would be addressed by the people who know best what is going on in our communities and could be dealt with in a practical way. Much Garda time is spent waiting unnecessarily for court cases to be called and providing county policing liaison committees can help. That is one of the three proposals we are making.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, the lawlessness has meant that even bus services cannot be provided in some communities. I had to arrange a meeting because a postal service could not be provided in a particular community and it was only by gathering together the various groupings that we were able to re-establish that postal service. That is the kind of issue that the county policing liaison committees could address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick we have the worst of both worlds. There is a perception that we have a very high level of violent crime. However, the figures the Minister uses have resulted in us having fewer gardaí than we had when the Government came <Col N="593" /> into office. In the recent allocations we got only two gardaí when other areas got much larger numbers. The reality is greatly different from the picture that is being presented.</P>
    <P>Even the Minister admits there is an increase in acts of violence against women, particularly cases of rape and aggravated sexual assaults. From 1992 to 2000 these numbers have increased by 265% and in the majority of these cases, women were the victims. I urge the Minister to address this issue. It is of very serious concern, particularly to women who feel they cannot walk their streets safely. Quite recently, the gardaí in Limerick issued a warning to women not to walk the streets alone. Surely this is a cause for very serious concern and something that must be addressed immediately. I plead for him to address this problem and ensure that women and all citizens can walk the streets safely.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious problem. We have not had reform of the Garda and the institutions for many years. We are proposing positive measures that will address these concerns and we ask the Minister to take seriously all the aspects of what we are saying and to respond not just in the interest of Members of this House, but in the interest of the general public for whom this is an issue of major importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate. There are serious concerns and worries among communities. I listened with interest to Deputies Rabbitte and O'Sullivan talk of the urban aspect of this problem but it is no different in rural areas. There are 160,000 people in the area presided over by the Carlow-Kildare division of the Garda. There is dismay over what is seen as a drug culture developing in that area. There have been major developments in Kildare and there has been a huge population increase there. However, we only got three additional gardaí in the last allocation, one each in Tullow, Maynooth and Athy.</P>
      <P>Despite such a rise in the population, we cannot guarantee a 24-hour service to the people in the large towns of that area. It is well known to the criminals in Dublin that many of the towns in rural Kildare do not have such a service and they feel free to come on rampages at night. Many small shops and garages have practically been put out of business because of the robberies and intimidation of workers. However, this is not being reflected in the numbers of gardaí appointed to Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent parliamentary question I asked the Minister about the escalation of the drug culture. Based on the Minister's figures, it is clear that I am right and that a drug culture has been allowed to develop in the country. In Kildare and Carlow the number of convictions were as follows: in 1995 there were 59; in 1996 there were 90; in 1997 there were 113; in 1998 there were 158 and in 1999 there were 319. This is a dramatic increase. In 1995 when there were only 59 convictions, we felt that the problem was limited to the higher <Col N="594" /> populated areas of County Kildare. Alas that is no longer the case and the whole of Kildare and Carlow are now affected.</P>
    <P>My greatest concern is over the number of seminars that the gardaí are carrying out. These are going in the opposite direction. In 1995 there were 143 seminars; in 1996 there were 125; in 1997 there were 123; in 1998 there were 69 and last year just 20. If this is what we are doing to protect youngsters going to school, then there is a grave need to change the methodology we are adopting on law and order. If we do not teach these children that taking drugs is wrong, then we are saying that a drug culture is acceptable to us and that would be a catastrophe. I seriously doubt if any Member of this House would want such a thing to be their legacy of what they did in Dáil Éireann. I want to see an effort made by the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children to protect the children through providing seminars. They need to go to the schools and involve the parents and community leaders to ensure that the next generation will be a healthy generation and not dependent on drugs and the drug barons who are destroying our society.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Minister to reverse the figures and to protect the children so that people can go on to rear their families in the way we want them to be reared, free from a drug culture.</P>

      <P>It is this Government which has demonstrated its commitment and willingness to back-up the efforts of the Garda in the fight against crime. Prior to entering Government, we said we would adopt a zero tolerance of crime. To assist us in the task on entering Government we said we would increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000, an all-time historic high and we are almost there; provide the resources to enable the force to do its job effec<Col N="597" /> tively, we are doing so; increase the capacity of the prison system by 2,000 &ndash; 1,207 have been provided and 700 more are on the way, an increase of almost 100%; introduce tough legislation to provide for severe penalties including mandatory penalties for drug trafficking offences and asset audits on those convicted of serious offences &ndash; we did so; reform the courts system by establishing a Courts Service Board &ndash; that has been done; reform the prison system &ndash; we have a new Prison Authority; establish a witness protection programme &ndash; we succeeded in doing so; establish a Garda aerial wing &ndash; we did so; establish a mounted police unit &ndash; we did so; fund an unprecedented information technology programme for all areas of the criminal justice system and in particular for the Garda, the prisons and the courts &ndash; that has been done.</P>
      <P>My task, on becoming Minister, was to translate those promises into reality. I am confident I can let the record speak for itself. The Government does not deal in airy statements of intent but in practical realities. Under this Government recorded crime in this State has fallen at an unprecedented rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been achieved through the Government's three-pronged commitment to ensuring that there is a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in crime, ensuring there is a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and through a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the cause of crime. As a Government, we are unyielding in this approach and we make no apologies for that. The results we have achieved, I remind the House, are no accident.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion speaks of this House being: &ldquo;Conscious of the danger that, in the absence of such close liaison, paramilitaries and vigilantes are in a position to organise in recognition of the unmet need of local communities and to take the law into their own hands.&rdquo;  I presume the Deputy has in mind recent reports about the activities of some members of Sinn Féin in North Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, Deputy Howlin should have thought long and hard before coming into this House with a motion which contains a form of pseudo-justification of activities of the kind in question. Is anyone seriously suggesting that the so-called anti-crime activities of Sinn Féin in North Kerry arise because the local gardaí are not in touch with the community? The reality is that what we are faced with are people who <Col N="598" /> seek to go behind the rule of law apparently expecting to gain at the ballot box for behaving in what is a profoundly undemocratic way. The Deputy's motion may be equivocal about this but let me state the Government's position plainly.</P>

      <P>Recorded crime levels have fallen for each year in which this Government has held office. Last year's provisional figures show that levels of recorded crime fell by almost 5% on the 1999 figure, representing a cumulative fall on the all-time high in 1995 levels of 25%. People in this House have stated that crimes go unreported. Yes, they do but the criteria employed today for the collection, collation and recording of crime are precisely the same as those utilised during the period of the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The reports of the Garda Commissioner which set out the levels of crime during the period of this Government were compiled utilising precisely the same criteria used during the rainbow coalition Government. Compare and contrast an unprecedented increase in indictable crime during the period of the rainbow coalition Government, particularly in 1995 when there was an unprecedented drop of almost 25% during the period of this Government. Facts speak for themselves when one is comparing like with like.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, it is very important to note that the detection rate for <Col N="599" /> recorded crime has increased significantly in recent years. Ireland now has a detection rate of 44% compared to 21% in the United States of America and 26% in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Any long-term anti-crime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, and this is why a National Crime Forum was established in 1998. Furthermore, recognising the importance of an informed public debate on crime as an aid to policy making and as a means of dispelling the real but disproportionate fear of crime in some communities, I have established a National Crime Council, the first in the history of the State, to examine public awareness of the issues surrounding crime and public perceptions of crime. The council will also advise me on additional crime prevention measures.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 1999, the last year for which published statistics are available, the number of recorded murders has remained annually constant at 38. This compares with murder levels of 43 and 42 for the years 1995 and 1996, respectively. Moreover, there has been a steady decrease in the number of cases of manslaughter since the Government took office, from 15 in 1997 to 13 in 1998 and nine in 1999.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that prevailing trends indicate that there is no appreciable increase in public order offences. In fact, a downward trend has been recorded in some of the flash points in our major cities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Nevertheless, in response to public concerns on the matter, the Garda Commissioner has launched a national public order initiative known as Operation Oíche to tackle street violence and public disorder on the main thoroughfares of the larger towns and cities. The operation is focused on public disorder, public intoxication, under-age drinking, illicit drug use and under-age alcohol sales. Within Operation Oíche, locations of recurring incidents are receiving particular Garda attention, with an emphasis on high visibility policing. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are being utilised and selected locations are receiving intensive patrolling involving the Garda mounted unit, Garda dog unit and Garda air support unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has overseen the establishment of county and city development boards, or CDBs, as a co-ordinating structure at local level to develop and implement agreed strategies for the economic, social and cultural development of the county or city. The boards comprise representatives of local government, the social partners <Col N="600" /> and relevant State agencies, including the Garda Síochána and the probation and welfare service. Their purpose is to bring together the plans of all CDB member groups and agencies to arrive at a shared vision of county or city development. In so doing, they will address the specific difficulties experienced by local communities which contribute to high crime victimisation rates.</P>
    <P>Last February, the Government launched RAPID, that is revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, which is a focused initiative targeting the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The areas will be targeted for investment in relation to policing as well as health, housing, education, child care and community facilities. This will mean that, at the local level, any individual household identified as in need of support will be able to avail of the services of a number of agencies at once rather than the independent system of provision as before.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to see that the Labour Party motion raises the question of resources for the Garda Síochána. The Garda has never been as well resourced and financed as under this Government. Since taking office I have increased the strength of the Garda Síochána from a base line of 10,800 and I am on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by the year 2002. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength to 11,800 by the end of 2001 and a new competition will bring Garda numbers up to 12,000 next year. This means that, during my term of office, the Government has already achieved the highest strength levels ever, and that process is being reinforced further.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Estimates for the Garda Vote have increased from £472 million in 1997 to £698 million for 2001, an increase of 48%. The overall Department budget has also increased very substantially since the last Administration. I am determined that the Garda should have the best, the most modern and the most effective equipment possible to carry out its tasks. For instance, a contract has been entered into for the supply of a new EC 135 helicopter for the Garda air support unit. The helicopter is currently being fitted out with police mission equipment and it is expected that this work will be completed shortly. Pilot and observers training will be completed before the EC 135 commences active Garda operations later this year.</P>
    <P>CCTV has shown that it can play a vital and important role in the fight against crime and disorder. As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, last November I announced the allocation of a total of £12 million towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas &ndash; Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due <Col N="601" /> course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001 to 2002.</P>
    <P>I understand that tenders will soon issue for the provision of town centre CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The planning, including the consultation process, for the location and operation of Garda CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford will commence later this year with the objective of having the systems installed and operational in 2002. While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature of them and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences. I am, however, also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme this year to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>
    <P>A key priority for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be criminal law reform. Naturally when I became Minister I was determined to lose no time in undertaking a major programme of criminal law reform and the results of my determination in that respect are there for all to see. Our law reform programme must be able to respond to the challenges which society faces from the modern realities of crime &ndash; in particular, organised crime and drug related crime. I have met, and will continue to meet, these challenges with measures which are as strong as they need to be so that society can protect itself.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the range of criminal law that I have introduced from the debates in this House over the past four years. Its purpose is to ensure that the criminal justice system is equipped to respond effectively to the investigation and prosecution of modern day manifestations of crime. There is one proposal which I should mention. In February last year I announced that I had secured Government <Col N="602" /> approval for the drafting of a criminal justice Bill based on the report of the expert group, established under the chairmanship of senior counsel, Mr. Eamon Leahy, to consider changes to criminal law recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, that is, the Garda SMI Report. This development is further evidence of my commitment to ensuring that our gardaí, who are on the frontline in the battle to prevent and investigate crime, have at their disposal full legislative support to do their job fully and effectively on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Labour Party motion seeks to imply, I have been extremely active in promoting and developing change within the Garda Síochána to enable it to meet the demands of our modern society and to carry out its tasks as efficiently and effectively as possible. This is an operation that has been undertaken, to a large extent, under the Garda SMI process. The Garda SMI programme commenced in 1998 and significant progress has been made since then in developing and implementing the wide ranging recommendations contained in the Garda SMI report. The aim is to bring about administrative reform which will position the Garda organisation to respond to the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>One major development to date under the SMI process is a report on the potential for further civilianisation in the Garda Síochána and it recommends the civilianisation of posts in administrative and technical areas currently held by gardaí.</P>
    <P>This report was recently endorsed by the Garda SMI steering group which includes representation from Garda management, my Department and the staff representative associations.</P>
    <P>The report envisages the release of 556 members to operational policing. This will permit a substantial body of Garda personnel to be made available, in particular to tackle and prevent crime. The release of these members will not affect the Government policy of increasing the strength of the force to 12,000. I look forward to the impact of the report which will undoubtedly result in enhanced public safety and reduce public fear of crime and street violence. Releasing members to operational duties will also put their expensive training and experience to the best use.</P>
    <P>The report on civilianisation represents a true partnership approach to the future of the Garda Síochána as an organisation and I commend Garda management and the representative associations for their professional approach in engaging so constructively in its development. I will bring the civilianisation report to Government shortly and am convinced of the merits of proceeding with its early implementation.</P>
    <P>Another major project under Garda SMI is the review of all aspects of the organisational structure and operating systems within An Garda <Col N="603" /> Síochána. In December 2000, the Garda SMI steering group recruited consultants to commence this comprehensive review. Under the terms of reference, the consultants are required to develop the &ldquo;HQ specific&rdquo; and core role functions, to review the roles of ranks and to develop criteria in relation to stations. In completing the work programme, the consultants must evaluate a range of options identified under the SMI programme, make clear recommendations and develop a clear implementation plan. In assessing criteria in relation to stations, for example, the consultants will focus on the best use of Garda resources to deliver a policing service to the community. Contrary to recent media reports, the consultants will not recommend the closure of any Garda stations but will highlight criteria which could be taken into account in any future assessment of how the function or location of Garda stations best serves the community. This review should be completed by August or September this year. The recommendations brought forward in the consultants' report will then be considered by the Garda SMI steering group and, ultimately, by Government.</P>
    <P>Through the Garda SMI process, a more strategic approach to developing Garda and civilian personnel is also well advanced. Reviews recommending more modern and appropriate human resource management, promotion and training frameworks have been completed. A skilled civilian human resource manager and a training and education specialist are currently being recruited to manage the introduction of the new structures. The Garda Commissioner has commenced discussions with staff associations on a performance management system and this is being progressed. New approaches to the organisation and deployment of personnel have been developed through a new rostering framework, the civilianisation study and the Garda establishment redistribution model project which will address the allocation of personnel. The continuing involvement of gardaí and civilian staff and their associations and unions has been central to these changed management initiatives.</P>
    <P>A more strategic approach to management of the Garda Síochána's financial resources has been developed. A director of finance and two support accountants have been appointed. Their function is to oversee the implementation of appropriate accounting and financial information systems as recommended in the financial management report. This will lead to the provision of more detailed and accurate management information to inform management decisions and accountability.</P>
    <P>A Garda National Quality Service Bureau, headed by a director of quality service, has been established to drive the implementation of the Garda quality service action plan. In addition, regional and divisional quality service managers have been appointed. A national customer panel with representation from the community, busi<Col N="604" /> ness and other interests has also been set up. A draft customer charter is being developed in consultation with the national customer panel.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, in accordance with the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, accountability for policing rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Oireachtas. The implementation by the Garda Síochána of Government policing priorities has been achieved over the years through regular contacts between me, my Department and the Garda Síochána. During my time as Minister, I have overseen a progression towards a more structured and transparent framework for Garda planning and accountability.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána corporate strategy, 2000-2004, outlines the Garda mission objectives, states its strategic goals and outlines enabling strategy to achieve those goals. The Garda Síochána annual policing plan for 2001 builds on the corporate strategy, identifies specific targets for the year and sets out a range of performance indicators through which Garda performance can be assessed. There is an undertaking to report on the results in future Garda annual reports.</P>
    <P>I welcome these developments which will improve Garda strategic planning and Garda accountability. I have appointed senior officials in my Department to work with senior Garda representatives to further review the overall performance and accountability framework for the Garda Síochána. This review will address the process of developing police policy and Garda resource management in addition to the issues of planning and accountability. I am confident this group will build on the type of developments outlined and will bring forward a framework whereby Government objectives will be translated into policing priorities. In addition, Garda performance in achieving objectives will be reported on regularly.</P>
    <P>The legislation which provides for the Garda Síochána has existed since the foundation of the State and has served the country well. However, I am conscious that we have moved into a new millennium, that society has become ever more complex and that the challenges facing the Garda have changed substantially.</P>
    <P>The extensive programme of change arising from the Garda strategic management initiative, in itself, will require legislative change, whether to deal with resource management issues or to provide for direct recruitment of civilians. I will monitor developments over the coming months and will continue to review the need for legislative change. Deputies can be assured that whatever legislation is required will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness requires the public service to implement improved strategic planning, to develop modern human resource management systems, including performance management and training development, and to enhance customer service. Many of these issues are being progressed under the <Col N="605" /> Garda SMI process. However, the PPF requires independent validation of satisfactory progress in these key areas of administrative reform. A quality assurance group to assess progress in advancing reform in the Garda Síochána is currently being established with representation from Garda management, representative associations, my Department, business expertise and Garda customers. I wish this group well in its activities from now to late 2002.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a case has been made for the establishment of a police authority in the circumstances which obtain in this jurisdiction. The best approach for the present is to continue to advance the major programme of change under the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>One of the issues addressed in the Labour Party motion is the question of complaints against the Garda Síochána. A number of investigations into actions involving members of the Garda are pending. In that context, there is clearly an onus on us to be careful about what we say in regard to individual cases. Members will be aware, from recent contributions I have made in the House, that I accept that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána are not fully satisfactory and need to be reformed. In that regard, I have also made it clear that I intend to bring forward appropriate proposals to the Government to amend the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the 1986 Act is complex legislation and that its revision raises important matters that must be fully considered. With that in mind, I have undertaken a detailed review of the relevant issues. The review, which is very close to finality, focuses not only on complaints against individual members but covers wider policing concerns. Arising from the review I have decided to bring forward proposals on the establishment of an independent inspectorate for the Garda Síochána. This body could deal with complaints, for example, that specific Garda systems or operations have not measured up to the appropriate standard. Members will appreciate the advantages of the inspectorate which will be well placed to conduct investigations and to provide early reports on its findings.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in some detail what is being done to ensure that the Garda Síochána has appropriate structures in place to respond effectively and accountably to the challenges which it faces. In a changing environment, changes are necessary. Let us not dress up proposals for change with ill-disguised attacks on An Garda Síochána. The Government has the highest regard for the contribution made by the Garda &ndash; sometimes at great cost &ndash; since the foundation of the State. Recent Garda successes, some of which of their nature cannot be brought into the public domain, are testament to a dedicated and efficient police force. That is not to suggest that changes cannot continue to be made to better equip the force. However, anyone aware of the <Col N="606" /> speed, efficiency and thoroughness with which the Garda responded to the foot and mouth disease crisis could not but be impressed by the competence of the force in responding effectively, on behalf of the community, to very difficult and demanding situations.</P>
    <P>To be candid, the motion before the House this evening is political posturing masquerading as policy making.</P>

He apparently criticises the Labour Party for trying to adapt to this State some of the worthwhile recommendations in the Patten report and is critical of the idea that anything contained in that report should be implemented in the context of reforming our police services while, as a member of Government, playing a leading role in convincing the British Government that the Patten report, unamended and unadulterated, should be implemented on the northern part of this island. The contempt the Minister has shown for the recommendations in the Patten report is extremely ill-judged. It may be designed for domestic political purposes but I have little doubt the type of comment he makes about the report will be picked up and relied upon by those in Northern Ireland who are obstructing its implementation. The Minister would be better advised to reconsider the type of <Col N="607" /> presentation he has made in this House and not repeat it.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána was founded under the Garda Síochána Act, 1925, by a Fine Gael Government. Since its foundation, Fine Gael has supported and valued the work of the Garda Síochána at every opportunity. The gardaí are in the frontline in the fight against crime and over the years have displayed extraordinary courage and bravery in confronting subversion and terrorism and prosecuting members of subversive and terrorist organisations. The Garda Síochána has over the past 32 years played a vital role in protecting democracy and our democratic institutions against paramilitary organisations committed to their destruction. In doing so, members of the Garda have lost their lives and many have suffered serious injury. All too often, public focus is on misbehaviour by a small number of members of the Garda force and, unfortunately, the Garda Síochána rarely receives the praise it deserves for the extraordinary work done by members of the force.</P>
      <P>The contribution of the Minister is not only disingenuous but patently dishonest. A pretence has been made by him that the previous Government did nothing in the area of criminal law reform with regard to modernising the Garda force. The contribution made by him is even more extraordinary because, in so far as any reforms have been introduced in relation to the Garda Síochána, they derive from work done by the previous Government. It is unfortunate the Minister does not have the honesty to acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>The steering group on the review of the Garda Síochána was established by the rainbow coalition on 2 July 1996. It produced its recommendations for reform in July 1997, a short couple of weeks after the current Minister took office. In so far as reforms have been introduced by this Minister or Government, they derive from the recommendations made by the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. There still remains recommendations in that report initiated by the previous Government and unimplemented by the current Government. Again, the Minister should moderate his approach and not make a pretence that all wisdom vests in him and any action taken in these areas derives from the lucky coincidence to this State of his being appointed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The reality and irony is that the Minister is implementing recommendations made by a body established by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 75 years, there have been a total of 15 Acts of the Oireachtas amending or supplementing the Garda Síochána Act, 1925. It is time, therefore, to implement a comprehensive review of the body of Garda Síochána legislation. The time has come to replace existing legislation with a single comprehensive reforming and consolidated Act which meets the 21st century needs of the force, ensures the resources required by <Col N="608" /> the Garda Síochána are provided annually and that there is a full role in the workings of the Garda Síochána and interaction between the gardaí and local communities. The time has also come for a comprehensive examination of the role of the Garda Síochána in 21st century Ireland. To date, in so far as that role has been examined, we have had a series of initiatives of a piecemeal nature which have examined aspects of the role played by the Garda Síochána and of Garda structures. The time has now come for a far more comprehensive approach. Fine Gael proposes that a commission on the Garda Síochána be established to examine the workings and efficiency of the force, to report and make recommendations on the resources of the force, the mechanisms required to enable gardaí to operate in constructive and inclusive partnership with the community at all levels and to examine the obligations and rights of members of the force and the rights of the general public <i>vis-à-vis</i> the force.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement made provision for the establishment of an independent commission to make recommendations for future policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. This resulted in the Patten report. While the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the general community in this State is different from the historical relationship between the RUC and the different communities served by it, the question must be asked why there is now in place a comprehensive framework of recommendations for the modernisation of the RUC in Northern Ireland and why no similar comprehensive examination of the workings of the Garda Síochána, together with a framework of proposals for reform, is in place in this State.</P>
    <P>Under the strategic management initiative, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has arranged for a review of aspects of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda. In December 2000, Deloitte and Touche, consultants, were appointed by the Minister to carry out this review. Under the terms of reference, the consultants are limited to considering the following matters &ndash; the development of the HQ and regional organisation structures, the review of the HQ specific and core role functions, the review of the roles of the ranks and the development of criteria in relation to Garda stations. This review is far too narrow and limited and is a waste of public funds. Why should the gardaí be treated differently, for example, from the nursing profession? If there is a commission on nursing and a proposal for a commission on teaching, why should there not be a commission on the Garda Síochána? All interested parties would be entitled to express their views to the commission and have them taken into account. Proposals for reform which would emanate from such commission would greatly strengthen the force and the confidence of the general public in it. The commission on the Garda, which should report simultaneously to the Minister and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and <Col N="609" /> Women's Rights within a specific and limited timeframe, should include in its findings recommendations relating to a number of areas of substantial importance and public interest, some of which I will now refer to.</P>
    <P>This State has committed itself under the Good Friday Agreement to &ldquo;take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction&rdquo;. Although the European Convention on Human Rights has been part of the law in Northern Ireland for some time, the Government has still not enacted the necessary legislation applicable to this State. In a particular way, the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and of other international legal instruments in the field of human rights should be written into the functions of the Garda Síochána, and a mechanism should be put in place to ensure compliance by the Garda with these principles.</P>
    <P>The democratic accountability of the Garda Síochána should be improved. In tonight's motion, the Labour Party is proposing the establishment of a new Garda authority, a proposal which has substantial merit. However, we should not create a new quango which diminishes the accountability of the Garda force, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to this House and which acts as a barrier to information being furnished on issues of public importance and controversy. Provision should be made for the Garda Commissioner to make a formal report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights every six months on issues relating to the workings of the gardaí nationally and to make himself available to the committee to answer questions raised by its members. Government proposals to appoint individuals as assistant commissioners or as commissioner of the Garda should also come before the Joint Committee for its approval before any such appointments are made.</P>
    <P>At present, while the gardaí are part of every local community, in reality, the force operates apart from the communities it serves. There are currently in place no formal consultative statutory structures providing for dialogue between local gardaí and the local communities they serve.</P>
    <P>Within each local authority area at corporation and county council level Fine Gael favours putting in place local police committees, membership of which should include the local Garda superintendent; a representative from the juvenile liaison officers; elected representatives from the local authorities; representatives from local neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes and representatives from other community organisations such as community councils and residents' associations. Statutory provision should require quarterly meetings of such committees to discuss policing issues of local concern.</P>
    <P>Questions relating to the size and deployment of the force must be addressed. It is unacceptable that certain localities have become no-go areas <Col N="610" /> for bus services and for the Garda Síochána. As our cities have changed, the Garda force has, on occasion, been too slow to adapt to that change. For example, it is unacceptable that an area such as Tallaght has fewer gardaí than the city of Limerick, although Tallaght has a greater population. It is unacceptable that law and order broke down to such a degree in parts of Tallaght in recent weeks that bus drivers found themselves nightly under siege and their lives placed at risk and as a consequence the majority of law abiding residents of Tallaght were deprived of an essential bus service. There is something seriously wrong with the organisation of a police force that cannot for a number of weeks adequately address such a problem. There is something seriously derelict in the manner in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has exercised his duties that for weeks he ignored the reality of the extent of the problem confronting Dublin Bus and local residents in Tallaght as a consequence of action taken by a small group of young hoodlums.</P>
    <P>It is a major concern that the 1999 report of the strategic management initiative states that &ldquo;members, especially at Garda and Sergeant level, perceive that organisational and management commitment to staff training and development is generally poor&rdquo;. The SMI also expressed surprise that no fitness training is provided to members of the Garda. This would come as a considerable surprise to the public. The SMI recommends that the current target of in-service training of only three to four days a year should be extended. Fine Gael believes it should be substantially extended. The Government has to date utterly failed to address this extremely important issue.</P>
    <P>The Patten report referred considerable to the need for additional co-operation between the Northern Ireland police service and the Garda Síochána. It is worrying that the report had to recommend, at recommendation 165, that joint database development should be pursued as a matter of priority in all the main areas of cross- Border criminality, such as drugs, smuggling, vehicle theft and terrorism. It should not have required a recommendation by Patten for the establishment of such a database. The Minister should clarify what progress has been made in this area to date.</P>
    <P>New structures must include an independent and effective complaints service both in relation to complaints from members of the public and to address complaints by members of the Garda force made against their colleagues or superiors. There is a need to provide a structure to protect individual officers who, for example, have suffered from bullying, or unfair disciplinary procedures, or who may wish to blow the whistle on colleagues who are not carrying out their duties correctly, who are known to be behaving in a dis<Col N="611" /> honest manner or who have misconducted themselves. There is also a need to examine the issue of Garda compensation. It should not be necessary for members of the force who have suffered personal injury, or the relatives of members who have suffered death in the course of duty to first of all seek the approval of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and then apply to the High Court for the appropriate compensation to which they are rightly entitled. There is a need for a new structure to be put in place to permit members of the Garda, as a right, to apply to a Compensation Board with the minimum of formality, and the maximum of speed for the payment of compensation where an entitlement to compensation arises under existing law.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Complaints Board in December 1998 submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a report outlining changes required to the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986, to facilitate complaints made against gardaí being efficiently processed, investigated and determined. The Minister has ignored the concerns expressed by the complaints board to date and, as a consequence of his doing so, the annual number of outstanding complaints awaiting decision has escalated. Complaints not dealt with undermine public confidence in the Garda Síochána where the allegations made against a member are false and affect the capacity of that member to undertake his or her work and detrimentally impacts on morale. There is a need for a new approach to be taken in dealing with complaints against gardaí made by members of the general public.</P>
    <P>In November last, the Garda Commissioner acknowledged there is a need for a new structure providing for an independent investigation of such complaints. The Minister has talked of a new independent inspectorate but has done nothing to put one in place. There is also a need to either radically reform the workings of the current complaints board or to replace it with a Garda Ombudsman whose functions would be similar to the Police Ombudsman established in Northern Ireland as recommended by Patten.</P>
    <P>In dealing with matters relating to the Garda Síochána, the Minister and the Government resemble a rabbit caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck. The Government and the Minister have essentially been paralysed by inaction.</P>
    <P>It is more than four years since allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area were first made. In the McBrearty affair, more than 150 criminal charges brought against members of one family have been struck out. In relation to the Shortt prosecutions, the State offered no case on appeal following convictions being obtained in the original criminal prosecution and, as a consequence, convictions were set aside. Last summer, the Garda Commissioner publicly <Col N="612" /> announced that members of the force were being moved out of Donegal in the interests of the force and in the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>To date, a public inquiry has not been conducted into allegations of Garda corruption in the Donegal area and detailed information of relevance to clarify what has occurred has not been given to this House by the Minister. As a consequence, public confidence in the Garda has been undermined and members of the force, particularly those stationed in Donegal, who at all times have acted properly, operate under a cloud of public suspicion. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is accountable to this House for the Garda force and it is not acceptable that this issue has been allowed to continue to fester.</P>
    <P>It is on the watch of this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there has been substantial escalation in street violence. Too many young people have lost their lives on the streets of our cities and too few members of the Garda are currently deployed in community policing and are visibly seen to be on the beat preventing crime. Serious questions which arise about Garda deployment must be answered. There is little confidence, however, in this House that the Minister is competent to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have seen him abdicate his responsibility for law and order in the Kerry area to a former IRA gunrunner and current Sinn Féin general election candidate. It is unacceptable that Sinn Féin attempts in this State to run its own private police force and by so doing undermine the role of the Garda and the courts. It is extraordinary that a Minister who represents the County of Kerry in this House should be so blissfully unaware of the activities of Sinn Féin in his own constituency that he has still not reported to the House on what is going on in his own political backyard. Action must be taken to prevent subversive and paramilitary organisations pretending to local communities that they have the capacity to act as a local police force in order to seek electoral support. Following a crime being committed, if a member of Sinn Féin is rapidly able to detect the alleged perpetrator and to recover stolen goods, a serious question should be asked about the relationship between the alleged perpetrator and the so-called Sinn Féin or IRA investigator. Questions should be asked about what discussions took place between them prior to any alleged crime first being committed. Could it be that in Kerry, Sinn Féin is setting up burglaries and thefts to facilitate its successfully investigating such incidents and returning property to those from whom it was originally stolen? </P>
    <P>In Opposition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform constantly beat the drum of zero tolerance. In Government, he has totally failed to initiate the essential reforms <Col N="613" /> required to modernise our police force and to bring our policing structures into the 21st century. He has allowed public confidence in the Garda to be undermined by a failure to tackle and publicly address allegations of Garda misconduct and has failed to take the initiatives necessary to ensure a visible presence of gardaí on our streets to provide the general public with the protection to which it is entitled. In essence, under the watch of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, zero tolerance has been replaced by and has evolved into zero competence.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for sharing his time. I echo the point made by him in regard to the Patten report. I hope the Government will seek to clarify the point the Minister is trying to make. It would be regrettable if he brought this report into disrepute in his efforts to score a political point against the motion.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Labour Party motion which is very timely and which we will support. Reading through the motion, one can see a long list of areas in which this Minister has failed.

      <P>I raise this issue at the request of the Labour Party councillors on Tullamore UDC and John Dwyer, the Labour Party candidate in Laoighis-Offaly in the forthcoming general election. Tullamore, in the middle of Offaly and part of the Laoighis-Offaly constituency, is being neglected by the Government. It is surrounded by the Celtic tiger. Many commuters who have moved to live in Tullamore and elsewhere may travel to work in the Celtic tiger economy but Tullamore is still waiting for part of the wealth being generated in the economy to arrive on its doorsteps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government clearly does not care. The following jobs have been lost in Tullamore and adjoining areas in recent times: Lowe Alpine, 220 jobs; Snickers, 20 jobs and Daliber, 20 jobs in Tullamore; 60 jobs at Dawn Dairies in Moate and 90 jobs at Leonishe in Birr. Something has to be done quickly. A task force was established by Tullamore UDC at the instigation of the <Col N="614" /> Labour Party and many others to address this issue and it has requested a meeting with the Tánaiste on a number of occasions without success. I received a mealy mouthed reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled on behalf of my colleagues in Tullamore and the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly from the Tánaiste and sadly, with due respect to the Minister of State who is present, her lack of presence in the House is yet another indication of the contempt she has for this particular problem.</P>
    <P>The members of the task force are Mr. Sweeney, county manager and chairperson, Mr. Keyes, director of community and enterprise, Councillor J. Feely, chairman, Tullamore UDC, Councillor Flanagan, Tullamore UDC, Councillor Starling, Tullamore UDC, Mr. S. Ryan, chief executive, county enterprise board, Mr. S. Buggle, branch secretary, SIPTU, Mr. P. Conway, regional director, FÁS, Mr. Hyland, regional manager, IDA Ireland, Ms Geaney, regional manager, IDA Ireland, Mr. Mernagh, regional director, Enterprise Ireland and Mr. Naughton, president, Tullamore Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>This is a broadly representative group and it is issuing a cry for help to the Government and a demand that action be taken at a time of plenty. It is appropriate that a Fianna Fáil Minister of State is present to reply on this matter. Fianna Fáil does not care. The party has three seats in the constituency, which it takes for granted. Fianna Fáil also takes the people of Laoighis-Offaly for granted, which it has done for many years. The party can continue to ignore this constituency and concentrate its energy and largesse, as we saw earlier, on other projects elsewhere where it hopes to win additional votes because it takes its votes in Laoighis-Offaly for granted.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure the task force meets the Tánaiste as a matter of urgency and I want the Minister of State to give that commitment unequivocally in the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leader of the Labour Party for affording me an opportunity to support his call and to acknowledge the initiative and work undertaken by the Labour Party councillors, Mr. John Dwyer, the Labour Party candidate, and the Fine Gael councillors on Tullamore UDC, who have been very much crying in the wilderness where this issue is concerned. I welcome the raising of the issue by the leader of the Labour Party in the House. Tullamore has become a jobs black spot and has been totally ignored by the Tánaiste, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and, unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil led Government to the extent that there has been a catalogue of job losses in Tullamore particularly, and throughout the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monthly jobless figures were published last Friday and were lauded by the Minister of State <Col N="615" /> and his colleagues as a reflection of the success of the Celtic tiger in terms of job creation and maintenance. However, there was a gaping hole in the figures which relates to the midlands where there has been little job creation and even less jobs maintenance. Jobs, particularly in the traditional employment sectors, have been lost. In addition to the job losses outlined by Deputy Quinn, thousands of jobs have been lost over the past ten years at Bord na Móna and the ESB.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue, ignored by Fianna Fáil, as my colleague said, because of the comfortable three seat mentality whereby the party thinks that by ignoring the people it can still retain top dog status with a Minister in the constituency. It is time to redress that imbalance and deal with this serious situation.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has received a request to meet the Tullamore task force but has been, unfortunately, unable to accede to it due to a heavy schedule of commitments. She and I are aware of recent job losses in Tullamore, in particular, the decision of Lowe Alpine to cease manufacturing in Tullamore, and the reduction of employment at Snickers. With regard to complacency on the part of Fianna Fáil in that area, I assure both Deputies that the local Minister, Deputy Cowen, and myself were closely involved in the issues that arose following the closure of Lowe Alpine. There were problems regarding severance payments for workers and both myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were involved in trying to assist&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept we must move on and deal with the issue. I assure both Deputies enterprise support agencies operating under the aegis of our Department are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in Tullamore and in County Offaly in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS met and briefed the management and unions regarding the supports it could put in place in the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the closure at Lowe Alpine. <Col N="616" /> FÁS then conducted briefing sessions with all staff in Lowe Alpine, in conjunction with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. FÁS also organised one-to-one guidance interviews with the workers and, as a result, set up a training course for <i>curriculum vitae</i> preparation and interview skills for staff who wished to avail of this. FÁS reports that a significant number of employers have contacted it and Lowe Alpine with vacancies they wish to fill, which would be suitable for staff who have been made redundant.</P>
    <P>The Border, midlands and west region, of which County Offaly is part, is a priority location for job promotion by the industrial development agencies. While job losses at Daliber, Lowe Alpine and Snickers have been a considerable setback for Tullamore, significant developments have also been made with IDA Ireland assistance over the past 18 months. Since September 1998, three significant projects were approved for Tullamore. These are Continental AG, Flextronics and Grafica Zannini. Current employment in these projects is approximately 480.</P>
    <P>In 2000, there were 18 site visits by IDA Ireland clients to Tullamore and there have been 11 such visits thus far in 2001. Considerable interest has been expressed in the 22,000 sq. ft. advance factory at Srah Business Park and IDA Ireland is hopeful of securing a client for the facility. IDA Ireland briefed the inter-agency group, of which it is itself a member, on the position at its last meeting on 23 March. IDA Ireland has secured agreement with the owners of the Lowe Alpine facility in Tullamore to market it for an inward investment project.</P>
    <P>With the announcement of the down sizing of the Snickers operation and its relocation to a smaller building, IDA Ireland is also in the process of producing a marketing brochure to promote the facility for inward investment. Enterprise Ireland will also continue to actively promote the Tullamore area as a location for new projects.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland's midlands regional office is also represented on the inter-agency task force to optimise the response to the job losses in Tullamore. The county manager acts as chairman and three meetings have been held to date. The next meeting of the task force is scheduled for Thursday, 26 April 2001. Enterprise Ireland inquired as to the availability of small, well serviced office space in Tullamore at the second meeting on 22 February 2001. A number of premises have since been identified which may be suitable for small traded service type projects. In addition, Enterprise Ireland is continuing to actively promote the Tullamore area as a location for new projects.</P>
    <P>At a more general level, the Government, through the enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution <Col N="617" /> of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. The development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In 2000, 589 new jobs were created by IDA Ireland assisted companies in the midlands region, resulting in a net gain for the year of 105 jobs. The total number of IDA Ireland jobs created in the midlands region amounts to 6,208. The increase in employment reflects how IDA Ireland's strategy to secure 50% of all greenfield projects for the Border, midlands and west region is beginning to show results.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's policy is to focus a major part of its efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas owned companies in this country. Through development programmes it operates, the aim is to have capable companies moving systematically up the value chain from being basically mandated subsidiary operations to being strategically independent operations within their corporate structures worldwide. A recent initiative being promoted by IDA Ireland in Birr is the promotion of the recently completed 17,707 sq. ft. BES factory on the Shannon Development site. Shannon Development, which has responsibility for developing indigenous industry in south-west Offaly, has reported an increase in employment in its client companies in indigenous industry of 5% in south Offaly during 2000.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland currently supports 144 client companies in the midlands region, employing 5,406 people mainly in the food, consumer products and industrial sectors. The agency's new regional development strategy, which was launched on 5 February, is the basis of Enterprise Ireland's response to both the job losses experienced in the Laois-Offaly area and the under-performance of the midlands region. The work of the agencies in bringing employment to the wider Offaly region will also benefit Tullamore. I will convey Deputy Quinn's views in relation to a meeting with the Tullamore task force to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this matter is to request that a feasibility study be carried out to establish the prospect of reopening the Collooney-Claremorris railway line. Such a study <Col N="618" /> could explore this regional resource and the possibilities offered by the restoration of the line.</P>
      <P>The western inter-county railway committee which is representative of the five county councils in Connacht and of all political parties has been actively engaged in a campaign to restore the Collooney-Claremorris line as part of the Sligo-Limerick route. The line has been closed to passengers since 1963 and to freight since 1975. The committee has published two detailed studies in support of the case for restoration &ndash; the Sligo-Limerick Railway by Dr. MacGreil in January 1981 and Sligo-Limerick-Rosslare Rail Link by European Consultancy Services in 1992. As a result of this research and the case made to successive Governments, the board of CIE and more recently to Iarnród Éireann, the committee succeeded in preventing the total abandonment of the line from Collooney to Claremorris. I praise the committee for its outstanding work in that regard.</P>
      <P>The section is an integral part of the cross-radial link between Sligo and Rosslare which serves the major container ports of Rosslare and Waterford. It also serves six towns and their communities &ndash; Collooney, Tubbercurry, Charlestown, Swinford, Kiltimagh and Claremorris. If improved access to and from Europe is to benefit the counties and the communities along the west coast, a direct multi-modal link to Shannon and Limerick and to Waterford and Rosslare is vital. In recent years, there has been strong support from development agencies in the counties along the line for the reopening of the closed section and a feasibility study in that regard is required.</P>
      <P>A common theme in the submissions from the north-west, west and mid-west areas for the current round of EU Structural Funds was the need to develop this route. Support from Europe for the cost of this study would be justified. The Construction Industry Federation in a submission to the Government proposed the development of a euro route from Sligo through Galway to Limerick and Rosslare. The study could also examine the benefits of tourism at regional and local level, access to the region, access from a region served by Knock and Sligo Airports, transport through the region, environmental advantages such as reductions in road traffic, accident reduction, energy savings and economic regeneration of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abandonment of the line would seriously diminish the value of the remainder of the Sligo-Limerick line and would deprive a relatively under-developed and peripheral region of an important developmental resource. Abandonment would also demonstrate a negative attitude to rail at a time of renewed EU interest in multi-modal and rail transport. I understand the Government is preparing to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on reopening the Dublin to Navan rail link. A fraction of what that will cost would bene<Col N="619" /> fit the west if it was spent on providing cross-radial rail transport from Sligo to Limerick and on to Waterford and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the west needs a significantly improved transport system because of the existing levels of traffic and the developmental requirements of the region. The research carried out illustrated these demands and a feasibility study would be justified. It would also address the difficulties that exist at present. The central response is to prioritise the upgrading of the rail system of which the Claremorris-Collooney line is an integral section as part of a programme of improvement of the total transport system in Ireland and particularly the west. A feasibility study would explore this regional resource.</P>
    <P>A similar service to the Arrow rail link in Kildare would open up huge possibilities for the region. Rail is a luxury way to travel and a reopened line would make a return on the investment by opening up the whole western seaboard. It would also offer potential for tourism development in Northern Ireland. I am not requesting funding now for reopening the line, but I ask the Minister to provide money for a feasibility study. A sum of between £45,000 and £50,000 would allow a thorough examination to be carried out. We are indebted to the committees which fought for the line and safeguarded it because it is a State asset. A feasibility study is now required to examine the viability of reopening the route. My view is that it would be viable and I hope the Minister will indicate that funding will be provided towards the cost of employing consultants to undertake the study.</P>

      <P>The Collooney-Claremorris line was closed completely in November 1975. The Government's commitment to the provision of regional transport infrastructure is evidenced by the investment programme set out in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The plan adopts a regional approach and makes provision for substantial investment in infrastructure to support sustainable and balanced development in the regions. Major investment is planned for all transportation modes to improve access in all the regions to domestic and international markets.</P>
      <P>Some £650 million will be spent on the regional public transport programme in the period to 2006. Of this, £500 million is earmarked for rail services. This includes a sum of £350 million for the continuation of the railway safety programme to 2006 and a further £150 million for non-safety related investment, such as the purchase of new rolling stock, the upgrading of railway stations and the renewal of railway plant and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, who unfortunately could not be present for this debate, has taken the view that the introduction or reinstatement of new rail lines and services, at the very <Col N="620" /> least, should not proceed in the absence of decisions taken by the appropriate authorities which would ensure that the land corridors bordering the track along the urban areas traversed by the line are zoned for a degree of development that would provide economic justification for the cost of the investment.</P>
    <P>The rail investment programme currently being implemented by Iarnród Éireann is the largest investment ever put into railways in Ireland. However, these resources are limited and must be utilised so that the best value for money is achieved for the public. Therefore, the investment programme is being implemented in a prioritised manner on the basis of rail safety, customer demand and expected economic return.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to the reopening of individual railway lines are matters for the boards of management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann. The Minister understands from Iarnród Éireann that it has no plans to carry out a feasibility study into the reopening of the Collooney to Claremorris line as the anticipated level of passenger carryings relative to the capital and operating costs would not justify such a service. Despite the good case put forward by the Deputy, I regret that the news is not more favourable at this time.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Bank Practices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of considerable concern not only to my constituents, but to many workers and pensioners throughout the country. A new system introduced before Christmas means that the banks will only deal with people who are properly registered account holders. Anyone who does not have an account in the bank has no business in expecting to engage in the transaction of any business because he or she will not succeed. His or her cheque will be non-negotiable unless he or she has an account to which to lodge the cheque. This change of practice is completely unacceptable. It is causing anxiety, upset, hardship and grave inconvenience for thousands of families throughout the country. I urge the Minister of State to use his undoubted influence with the banking industry to dissuade it from proceeding with this policy. Students, pensioners and public sector workers are worst hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many social welfare recipients and pensioners do not have bank accounts. I challenge the Minister of State or anyone else on any side of the House to state otherwise. These people are now being told the only way their cheques are negotiable is by way of lodgement directly to an account. By forcing people to open accounts in the way the four main banks now do, the banks cream off further profits which, in effect, is little short of exploitation of the weaker sections of the community. This highhanded practice, accompanied by the widespread closure of the <Col N="621" /> rural bank network, is anti-social and motivated exclusively and solely by profit margins.</P>
    <P>Thousands of public sector employees may now seek to be paid in cash, which would be an administrative headache as well as being an unsafe practice. Twenty years ago cash payments were discontinued when deemed a security risk, resulting in armed security officers of the State offering protection to private banks and private financial institutions. That has continued to this day. That bank security is still provided by the State should be acknowledged by the banks, in return for which they should meet the needs of their consumers by agreeing to the simple transaction of cashing a guaranteed cheque.</P>
    <P>There are 250,000 State employees and tens of thousands of pensioners who may well be justified in seeking a cash payment from the State if their cheques are to remain non-negotiable and are not cashed. The Government has a clear, legal and moral obligation to facilitate payment to its workers and the Minister for Finance needs to address this matter urgently. The Government must ensure that its mode of payment is honoured and that remuneration by way of guaranteed Government cheque is delivered to the appropriate person, namely, an employee of the State, who can negotiate and receive cash for that cheque. Current bank practices mean the cheque is of little or no value. It is merely a piece of paper and not a negotiable instrument.</P>
    <P>Banks have continued to return record profits in recent years earned by increased charges and higher interest rates and made mainly on the backs of vulnerable consumers. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, have a duty to assist in the resolution of this problem and both should act firmly and speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two largest banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, introduced a restriction on the encashment of cheques in bank branches towards the end of last year. The new procedures require, in general, that cheques be lodged to an account rather than be fully or partially cashed over the counter. The banks implemented this restriction for all private sector cheques, with some few exceptions, but the application to various categories of Government payments differs.</P>
      <P>Regarding social welfare payments, those made by way of a cheque are drawn on an account in the Bank of Ireland. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been assured by the Bank of Ireland that the bank will continue to encash those cheques as before. That Department is not aware of any particular difficulties encountered by its clients in cashing payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Almost all other Government payments are either made electronically or by way of payable orders drawn on the Office of the Paymaster General, which is part of the Department of Finance. The exception among Departments is the Office of Public Works, which issues its own payable orders drawn on an account in the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Bank of Ireland introduced the new procedures with effect from 13 November 2000, stating that the changes were necessary to ensure the bank complied with accepted European banking practices. In December 2000 Allied Irish Banks introduced similar procedures. However, AIB decided not to apply the restriction to Government payments and it continues to cash payable orders from the Office of Public Works and those drawn on the PMG. Pending discussions with the Department of Finance, Bank of Ireland postponed the application of this restriction on payable orders drawn on the Paymaster General's office and on the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance with a number of others had discussions with Bank of Ireland about aspects of its proposal, including the timing of its introduction, availability of funds for withdrawal once lodged and the exemption of payments to certain groups. In those discussions, Bank of Ireland made a number of alterations to its proposed procedures. It exempted payments to pensioners where these are made on a distinctive payable order form distinguishable from others. This means pensioners paid by the Paymaster General, which includes all civil servants, as well as those paid by other Departments, such as retired teachers, gardaí and Army personnel, may cash the pension payment over the counter if they so wish. That answers the point made by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>As for all other Government payable orders, Bank of Ireland insists the order be lodged in full to an account, but it does not require that the customer wait for the normal clearance period of several days for access to the funds. The bank has committed to making the money available by 9 p.m. that day at the latest for withdrawal through an ATM. This delay is for technical reasons relating to the bank's system and processes. Bank of Ireland decided to operate the new procedures on this basis for PMG payable orders from mid-March and for Office of Public Works orders from the end of March.</P>
    <P>The position with the other retail banks is as follows: AIB does not propose to apply the restriction to any PMG payable orders, Ulster Bank and TSB require the customer to lodge the payable order and await the normal clearance period of five days, and NIB will encash payable orders, but only for customers of the particular branch.</P>
    <P>The difficulties a number of staff have experienced since in cashing Government cheques was <Col N="623" /> raised by the Joint Industrial Council Group of Unions, representing State industrial employees, at a meeting of the council on Tuesday, 3 April 2001. The council, under the chairperson of an industrial relations officer nominated by the Labour Relations Commission, advised that a meeting be arranged between trade union representatives and employers to discuss the difficulties involved. A meeting has been arranged for tomorrow, Wednesday, 11 April, between employers and trade union representatives to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <P>The changes in encashment procedures have no effect on anyone whose salary is paid directly by electronic transfer into an account in a bank or building society. In that case, the funds are available from 7 a.m. on the payment date. This is increasingly becoming the norm, and in general it is desirable the banks utilise technology to improve retail payment systems. However, this should be done in partnership with the customers and the wider community and should take account of their wishes and concerns.</P>
    <P>The banks jointly made proposals in 1999 to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance regarding improvement of the retail payments systems. One of these related to the payment of the bills of utility companies and another to the establishment of what has been termed a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; account which would provide electronic payment options for people who do not have a payment account. Discussions have proceeded since between the banks and An Post to develop these proposals further, and an announcement is imminent on the first of these. I hope those discussions will be successful in devising a solution that meets both the need to harness technology to improve efficiency and to address the concerns of the public.</P>
    <P>The report on strategic issues facing the banking sector, which reported last year, recommended among other things that the banking industry develop a strategy to address the issue of maintaining appropriate mechanisms for and levels of access to banking services. It also recommended that the regulatory authority for the financial services sector should monitor and report on this from a customer perspective. Since that report, the Government has decided to establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority as a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. It will be appropriate for the new authority to consider the recommendation of the report on access to banking services. As it will combine the different aspects of regulation in one organisation, it will be in a position to consider the matter both from the customer's perspective and in terms of the overall banking system. It is the intention that the new authority will be established as soon as possible. I hope it will be the beginning of 2002.</P>

To see a collection of this material is very worthwhile and interesting and all sorts of documents and facts emerge from it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an abuse of privilege by this Government. It blatantly promotes the achievements of this Government and, in many instances, draws false and misleading comparisons with previous Administrations. The banner headline in this publication declares: &ldquo;We have delivered on our promises&rdquo;. Since when did the Department of Finance get into the business of making promises to anybody and how could it deliver on them? This is an unprecedented publication. The subtitle of the Department of Finance is used to give credibility to a flawed propaganda publication. This document, prepared and funded by the Department of Finance, obviously at the discretion of their political masters, is a blatant abuse of taxpayers' money and a blatant attempt to portray the information contained in it as impartial, unbiased and accurate.</P>
      <P>I understand that the design, printing and layout costs of this publication are about £6,000, paid to outside organisations. There are further costs to consider, the internal costs such as Civil Service working time, assembling of material for this publication, photographic and other material from other Departments. These costs, if factored in, run to further thousands of pounds. It is a terrible abuse of privilege by this Government that civil servants should be directed to provide such outrageous material and I am sure it is a major embarrassment to many of them to be told to write this kind of stuff. The document contains 12 photographs of Ministers or Ministers of State, the league table of which runs as follows: Taoiseach two, Tánaiste two, Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, two, Ministers Walsh, O'Rourke, Dempsey and McDaid, one each and Ministers of State Hanafin and Ryan, one each.</P>

      <P>This is where I come to the inaccuracies. On page seven, under the heading &ldquo;Just Look at our Record&rdquo;, the document refers to personal allowances &ndash; incidentally I thought personal allowances were abolished and that we now had tax credits &ndash; and it notes the recent changes in this area comparing it to the record of the Rainbow Coalition. I find it absolutely disgusting that the conclusion drawn is that the increases of personal allowances introduced by the current Government to date are almost five times greater than those introduced by the previous Government. That is blatantly untrue and it is shameful that such untruths should appear in a document masquerading as a publication from the Department of Finance. The £550 pounds increase by the Rainbow Coalition, allowable at the marginal rate which for many was 48%, was in fact worth £264. The £2,600 increase by this Government is worth £520 as a tax credit and even a primary school student would know that £520 is not almost five times £264, in fact, it is even less than twice that amount.</P>

This document has been distributed to all second level schools at the taxpayers' expense and I question the provisional legislation to allow a database, held in the Department of Education and Science, to be available for political electioneering. Will this spending be included in declared election expenses and, if not, why not?

The newspaper also has easy to read pie charts showing how the Government will raise the tax revenue next year and showing how it will be spent. There are also articles in relation to improvements in the transport, tourism, sport and housing areas and also on the positive changes for children. There were no outside consultants involved in sourcing or producing copy or content for the newspaper and printing was put out to tender by the Department of Finance.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who are resident in the State and who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and, where there is a shortfall in a person's income, a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>Payments are made where a person has no means to meet their immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where they are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or a health board payment. Under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, certain categories of people are already excluded. These include people in full-time education, in full-time employment or engaged in trade disputes. The legislation also provides for exceptions to these exclusions. For example, people on specified education or training courses may be eligible to retain entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. In addition, people in full-time employment who are in receipt of back to work allowance may also be eligible to retain entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Restricting eligibility for the scheme further or limiting the period of payment in any way would, in the first instance, require a change in the legislation governing the scheme. I have no plans to introduce any such changes at this time. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. This review is examining all aspects of the scheme including eligibility criteria.</P>

      <P>In line with the Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions, in recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme. The reduction in 1997 in the average yearly number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten was particularly significant in this regard. Arrangements were also introduced to cater for particular groups who would not otherwise qualify for a pension. These include the special pension introduced in budget 2000 for those with pre-1953 insurance and the self-employed pension introduced in 1999. In both cases, at least five years contributions are required and the pension is paid at 50% of the full personal, qualified adult and child rate.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Pro rata</i> pensions exist in the social welfare system for those with mixed insurance records and with insurance from other countries. These pensions also require a certain degree of insurance and, in general, the basic qualifying conditions which apply to pensions must still be satisfied. However, the contributions assessed can be a mixture of different rates or contributions from other countries. The rate of pension payable is in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age contributory and retirement pensions in this country.</P>
      <P>I consider it reasonable to expect people to attain a certain level of contributions over their working career to qualify for a contributory-based pension. From an equity perspective, a certain contribution threshold must apply. This not only upholds the social insurance principle, firmly supported by successive Governments, but also affirms the expectations and entitlements of those who have a history of strong attachment to social insurance. In the circumstances, a minimum standard must apply and I would not consider it appropriate that pensions should be paid to people who do not meet this minimum standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions and the Deputy will recall that I published the first phase of this review in August last year. One of the proposals of the first phase report involves a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average yearly contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid or credited over a person's working life. This would represent a significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, in principle, <Col N="631" /> such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the public.</P>
    <P>Phase two of the review, which is under way, is examining this proposal in more detail with particular reference to cost and operational issues and the appropriate number of contributions which might be required for pension purposes. I expect to receive the phase two report later this year and will consider its proposals in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I have felt for some time that the original school meals scheme falls far short of what is required. I do not consider that a simple expansion of that scheme would meet the needs of today's schoolgoing children in an efficient or effective manner. Accordingly, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the existing scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision.</P>
      <P>As part of the review, my officials engaged in a wide ranging consultation exercise. This included meeting with and visiting some of those involved in new school meals initiatives at local level. The overwhelming area of concern identified by these projects was the lack of State funding and I decided that an immediate response was required. Pending completion of the review, I provided £300,000 interim funding under a new scheme, the school meals community programme. This funding is intended to meet the food costs of the voluntary and community based groups that are currently operating innovative school meals projects outside the original scheme. This funding is provided to existing initiatives that are targeting areas of disadvantage or children with special needs and it is available on a nationwide basis to primary and secondary schools.</P>
      <P>To date, the funding has been allocated to 41 projects and will benefit approximately 4,150 children. In addition, a further 25 applications are currently on hand and decisions in relation to these will be made shortly. Inquiries have also been received from a further 12 projects. I expect to receive the working group's report in the summer, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other services. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I set up a working group last year comprising representatives from relevant Departments to examine this and related issues. This group is evaluating the adequacy of the current payment rates to asylum seekers in direct provision. It has sought and received submissions from various statutory and non-statutory agencies and organisations. These will be considered and together with data from relevant sources such as the household budget survey, they provide a sound basis upon which to reach a conclusion on this matter. I understand the group will report its findings and recommendations to me shortly.</P>

      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, commenced its work in December 2000. The group's membership comprises representatives from the social partners and Government Departments. It is chaired by an independent chairperson, Professor Kieran Kennedy, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group are drawn <Col N="633" /> from the PPF and require it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and to examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
    <P>I am advised that an interim report is currently in course of preparation by the group. This interim report is intended to provide a broad outline of the work carried out by the group to date, the types of issues that are being considered and the work that remains to be done. I understand the group intends to finalise the interim report when it meets again later this month. The interim report will be made publicly available as soon as possible thereafter. I understand the group is aiming to complete its deliberations by the end of July 2001 and to present its final report shortly thereafter.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's question refers to appointments to relevant bodies comprising people from outside the Civil Service. Since July 1997, I have appointed 75 such people to statutory bodies under the aegis of my Department, that is, the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle and the Social Welfare Tribunal. Of these 32 &ndash; 43% &ndash; were women and 43 &ndash; 57% &ndash; were men. In addition, some 190 people were nominated to nine working groups or committees. Of these, 85 &ndash; 45% &ndash; were women and 105 &ndash; 55% were men. A detailed gender breakdown for all such appointments is contained in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The current membership of such bodies comprises 161 people of whom 69 &ndash; 43% &ndash; are women and 92 &ndash; 57% &ndash; are men. This is in line with established Government policy for a minimum representation &ndash; 40% &ndash;  of men and women on State boards.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the national longitudinal study of children especially in relation to children living in areas of high disadvantage.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>A national longitudinal study is a comprehensive study, focusing on a significant number of children, which examines their progress and well-being at critical periods from birth to adulthood. By studying a representative sample of children over a period of time, it is possible to identify the key factors which protect children in times of adversity and most help and encourage their development.</P>
      <P>The case for a longitudinal study was made by the Commission on the Family in its report to the Government, Strengthening Families for Life, published in July 1998. Such a study of children was also identified under the national children's strategy, Our Children &ndash; Their Lives, as a key measure to achieve the national goal that &ldquo;children's lives will be better understood&rdquo;. As was highlighted in the national children's strategy, such a study would identify the persistent adverse effects which lead to social disadvantage and exclusion, educational difficulties, ill-health and deprivation.</P>
      <P>Following a proposal from the Minister for Health and Children and myself, the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion approved the undertaking of a feasibility study by my Department jointly with the Department of Health and Children to explore what would be involved in undertaking such a study of children in Ireland. The contract to carry out the feasibility project and develop a design for a national longitudinal study has been awarded to the Consortium of Researchers in Ireland. The consortium represents a number of leading academic and research institutions nationwide, including TCD, UCD, the ESRI and the Institute of Public Health in Dublin, UCC in Cork, NUI in Galway and a range of disciplines in such fields as health, education, social research, developmental psychology and social change.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board, which is assisting both Departments in the managing of the project, has advised that the contract is due to be signed shortly. The work of the consortium is expected to be completed in three months and I expect to be in a position to bring its recommendations as to how a full study might be carried out to the Cabinet sub-committee for consideration in early autumn. The Government allocated £500,000 in budget 2001 for this project.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to the significant estimated increase in the budget for rent supplement in 2001, he will outline the number of families dependent on rent supplement in 2001; and if he will bring further proposals to Government in that regard.</Quest>

      <P>The estimate for expenditure on rent supplements in 2001 is £134 million. The expenditure on rent supplements in 2000 was £118.7 million. The estimated increased expenditure on rent supplements in 2001 is due entirely to increases in the cost of private rented accommodation. There are 42,536 recipients of rent supplements, a slight reduction on the 42,884 in the same week in 2000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that a full range of housing options is made available to people with long-term housing needs who rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined, including the rent supplement issue, and opportunities for making these expenditures more effective will be carefully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999. The scheme was designed to replace the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme and the means test for the scheme was more favourable than the unemployment assistance means test.</P>
      <P>Arising from improvements which I made in the scheme in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, income, including any off-farm self-employment income, is assessed at 70% for the purposes of the means test. In addition, £200 is disregarded for each of the first two children and £300 for each subsequent child in families.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 2001, there were 7,880 farm assist claims in payment receiving on average £94.72 per week. Of these, some 5,000 are former smallholders who are now in receipt of farm assist and receive an average of approximately £105 per week. New applicants to farm assist receive an average payment of approximately £85 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers, particularly for those with children, and makes a valu<Col N="639" /> able contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 64, 66 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear at the outset that employees who are laid off as a result of the foot and mouth disease may qualify for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance subject to satisfying the usual conditions for receipt of payment. Those conditions include being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>In regard to claims for unemployment payments arising from the foot and mouth crisis, deciding officers in my Department would have regard to the temporary nature of the layoffs in question, to the expectation that employment will be resumed once relevant restrictions are eased or lifted, and to the fact that, in the circumstances, the persons concerned may not have had a chance to consider other employment opportunities. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also add that, in the event that a person does not qualify for an unemployment payment or is awaiting a decision on the claim, he or <Col N="640" /> she can apply for supplementary welfare allowance at their local health centre and the community welfare officer will assess them on the basis of their current circumstances and immediate needs.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the waiting period, under social welfare legislation, a person who claims unemployment benefit is not normally paid for the first three days, which are known as waiting days. Such waiting days have always been a feature of the system and it would not be appropriate to treat those laid off as a result of foot and mouth disease differently from workers laid off for any other reason. Where, however, the person had a claim in respect of the scheme within the previous 13 weeks, payment may be made from the first day of the claim. I emphasise, however, that people who need financial support are not left without such support during the waiting period. A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost implications, at this stage it is not possible to estimate accurately the likely cost of this crisis on the social welfare budget. The impact on the budget will depend on the future course of the disease and particularly the length of time that the adverse economic effects of the disease continue. Recently, there have been positive signs that the disease and its impact might be contained. In the meantime, it is my view that the existing range of social welfare income support measures provides the necessary safety net for the different categories of customers in need of the services of my Department.</P>

    <P>An outline format for the national action plans was agreed by the EU Social Protection Committee on 19 January. A seminar with officials from the relevant services of the European Commission was held on 28 March to have an open <Col N="641" /> exchange of information and debate with relevant stakeholders in Ireland and the Commission about the process of co-ordination on social inclusion and the preparation of the national action plans.</P>
    <P>Representatives of relevant stakeholders in Ireland attended. These included representatives of Departments, social partners and relevant agencies, such as the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI. Representatives of the social partners outlined what they considered should be provided for in the national action plan.</P>
    <P>Following on from this seminar, the preparation and drafting of the national action plan has intensified. This involves using the administrative structures and the processes for consultation already in place for the national anti-poverty strategy, and for the review of that strategy taking place in accordance with the partnership agreement. The Combat Poverty Agency also has a key role in drafting elements of the plan.</P>
    <P>Departments had been asked to submit work plans for the period 2001 to 2003 and examples of best practice to the national anti-poverty unit. The recent advertisement in the national newspapers requesting submissions on the NAPS review provided a further opportunity for stakeholders to express their views on national anti-poverty policies. Each of these submissions will be considered as part of the national plan process.</P>
    <P>With these preparations in place, I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to meet the 1 June deadline for submission of a national action plan promoting social inclusion which will be fully in line with all the requirements set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent quarterly national household survey figures were released by the Central Statistics Office on 21 February 2001. According to these figures there was a fall of 19,900 or 20% (from 88,700 to 68,800) in the unemployment rate in the year to November 2000. This represents a national unemployment rate of 3.9% and a drop of 90,200 (57%) since June 1997.</P>
      <P>The largest decreases were recorded in the Border and Dublin areas with decreases of 5,100 cases each. On a percentage basis the largest decreases were in the Border and south-east areas with 34% and 28% respectively. The unemployment rate in the three areas is higher than the national rate of 3.9%. It stands at 4.7% in the midlands, 4.9% in the south-east and 5.4% in the Border area. However, there have been significant percentage decreases in these areas in recent years.</P>
      <P>Fluctuations in QNHS figures in rural areas cannot be compared to the larger urban areas, where the buoyant economy and greater job opportunities impact more quickly on unemployment levels. In addition, certain counties in the midlands have been hit by some large scale redundancies in the past 12 months which would have a negative influence on unemployment levels in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, we have, through the efforts of our employment support services, continued to assist the long-term unemployed to leave the live register and return to the active labour force. A number of special projects have been undertaken in the Border, midlands and south-east areas by my Department's jobs facilitators, usually in partnership with other local agencies and community based organisations. These range from training pro<Col N="643" /> grammes, business support schemes, IT training and back to education courses. In addition, local offices of the Department give information to unemployed people about local job vacancies and educational opportunities. They also invite other relevant agencies to visit the offices and provide information first hand on their services to customers when they are signing on.</P>

      <P>The main focus of research on benefit take up in Ireland has been the family income supplement scheme where a number of findings indicated that the level of take up of the scheme was low. In the light of that assessment, specific measures were put in place to improve the level of awareness of the scheme and thus promote an increased take up.</P>
      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. The underlying objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements under a broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</P>
      <P>Staff of my Department participate at public events, promoting all social welfare schemes and advising people on their entitlements. In addition, they provide lectures to a range of organisations, such as employer groups, pre-retirement and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>My Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme and these are widely available at local level from my Department, from post offices and from other organisations. New schemes, changes and improvements to existing schemes and services are advertised, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, Aertel, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. Selective use is also made of freephone services to provide information and advice on the introduction of new schemes or, for example, at budget time. The public can also access information on social welfare schemes and services through the Department's website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the next few months, a mailshot will issue to every household in the country outlining my Department's main schemes and the changing role of the Department. The Comhairle agency <Col N="644" /> was established in June 2000 and comes within the remit of my Department. It was formed through a merger of the former National Social Services Board and the former National Rehabilitation Board and provides independent information, advice and other supports to citizens, including people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to late claims and payment of arrears in such cases, I have made a number of improvements to the provisions relating to late social welfare claims, whereby the back dating period has been extended from three months to six or 12 months in most cases and can be backdated further in certain circumstances. The provisions relating to late claims have been subjected to close scrutiny in recent years. There is a general obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations.</P>

      <P>Fraud and abuse of the social welfare system can arise in a number of different ways, for example, where people claiming social welfare payments make false declarations or conceal material facts to obtain payment, personation, concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments, failure by an employer to comply with PRSI obligations, etc.</P>
      <P>My Department has a comprehensive range of arrangements in place to ensure that fraud and abuse is kept to a minimum and that only those who are entitled to a payment actually receive it. All Department staff who are involved in making payments are aware of and concerned with the prevention of incorrect payments and the detection of abuse and there are some 600 staff who are specifically involved in control activity either as members of scheme control units, investigators and medical assessors.</P>
      <P>The total amount of savings from control activities during 2000 was approximately £214 million. The main areas in which savings arose were unemployment payments (£107 million), sickness payments (£36 million); pensions, including one parent family payments, (£53 million), and recovery of unpaid PRSI contributions (£10.4 million).</P>

The total number of prosecutions in respect of employees and employers finalised in court during the year 2000 was 213 and a conviction was obtained in all except 14 of these cases. A total of 28 employers were convicted in respect of failing to pay PRSI arrears, failing to provide information, failing to maintain records and for obstructing a social welfare inspector and there was one successful prosecution of an employer for collusion.</P>

The task force brought together representatives from all the relevant agencies and is chaired by a senior official of my Department. The task force has met on three occasions and is holding a further meeting today in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>A number of key issues have been highlighted by the task force. These include the question of income support for those affected, including farmers and other self-employed people, as well as employees laid off for the duration of the crisis. In this regard a special clinic has been set up to assist people with information, including information about the services, and in making claims where appropriate. Community welfare officers are dealing with cases of urgent financial need and are processing applications for supplementary welfare allowance on site. The question of counselling services for the farming community and others affected is also being addressed.</P>
      <P>The task force is also addressing other issues such as the loss of skilled workers in companies forced to lay off employees on a temporary basis, the alleviation of financial hardship for companies affected, the impact on tourism in County Louth in general and the Cooley peninsula in particular, and the progression of ongoing infrastructural improvements, urban renewal and environmental improvements during the crisis.</P>
      <P>The task force is continuing its work and will be making a report to me very shortly.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appro<Col N="647" /> priate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.</P>
    <P>People on approved schemes such as those mentioned by the Deputy can retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000, substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. As a result, many participants in community employment (CE) schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance. All CE recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance described earlier, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>Eligibility to retain entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplement was also extended to job initiative participants. Claims for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplement that were rejected because the claimant was participating in the job initiative scheme were reviewed and put into payment with effect from 6 April 2000 subject to the relevant conditions being met.</P>
    <P>The conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 65, 69, 223, 231 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. Based on the research carried out in the review, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At the end of March 2001, there were 16,854 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 34% of full-time carers are in receipt of carer's allowance which is an increase of 83% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million this year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget for 2001, in addition to substantial rate increases, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from this month in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. It <Col N="649" /> is estimated that this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple earning up to £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance plus the free schemes and respite care grant in each case.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. This improvement represents another move towards what I consider to be the optimum situation, which is that all carers whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate. It is estimated that in the region of £180 million would be required per annum to abolish the means test and pay the basic maximum rate carer's allowance to the estimated 33,000 carers who are not in receipt of a carer's allowance. Given the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider the complete abolition of the means test to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources, but I will keep the issue under review.</P>
    <P>The review considered that the objectives of the carer's allowance scheme are designed for full-time carers and that part-time caring situations were not therefore covered by these objectives. The rationale underlying the full-time care and attention requirement for carer's allowance is to ensure that the care recipient, who has been medically certified as being in need of full-time care and attention for more than 12 months, actually receives this care and attention. However, in practice, many carers care for less than 12 months because the care recipient may move into institutional care or may die. Care recipients may attend approved rehabilitation courses and may attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities without affecting the allowance payable to the carer. In situations where the care recipient engages in rehabilitative employment, each application is assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The review addressed the issues of differing care needs and it proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency. To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the <Col N="650" /> continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context taking account of our key priorities in the care area as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the situation whereby a person in receipt of a widow's pension cannot receive carer's allowance at the same time.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual at any given time. This is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> The review of the carer's allowance published in October 1998 examined the question of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The review noted that the allowance is an income support and not a payment for caring. It concluded that the practice of paying only one allowance should continue. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive whichever payment is most beneficial.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people and carers will be kept under review in the context of overall budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>The United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, also known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. On the 5 December 2000, leading on from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I launched the National Committee on Volunteering under the chairmanship of Deputy Chris Flood. This committee has a total membership of 38 and members are drawn from relevant Departments, including mine, universities with related research or training roles, business and industry, foundations, leading NGOs and community and voluntary groups together with some individuals in a personal capacity. A budget of £1 million has been allocated to the workings of the National Committee on Volunteering.</P>
      <P>The committee has made significant progress in its work to date. Due to the size of the committee, quite an amount of its day to day work is being carried out at sub-committee level. To date, the chairman has established four sub committees to address specific issues in relation to volunteering, the International Year of Volunteers and a grants sub committee has set aside £350,000 from the £1 million for a grant scheme to mark the year. As part of my Department's direct contribution to IYV 2001, a one-day seminar was organised on 29 March on the importance of social capital. The seminar was opened by me, was addressed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and included a number of prominent international and Irish speakers. More than 100 from the voluntary-community sector, the business community, trade unions and universities attended and, by all accounts, enjoyed the seminar.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September, during which time approved students will be allowed undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour, giving a possible total maximum payment of £600. As usual, the scheme will be advertised shortly in the national and college newspapers. The level of interest in the scheme by students has been declining over the past few years due, no doubt, to the wider availability of summer jobs. The allocation for the scheme for the year 2001 is £3.5 million. This reflects the drop in the anticipated level of appli<Col N="653" /> cations expected from students this year. There has been no cutback in the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a number of improvements in the scheme this year. To focus resources on the less well-off students, I have decided that an extra £1 per hour will be paid to those students who parents are solely dependent on social welfare payments. This will enable them to earn an extra £200 if they work the maximum number of hours allowed under the scheme. In addition, approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension will be eligible to participate in the scheme this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>The range of free schemes operated by my Department include the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes. These are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From May, the free schemes are available to all persons aged over 70 years, regardless of income or household composition.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, in April last year, examined the issue of extending <Col N="654" /> the free schemes to include other items of expenditure. The review considers that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package of necessary household benefits that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It notes that it is not the business of my Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure and recommends that no further goods and services be covered by the free schemes unless there are clear social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    <P>The conversion of aerials could not in my view be deemed to be in this category. The review examines a large number of issues, some of which pertain to the free travel scheme. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in the report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered, on my Department's behalf, by the community welfare service in the health boards. An interdepartmental working group is currently reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service, of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the review is now nearing completion. This involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. A total of 145 submissions were received from users of the SWA service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners, the health boards who administer the scheme and the trade unions representing community welfare officers. These submissions are currently being considered and will inform the deliberations of the interdepartmental working group.</P>
      <P>A further meeting of the working group is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 10 April and I expect that the proposals of the group will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>From time to time consultants are commissioned by my Department to carry out specific assignments in relation to policy issues, or to aspects of the administration of the Department's schemes and services. The cost of external consultancies during 2000 amounted to £1,849 million. Estimated expenditure on consultancies for 2001 is £11,451 million, accounting for the 519% increase over actual spend for 2000 referred to by the Deputy. This increase is, in the main, attributed to one major project being undertaken this year. A new service delivery model which will modernise and personalise the way customers interact with my Department by providing a flexible, personalised and case-driven approach to customer service is being developed. This project will also enable my Department to deliver on commitments under the Government action plan for the information society. Consult<Col N="656" /> ants have been engaged to assist in identifying the appropriate changes to both the organisational and information technology structures to facilitate new service delivery mechanisms. The consultancy element of this project is estimated at £8 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>The balance of the estimated spend on consultancy this year relates to a number of other projects including projects arising from the Department's preparation for the introduction of the euro, the White Paper on voluntary activities, projects to improve the Department's central records system, implementation of a new computing environment and projects arising in the area of family policy.</P>

      <P>On 2 April 2001, I announced, in the context of the 2001 Estimates, a labour market support package which included a number of initiatives in the area of child care. These initiatives, which will be implemented by FÁS, include a £50 per week per child allowance for people seeking training to help them back into the workplace; the development of an introductory training course in child care for lone parents which will offer progression opportunities towards certified traineeship in childcare, and; a fund which will be available to FÁS to encourage child care providers to release personnel for certified training.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on these new initiatives in 2001, is estimated at £4.28 million. FÁS is currently finalising details of these programmes with a view to early implementation. Accordingly, FÁS is not yet in a position to furnish a breakdown of applications by county.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the £250 million funding under the national development plan for the equal opportunities child care programme. Questions regarding the administration of those funds should be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>Under the Equal Status Act, 2000, an individual who considers that he or she has experienced discrimination, within the meaning of the Act, may refer a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation or mediation. Areas of potential discrimination are age or sex of an individual. The underwriting criteria used by insurers are normally based on their experience of underwriting particular risks. This includes trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular segments of risks of the insurance market and classes of risk and are a matter for judgment by individual private <Col N="658" /> insurance companies. The application of loadings to quotations would likewise reflect an insurer's interpretation of the risk involved. The Equal Status Act, 2000, allows differences in the treatment of persons in relation to annuities, pensions, insurance policies or any other matters related to the assessment of risk where the treatment is affected by reference to actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely, or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and is reasonable having regard to the data or other relevant factors.</P>

      <P>The underwriting criteria used by insurers are normally based on their experience of underwriting particular risks. This includes trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular segments of risks of the insurance market and classes of risk are a matter for judgment by individual private insurance companies. Having regard to the different quotations given to male and female drivers, I understand that statistics supplied by the National Roads Authority indicate that there is a far higher incidence of road accidents among young male drivers than females. In 1999, in the 18 to 34 age group, 63 male drivers were killed and 1,225 males injured while the corresponding figures for female drivers indicate that five were killed and 710 females were injured. These statistics suggest that younger male drivers pose a greater underwriting risk than their female counterparts.</P>
      <P>I established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998, to examine the factors that influence the cost of motor insurance in particular, the relationship between the premiums being levied on different categories of drivers and the claims experience of those categories. The difference in the rating criteria for males and females will be one of the issues to be included in the final report to be submitted to me, by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Deloitte and Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland was commissioned in June 1995 and received in October 1996. The principal recommendations of the report regarding liability insurance are as follows. The report recommends initiatives that small firms and community-voluntary groups should take to improve claims experience and reduce insurance costs; the Health and Safety Authority to be strengthened to near the same relative level in terms of resources and powers as the Health and Safety Executive in the UK; FÁS to co-operate with the HSA in the provision of risk manage<Col N="660" /> ment and training; and a date to be set for a review of a proposal recommending a legal basis for employers liability insurance. Regarding personal injury compensation the report recommends the establishment, subject to detailed examination, of a personal injuries tribunal to deal, by agreement between plaintiff and defendant, with small claims where liability is not at issue; guidelines for general damages awards in personal injury cases to be drawn up by a specialist panel on behalf of the Judiciary, appropriate to Irish tradition and case law; measures to effect greater transparency in court and more efficient use of pre-trial procedures in personal injury cases &ndash; these measures are put forward for consideration by the various courts committees and are directed mainly for consideration by the Department of Justice; solicitors' no-foul-no-fee advertisements to advise plaintiffs in writing before a claim is lodged that the plaintiff may incur costs if the action fails; and improve consultation between insurers and other interested groups by agreeing guidelines for processing claims. Relating to private motor insurance, it states to evaluate an Ontario initiative on graduated licensing for learner drivers with a view to examining its feasibility in an Irish context; and to introduce driving-related subjects as a transition year topic in secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Other recommendations relate to improving the monitoring of liability and motor insurance costs and their contributory factors.</P>

      <P>I launched the report of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying today, Tuesday 10 April, 2001. This report represents a comprehensive examination of the issue of workplace bullying and provides us with valuable data on the nature, scope and scale of the problem. The report has made a number of recommendations relating to actions which should be undertaken at both State and at enterprise level, to address workplace bullying. The principal recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating agency, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority. The purpose of the codes of practice will be to provide guidance on putting in place policies and procedures at the <Col N="661" /> level of individual enterprises and to provide a reference point for the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, charged with offering advice and assistance. The advisory committee will have a key role in co-ordinating and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations relating to the State's role in responding to workplace bullying, including the three codes of practice. The proposed membership of the advisory committee will include representation from the main State agencies and bodies currently dealing with workplace equality, welfare and labour relations issues in addition to IBEC and ICTU, who were also represented on the task force itself. I have asked all parties to the recommendations to advance the implementation of the recommendations as soon as possible. I also ask individual employers and enterprises to take on board the recommendations in the report which directly concern them, and to put in place, appropriate anti-bullying measures without delay. The continued involvement of, and co-operation from, IBEC and ICTU will greatly assist in this matter.</P>

      <P>The recent release of the interim report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, has provoked much debate on the statistical basis for the insurance industry's argument that young drivers are a very high risk category. However, it is important to note that at the time that this report was prepared, the MIAB recognised that the raw data available to it was incomplete. The board emphasised at that time, and since, that the indicators in the report could not be regarded as conclusions. The insurance industry has recently agreed to provide verified data to the board's <Col N="662" /> statistician who will carry out a detailed analysis of it. The board's final report is expected by the end of this year and its recommendations are awaited with great interest. In the light of those recommendations, I will consider what further action is appropriate to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it would appear desirable that there be greater transparency in the underwriting and pricing of motor insurance. However, it should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law limits the extent to which we can intervene in the pricing and underwriting of insurance in this country.</P>

      <P>Following the closure of the Betatherm Ireland Limited plant in Ballinrobe I established an inter agency task force for Ballinrobe under the chairmanship of the Mayo County Manager, with a view to focusing on the generation and attraction of new business opportunities in the area.</P>
      <P>The task force undertook a study concerning the 35 employees of the former Betatherm Ireland Limited. Some 30 employees responded to the questionnaire and it was discovered that, of these 30, 17 have found employment.</P>
      <P>The task force has held five formal meetings to date and in addition to this the chairman maintains regular contact with the group and receives updates from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Mayo County Enterprise Board.</P>
      <P>The development agencies' commitment to the Border, midlands and west regions has meant that promotional efforts are being redoubled for these areas including Ballinrobe. There have been significant increases in employment in south Mayo since the setting up of the task force.</P>

My Department has not, to date, received any proposals from Cork County Council in relation to this pier. Any proposals which the local authority wishes to put forward will receive careful consideration, having regard to the overall development needs of fishery harbours generally and the funding available for such works.</P>

      <P>In common with other food producing industries the fish farming sector makes use as necessary of veterinary medicinal products under EU Directives to combat and control disease and parasites. The total quantity of medicines used in aquaculture is relatively small and the ongoing priority for the industry remains the constant enhancement of fish husbandry strategies and farm management, notably fallowing, to prevent or minimise fish disease in the first place. These ongoing improvements combined with improved disease control regulations have seen a corresponding reduction in the use of treatments.</P>

    <P>Sampling and monitoring programmes carried out by the Marine Institute under EU and national regulatory frameworks encompass fish health status, testing for compliance with residue levels and environmental impact. These pro<Col N="665" /> grammes are kept under regular review in line with EU and national developments to ensure that the highest quality and food safety standards, and best environmental practice are complied with by the industry and to maintain the high reputation of Irish aquaculture products on export markets.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are 2.72 million currently valid Irish passports in circulation. Entitlement to citizenship under Irish law is generous by comparison with citizenship law in other countries. It includes people married to Irish citizens for at least three years, grandchildren, and in some cases great-grandchildren, of people born in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is not possible therefore to give a reasonable accurate estimate of the number of passport holders who were actually born on the island of Ireland. However, we estimate that about 705,000 passports were issued by Irish Embassies and Consulates abroad &ndash; about 430,000 by the Embassy of Ireland in London and about 275,000 by our other missions &ndash; and the remainder by the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.</P>

      <P>The technology to harness wind energy as a means of electricity generation is reasonably proven. The constraints on the technology are chiefly the random nature of the energy source; planning consent issues; connections to the electricity network and the ability of the network to absorb the output while maintaining security of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have set a target to support the construction of an additional 500 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating capacity by 2005. It is recognised that the bulk of this new capacity will come from wind energy sources. As with previous support measures suitable renew<Col N="666" /> able energy projects will be identified in a competitive process.</P>
    <P>In that competitive process the ESB may be an applicant. It would therefore be inappropriate to discuss the detail of any future competitive process with it. In dealings concerning future programmes to support electricity production from renewable energy sources, my officials maintain contact with the ESB only to the extent necessary to address grid connection issues and the ability of the network to absorb the increased output from the revised targets that I have set.</P>

      <P>As part of its ongoing work, Bord Gáis Éireann is currently examining a range of options for extending the natural gas network, including to the North West. It has engaged consultants to assist it in this regard. I expect that this analysis will be finalised shortly and will be the first step in clarifying the options for the extension to the north west.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that the extension of the gas network to the north west will most likely require external funding, the level of which would depend on the route of such extension. The application of such funding to the project will most likely have to be through an open transparent process and the project will be subject to the usual regulatory requirements and any EU clearance that may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Major gas pipeline projects such as this usually take about three years from conception through to completion. I intend that the necessary arrangements for the extension of the gas network to the North West will be put in place as quickly as possible after the routes have been decided upon and that the project will be completed in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, £21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to £147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
      <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 closed on 22 September 2000. My Department received 28 applications for funding under this call. These were assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants.

      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 all major refurbishment projects at bus and rail stations, together with purchases of trains and buses will take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers. Specifically, all new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be made accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all light rail vehicles, including LUAS, and suburban railcars financed under the plan will also be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all buses purchased by CIE from 2000 for use on urban services will be low floor.</P>
      <P>All three of the CIE operating companies &ndash; Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann &ndash; have established disability users groups to advise them on accessibility issues. Up to now, low floor wheelchair accessible buses have been acquired exclusively for urban services. However, I am happy that Bus Éireann has now purchased low floor wheelchair accessible buses for use on a trial basis on rural services. The results of the trials will then be used as a basis for determining future purchases.</P>
      <P>I established the Public Transport Accessibility Committee in July 2000. The committee is composed of representatives of organisations representing the elderly, the disabled and mobility impaired, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and the Light Rail Project Office. It will advise me on public transport accessibility in general and, where appropriate, make recommendations for prioritised, cost effective measures to address these issues.</P>
      <P>I have no function in relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy. This is a day to day matter for CIE Tours International.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus operates the following procedures to accommodate persons with disabilities: aircraft specifications require that a certain number of seats are accessible for wheelchair passengers; provision is made for the carriage of wheelchairs; toilets on long range aircraft are wheelchair accessible; special wheelchairs are made available to conform with aisle widths on aeroplanes; passengers unable to walk are transferred to aircraft by paramedics.</P>
      <P>With regard to Aer Rianta, it is the company's policy to ensure that the design and provision of facilities at the three State airports are user friendly and accessible to all, including persons with disabilities.</P>

It is intended that the community and voluntary sector would undertake these projects. Over £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the Information Society Fund over the period June 2001 to December 2002.

It is anticipated that the results of the first stage of the selection process will be posted to all project co-ordinators shortly.</P>

    <P>Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources.

      <P>I have no function in the administration of the Irish Red Cross Society. I do not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs.

      <Quest>the position regarding proposals made by the Irish Medicines Board that all ruminant vaccines be reclassified as prescription only; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10455/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation of the veterinary vaccines market is covered by a comprehensive body of legislation at both EU and national levels, namely, Council Directive 81/851 EEC and the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996. Under the aforementioned national legislation, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is designated as competent authority as regards approval of individual vaccines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary impetus for changes in the licensing regime in Ireland was the fact that existing licences no longer met the requirements of EU legislation, not least because they did not designate a legally binding route of supply for each product. It was, therefore, necessary to fully review all vaccines on the Irish market. Under relevant EU rules, such review must be carried out to a precise, demonstrable standard, which involves detailed expert examination of product dossiers submitted by applicant companies. As provided for under the relevant legislation, it was agreed that the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, would carry out the detailed examination of the application dossiers and recommend in each case on the grant or otherwise of a licence and the conditions which might be attached to such <Col N="675" /> licence. In other words, the IMB would recommend but I would in each case decide on the grant of a licence and on the conditions which should be attached to such licence.</P>
    <P>It is not the case, as implied by the Deputy's question, that the Irish Medicines Board has recommended that all ruminant vaccines should be reclassified as &ldquo;prescription only&rdquo;. In fact, the essence of the board's recommendations in respect of ruminant vaccines is that they be classified as &ldquo;prescription only exempt&rdquo;. The key difference between the two classifications is that while the former may only be supplied on the prescription of a veterinarian, no such restriction applies in the case of the latter category, which may be sold directly by pharmacists.  </P>
    <P>I should make clear that the position of the Irish Medicines Board, notwithstanding final decisions on the appropriate routes of supply for individual vaccines, rests with me under the relevant legislation. In terms of exercising my statutory function as competent authority, I should stress that I do not have a general policy which would necessarily preclude any of the interests provided for in the 1996 Animal Remedies Regulations from selling vaccines. Rather, each case will be fully evaluated on an objective basis, taking particular account of the criteria governing the designation of routes of supply contained in the 1996 regulations and also having due regard to the recommendation of the IMB in each case. Where, on the basis of this examination, it is concluded that a particular sales category meets all the necessary requirements, that category will be utilised.</P>

      <P>The position is that since 1 January 2001, almost 493,000 cheques with a value in excess of £178 million issued to farmers under the 2000 headage and premium schemes. Since 1 March 2001, some 174,000 cheques valued at more than £56 million have been paid to livestock farmers of which 111,000 payments, totalling £10 million, were paid during the last ten days mainly under euro compensation to beef and sheep producers. In addition, more than 160,000 cheques estimated at £6 million, also under euro compensation, are expected to issue to special beef premium applicants during this month. Euro compensation of almost £5 million has already been paid to REPS participants.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the needs of farmers at this time, which is why the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I recently put arrangements in place to fast-track the processing of applications under the farm assist scheme in respect of farmers who have been affected by the foot and mouth disease problem.</P>
      <P>In so far as payment of extensification premium is concerned, it is presumed that the Deputy is referring to premium in respect of the year 2000 rather than 2001. Under the protocol on direct payments to farmers, my Department is committed to paying the 2000 extensification premium in June 2001 and to having payments in all eligible cases completed by 30 June 2001, in line with EU rules. However, in view of the current difficulties being experienced by farmers, I have asked my officials to examine prospects for achieving an earlier payment date.</P>

      <P>The position is that, as outlined in my letter of 9 March 2001, the area aid application from the person concerned has been processed. She applied on six cows under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme and the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 31 May 2000. Following a cross-check of the tag numbers applied on against a database of animals slaughtered it was established that animal bearing tag number PFJC0010R was listed as having been slaughtered on 17 May 2000. Further investigations will, therefore, have to be carried out before the applications can be finalised. Unfortunately, because of the present restrictions on farm visits it has not been possible for my Department to complete these investigations. My Department will endeavour to complete all outstanding inquiries as soon as possible and the result will be communicated to the person named.</P>

The schemes of improvement in dairy hygiene standards and installation aid for young farmers which operated under the same programme closed to new applications on 4 October 1996 and 7 August 1997, respectively.

      <P>My Department on 28 December 1998 introduced a national installation aid scheme for young farmers.

      <P>In March, 1992, a set of guidelines, entitled &ldquo;State Bodies Guidelines&rdquo;, was issued by the Department of Finance. These guidelines set out the underlying principles which should govern relationships between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis. The guidelines advise, <i>inter alia</i>, written codes of conduct for directors. The guidelines are non-statutory and are intended to complement statutory requirements in this area.</P>
      <P>The guidelines should be brought to the attention of directors on their appointment. It is a matter for each State body to do so. The guidelines recommend that the chairperson of each State body reports on an annual basis to the relevant Minister on the extent of compliance with the guidelines. Work is almost complete on a revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which will update, clarify and expand the 1992 guidelines. The code sets out the principles of corporate governance which State bodies will be required to adopt</P>
      <P>I intend to seek Government approval for the revised code of practice shortly. On receipt of this approval, the code will be circulated to Government Departments and all State bodies. I also intend to make the revised code available on the website of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, provides for the development by the Government, the relevant Oireachtas Committees and the Minister for Finance, of codes of conduct which will apply to Ministers and office holders, Members of the Oireachtas, employees and directors of public bodies respectively. These codes of conduct will deal with the standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the persons to whom they relate in the performance of their public duties. The codes will form part of the terms and conditions of public service employees and directors, and will provide guidance for them in the performance of their functions. The Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may accept an existing code as meeting the requirements of the Bill. Therefore, a code of conduct for directors that is <Col N="683" /> introduced under the existing State bodies guidelines or the forthcoming code of practice may be so recognised.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a dedicated anti-smuggling team of 26 Customs officers stationed at Dublin Airport, which is specifically responsible for tackling drugs and other smuggling activity. These officers are supported by an additional 15 staff who are primarily responsible for the control and clearance of freight. Similar Customs anti-smuggling teams are deployed throughout the country at all of the main ports and airports. Customs also has a centralised intelligence gathering and management unit which supports all operational antismuggling teams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past three years, the Customs Service was responsible for the seizure of drugs nationally with a street value in excess of £78 million. During the same period, Customs staff at Dublin Air<Col N="684" /> port seized drugs with a street value of almost £7 million while drugs valued in excess of £1 million have already been seized this year. These seizures have been made using a combination of profiling and risk analysis techniques and also through intelligence gathered both locally and through contact with other Customs Services.</P>
    <P>A Government decision of 19 July 1995, assigned primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of drugs intended to be smuggled or imported into the State to the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. The Government decision has been given effect by an agreed Memorandum of Understanding concerning the relationship between the Customs Service and the Garda Síochána in respect of drugs law enforcement which was signed on 12 January 1996 by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner and noted and endorsed by the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Practical arrangements have been agreed between the two agencies in an operation protocol. Where Customs officers detect a person smuggling drugs at Dublin Airport, the gardaí at Santry Garda Station are immediately notified. As the Deputy is aware, I have no responsibility for Garda operations.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners continuously evaluate the effect of all their anti-smuggling programmes and review the resources involved. They are satisfied that the dedicated Customs anti-smuggling team, and the other staff involved, are very effective in tackling drugs smuggling at Dublin Airport.</P>

These include both An Post and the credit unions. It is a matter for any savings manager eligible under the Act to decide whether or not to offer a SSIA product. The NTMA has confirmed to me that it will be making a SSIA product(s) available through An Post. The provision of a SSIA product by the credit unions is a matter for them.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the budget 2001 I abolished probate tax in respect of deaths occurring on or after budget day, 6 December 2000. In the case of probate tax arising on estates where the death occurred before 6 December 2000, the tax is charged at a rate of 2% on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased whether the assets passed under a will or intestacy. Estates with a taxable value of £40,000 or less are exempt from the tax. A total exemption from probate tax is available where property passes to a spouse and where jointly owned property passes automatically from one joint owner to another joint owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a house being left to a family member, there is an exemption in such cases where the beneficiary is a dependent child or dependent relative of the deceased. The house is exempt from probate tax provided the dependent child or relative had been residing in the dwelling house at the death of the deceased and had an income not exceeding the specified amount applicable in the tax year prior to the date of death &ndash; for the tax year 1999-2000 the specified amount is £5,152. To qualify as a dependent child, the child must have been under the age of 18 years, or if over 18 years, in full time education. To qualify as a dependent relative, the person concerned must have been a relative of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased, who was incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or the widowed father <Col N="688" /> or mother, whether or not he or she was so incapacitated, of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased. In addition, there is an existing provision in the legislation for deferral of the tax by the Revenue Commissioners in cases of hardship or where the estate is illiquid. This provision for hardship cases has applied since the introduction of probate tax.</P>

      <P>My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the cardiovascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria in that they are generally available over the counter and may be advertised directly to the public. However, in light of the recommendations that have been made to me I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders only. Evidence shows that the lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. Accordingly, it is considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance in helping it to quit the habit.</P>

I have provided funding for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at St. Columcille's Hospital. This unit is currently being equipped. It is envisaged that the unit will be operational by the end of this month. A consultant orthodontist and one specialist orthodontist have been appointed to this unit and are currently operating out of St. James's Hospital. The East Coast Area Health Board also provides services from a satellite clinic at Ballinteer Health Centre where another specialist is employed. The East Coast Area Health Board is in the process of recruiting administrative and nursing staff and will shortly commence an advertising campaign to attract additional specialists into the orthodontic service.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area, the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable. The National Breast Screening Board is currently examining the proposal for the roll out of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
      <P>My Department from time to time considers changes to the disability related allowances which come under its aegis to ensure that the most appropriate agreed financial supports and allowances are provided to people with disabilities. As an example of such a change, from 1 April 2001, the maximum rate of the mobility allowance has been increased from a £45.60 per month to £90 per month.</P>
      <P>It had been envisaged that from 1 April 2001, persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I gave further consideration to this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals. It has now been decided that while the increased rate of up to a maximum of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax concessions, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of up to a maximum of £45.60 per month.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the disability related allowances which come under its aegis and are administered by the health boards, including mobility allowance.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide a range of health related services to people within the community and when appropriate, within their own home. Such services are generally provided to individuals with disabilities and their families, older people and individuals who have just been discharged from hospital who require follow up services within their own home.</P>
      <P>Priorities for development for physical and sensory disability services and intellectual disability services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for both sectors. Between 1999 and 2001 a total of £107.25 million additional ongoing revenue has been allocated for the development of health related support services, including services, which are provided in the home for people with disabilities. As requested, the allocation of this funding is broken down in the following table, by health board, for each of the three years in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1999, a total of £11.35 million has been allocated to the health boards for the development of home help/community support services for older people. Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the role played by home helps is vital to the success of this policy. Following the publication of the report entitled &ldquo;The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland&rdquo; by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, a total of £4.28 million has been provided to the health <Col N="695" /> boards between 1999 and 2001 to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training for home helps as recommended in the report. In addition, £7.07 million <Col N="696" /> has been allocated for the development of community support services for older people. Details of the breakdown of this funding are provided in the table following:</P>

      <P>As I have previously advised the Deputy on a number of occasions, the expert review group has indicated that it anticipates that its work will be completed in a number of months. Because of the importance and the complexity of the work it is not possible to give an exact date for completion but I have been assured that the group is working as expeditiously as possible and that there is no undue delay in the work of the group. I am looking forward to receiving the report which I will consider in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 184 and 196 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to extend automatic medical card eligibility to those in the age group 70 and over was announced in the budget last December. It was also then stated that the measure would be <Col N="699" /> introduced from July of this year. The choice of that date was to allow for the timely, agreed and effective implementation of the initiative and in particular to ensure that the application processes for those benefiting could be as smooth and simplified as possible.</P>
    <P>In that context, all health boards are currently examining their organisational processes, including staffing and other resources matters, to ensure readiness. In addition, the Department is proposing to embark on a public informational campaign at the end of April to promote awareness of the budget initiative. It is considered that a campaign at that time will have the greatest impact. That campaign will be carried out in conjunction with the health boards and will involve media coverage, press releases, advertising features and even Internet promotion. The relevant section in my Department will continue to give the fullest information available to any person making an inquiry on this subject either now or in the future.</P>
    <P>On the matter of discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, I met with the IMO at the beginning of March to discuss a range of issues relevant to the operation and development of general practice, including the introduction of automatic medical card eligibility for all persons aged 70 and over. I found the discussion useful and informative.</P>
    <P>More recently, agreement on a number of specific matters has been secured with the IMO at the Health Service Employers' Agency including a commitment from them to enter discussions on the medical card issue after Easter with a view to ensuring agreed implementation by the due date of 1 July.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all of the above, it would be most disappointing and regrettable if any general practitioner was to be unhelpful in assisting any eligible patients to benefit from this initiative. Indeed, the positive role that such doctors can play in making the application process as smooth as possible will be one of the matters to be discussed with the IMO.</P>

    <P>Overall hospital waiting list figures have gone down by almost a quarter since December 1999 and it is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in County Kerry is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran Report <i>Review of Orthodontic Services</i> structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists, the commissioning of four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and North Cork and the validation of waiting lists. These proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce waiting times to under 12 months in the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the chief executive of the SHB that there are currently 9,500 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment. However, the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in County Kerry is not available as information relating to orthodontic waiting lists is not maintained on a geographical basis by the board.</P>

      <P>The State Enrolled Nurse (SEN) qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised here. Persons who have obtained that qualification must undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom to qualify for registration as a nurse. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide such a programme here because the rules of the UK regulatory authority for nursing only allow for not more than 10% of the clinical component of the programme taking place outside of its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>However, under a recent initiative taken by me, any State Enrolled Nurse working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom will now qualify for a non-means tested grant of IR£6,000. The grant will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the SEN to work as a nurse in the Irish health service following completion of the programme and registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>There are several hundred SENs working in our health service who are making an important contribution to patient care across a range of settings. My initiative provides them with a financial incentive to upgrade to the level of registered nurses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973 and is administered by health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of eligible children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. The current rate of payment is £129.40 per month, effective from 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the following change to the DCA scheme was announced in the budget on 6 December 2000 and came into effect from 1 April 2001: The introduction of a pro-rata DCA payment in respect of periods spent at home, weekends and holidays, by eligible children who normally reside in special schools or institutions; prior to 1 April 2001, DCA was not available in respect of children who resided in special schools or institutions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's questions relating to the percentage of children in special schools in respect of whom DCA is paid, I have been advised that the health boards do not collate DCA statistics in this format. As DCA is paid in respect of the additional care and supervision given at home, the data collected by the health boards does not indicate what number of DCA recipients are attending special schools. However, I have included the following data relating to the number of DCA recipients on 31 December 2000, the most recent period for which information is available, for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the South-Eastern Health Board: Eastern Regional Health Authority, 3,365; South-Eastern Health Board, 1,150.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Diethylstilboestrol, DES, was one of the first synthetic non-steroidal oestrogenic compounds that was developed in 1938. One of the uses of these oestrogenic compounds was in pregnancy to prevent miscarriages and premature births, particularly in those pregnancies that were complicated by diabetes or toxaemia.</P>
      <P>Medical preparations containing diethylstilbestrol were available in this country during the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. There is no relevant information available on the level of prescribing or use of diethylstilbestrol during these years. In 1972 and again in 1975, the National Drugs Advisory Board reviewed the position and drew attention to the problems associated with the use of oestrogens and with stilboestrol and recommended that high doses of stilboestrol should not be used during pregnancy.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the following medicinal products were authorised by the Minister for Health on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board for purposes other than use in the course of pregnancy: Boestrol tablets, for the treatment of malignancy and atrophic vaginitis, and Tampovagan Stilboestrol and Lactic Acid Pessaries, for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, senile or post menopausal disorders. This product was discontinued in 1992 for commercial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both products were contraindicated in the case of pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or in patients <Col N="706" /> who may become pregnant. Concern in this country in relation to DES has mainly centred on the lack of awareness among the medical profession as to the benign nature of DES related vaginal adenosis and the danger of unnecessary surgical intervention. The view taken was that the most appropriate way to deal with this matter was to ensure that all the information available was channelled through the medical profession with assistance from the Department of Health and Children as required. A leaflet on DES was prepared in 1991 by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, in consultation with the Health Promotion Unit of the Department and distributed to the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women met with the Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1990 to discuss the matter. Essentially, the council wished to make contact with the daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy in the 1940s. 1950s and 1960s and to alert them to the possibility of their having contracted vaginal adenosis and to advise them of the relevant treatment for this condition. A special unit was set up in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2, in 1990, to assess and deal with the matter. My Department has been advised by the unit that of the 360 women who were seen at the unit, approximately, one-third of the women, 120, are deemed to have been exposed to the drug. The majority of these had been exposed to the drug in the 1960s, with only a few after 1972. The remainder of the women who attended the unit were anxious to have their anxieties that they may have been exposed to the drug allayed.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Minister for Health, on the invitation of DES Action Ireland launched the European DES Awareness Week. From information to hand it appears that appropriate advice was channelled through the relevant medical personnel with a view to ensuring that women affected by DES would receive appropriate and speedy medical care.</P>
    <P>I would advise persons who have concerns that they may have been exposed to DES to contact the special unit in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2. There are no proposals in relation to compensation under consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>The provision of treatment for drug misuse is a matter for health boards in the first instance. Each health board has in place co-ordinating arrangements with other agencies and organisations to ensure that in relation to treatment services, emerging needs are identified and responded to. My Department consults with health boards on a regular basis in relation to the provision of treatment services. On the basis of such consultations health boards are funded on an annual basis to put services in place to respond to such emerging needs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in areas where the drug problem is most acute, local drugs task forces have been established to provide a co-ordinated and integrated response. Health boards are represented on these task forces and, in addition, the National Drugs Strategy Team to whom the task forces report is chaired by an official of my Department. This ensures that, in its dealings with the health boards, my Department is fully informed about service needs in particular areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the cost of the accommodation provided by the East Coast Area Health Board for the 54 Filipino nurses is £120.00 per week per nurse. No payment has been made to date. There was no discrimination by management of the accommodation in serving breakfast to the Filipino nurses. Meals were supplied at times both early and late to accommodate nurses on different shift rosters. The accommodation at another property was only arranged as an interim measure for the St. Patrick's weekend. The original guesthouse was again available from Tuesday, 20 March, immediately following the bank holiday weekend. The accommodation was accepted by the liaison officer as an emergency interim measure. According to the East Coast Area Health Board, the nurses were reluctant to return to the original accommodation as the <Col N="708" /> accommodation sourced at their final work placement was almost ready.</P>
      <P>The East Coast Area Health Board feels that it was unfortunate that the nurses were in such accommodation even on an interim basis. Unfortunately the liaison officer had become ill in the meantime and this contributed to an undue delay in moving the nurses to more appropriate accommodation. The three area health boards moved immediately, when they became aware of the problem, to rectify matters and apologised to the nurses concerned. In recognition of the fact that the sourcing of nurses and other health and social services personnel from abroad will be a necessary feature of the recruitment policy of the area health boards in the eastern region, the following additional specialist support is being provided by them &ndash; a designated person responsible for sourcing and vetting accommodation and a second designated person for dealing with all other matters to facilitate the seamless integration of these valued members of staff.</P>
      <P>The boards regret that this matter caused concern to the nurses and the public generally and have taken positive steps to prevent a recurrence in the future. The ERHA has networked with directors of nursing in the region and has been assured that every effort is being made to make the nurses feel welcome in this country.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my reply last Wednesday, 4 April, to a number of questions about this particular case, my Department has written to health service employers reminding them of their responsibilities towards nurses recruited from abroad. My Department is also establishing a working group to prepare guidelines on best practice in the recruitment of nurses from abroad.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, approved the establishment of a project team in May, 1999 to commence the planning of phase 2B development at Longford Westmeath General Hospital. In keeping with normal practice in major capital developments of this kind, the project team was asked to prepare a written design brief for the development of phase 2B to include the following departments: pathology; theatres; general medicine; general surgery; day surgery; administration services; isolation facilities; staff changing rooms; staff rest rooms; acute psychiatric unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brief was received in the Department on 16 November, 2000. In a letter from the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board, which accompanied the brief, he indicated that the project team was anxious that intensive care and coronary care be included in phase 2B and that the budget allocated for this purpose should enable these departments to proceed. The chief executive officer also expressed the view of the project team that, in the event of additional <Col N="710" /> national development plan funding or other capital funding being made available, the outstanding departments not already included in phase 2B should proceed as part of the phase 2B contract. These include: rehabilitation unit; child and adolescent psychiatry; occupational therapy; catering department; day services (other than surgical); ICU/CCU.</P>
    <P>A further letter of 10 January, 2001 from the secretary of the Midland Health Board to my Department indicated that board members had unanimously adopted a motion calling on me to give a firm commitment on the inclusion of the ICU, CCU, rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy department, catering department and day services in phase 2B of the Longford Westmeath development.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Adjournment debate on 22 February this year my colleague, Deputy Hanafin, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, indicated that the additional accommodation is a substantial additional cost on the phase 2B proposal for which the project team was appointed.</P>

      <P>There are a number of activities taking place at European level in relation to combating the problem of misuse of drugs. EU member states have adopted a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs 2000-2004. The plan outlines the need for a balanced approach between demand and supply reduction. The plan emphasises the need to evaluate experience and identify best practice to ensure continuity and consistency in order to build upon the previous action plan. It identifies many new challenges and reaffirms the EU's commitment to the relevant UN conventions. Its main aims include ensuring that the issue of drug misuse is kept as a major priority and to continue an EU integrated and balanced approach to the fight against drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are some of the key features of the EU action plan: it provides for the Commission to organise appropriate evaluations at mid-term and on completion of the EU Drugs Strategy 2000-08. Each member state will have to account for the actions they have taken in accordance with the relevant sections of the action plan. Current priorities are co-ordination, information, synthetic drugs, training, risk to young people from drug taking in sport, illicit drug trafficking, and international co-operation. Priority will also be given to progressing a number of action points in the plan; including in the EU annual report on <Col N="711" /> drugs an overview of measures taken as follow up to the action plan; completion of work on the five key epidemiological indicators and the development of indicators on drugs related crime, the availability of illicit drugs and drug related social exclusion; launch of a study of attitudes to drugs throughout the EU; establishment of measurable targets so that assessments can be made on progress in achieving objectives in the action plan; and evaluation of the co-ordination arrangements that are in place.</P>
    <P>Linking in with the above is the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The EMCDDA was set up to provide the European Community and its member states with objective, reliable and comparable information at European level concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences. The statistical, documentary and technical information processed or produced by the centre helps provide an overall picture of the drug phenomenon in Europe. Its main tasks are collecting and analysing existing information on drugs, improving data-comparison methods, disseminating information, and co-operating with European and international bodies and organisations, and with non-EU countries. The centre's work focuses on several aspects of the drugs problem &ndash; demand and reduction of the demand for drugs, national and Community strategies and policies, international co-operation and the geopolitics of supply, control of the trade in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors; and implications of the drugs phenomenon for producer, consumer and transit countries.</P>
    <P>The EMCDDA co-ordinates a network of 15 national focal points, one in each member state. The drugs misuse research division of the Health Research Board is the focal point for Ireland. The focal points link European Union institutions, central and eastern European countries, international organisations, specialised national centres and drug information networks. In preparation for the centre's annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union, the national focal points gather data each year from drug monitoring units in their own countries as well as from selected specialised governmental and non-governmental bodies.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland currently holds the chair of the Pompidou group of the Council of Europe. The Pompidou group provides a forum for exchanging views and co-ordinating action in Europe in response to the growing drugs problem for countries in the European Union and central and eastern European countries.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital rests with the North-Eastern Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the board and it informs me that the planning for the capital development programme of the Cavan Monaghan Hospital Group, which includes Monaghan Hospital, has reached a draft brief stage. The board is assessing, from a service perspective, what elements of the plan can be sequenced over the next 3-4 years. Many elements of the project for Monaghan involve the refurbishment and re-equipping of existing buildings and facilities and the board has indicated that these are likely to be a top priority.</P>
      <P>The theatre facility is to be brought on stream shortly with costs for 2001 in the order of £300,000 inclusive of equipment and installation. In addition, the refurbished female medical ward has been brought into service.</P>

      <P>I am committed to a rigorous and far-reaching review of general practice that will shape its future development as a key aspect of the integrated health services of the future. Part of that process is already complete and involved a major examination by the health board chief executive officers of the infrastructural issues and challenges facing general practice. Having received their report, and Government agreement to move forward with the review process, it is now my intention to engage in a wide-ranging consultative exercise with all the relevant representative bodies, in particular, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners. The review process will be especially concerned with addressing comprehensively the issue of general practice in the rural setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are already a number of distinct measures in place to deal with the realities of rural general practice. First, many rural general practitioners in the GMS scheme qualify for a rural practice allowance, and those that qualify for that allowance are also very favourably treated in terms of medical indemnity support. <Col N="713" /> Second, a computerised dispensing doctor system is currently being introduced and that will greatly benefit rural GPs who are dispensing doctors. Third, since 1998, the Department has provided significant financial support to individual rural GPs to improve the position of those in one in one rotas. Fourth, the response being developed in my Department to the out of hours issue generally has specific regard to the rural issue in that all proposals for project support must provide for an equality of service between urban and rural areas.</P>

      <Quest>the average number of visits per person per annum by elderly medical card holders to their general practitioner; the annual payment to a general practitioner for the provision of this service; the rate of this payment to general practitioners per medical card holders in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the payment system to general practitioners in respect of medical card holders is an annual capitation payment the matter of the number of visits is not recorded. This annual capitation payment system is based on the age and sex of the patients on a doctor's GMS panel. The total amount payable, therefore, to an individual doctor depends on the number, sex and age of these patients on his panel.</P>
      <P>The annual payments to general practitioners under the GMS scheme for the provision of this service for the last five years are as per the following table:</P>

      <P>I assume from the Deputy's question that she is referring to the grant allocations I made under the urban and village renewal programme 2000-06. This programme forms part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 under the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and west and south and east regions. Following are the details of the allocation I announced on 3 April last.</P>
      <P>The selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded under the new measures will be a matter for the local authorities, having regard to the detailed guidelines for the programme which I have now issued to the various local authorities. Local authorities have been asked to prepare strategic documents-plans under the scheme and these have to be submitted to my Department by 31 May next.</P>

      <P>The administration of the tenant purchase scheme in individual cases is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the relevant regulations and guidelines from my Department. Tenants wishing to buy their local authority house are provided, by the local authority, with a valuation and a sale price, which takes into account the relevant discounts. These terms stand for a maximum period of one year, during which time tenants who wish to purchase must agree in writing to proceed with the purchase. I consider this maximum one year period adequate to enable the tenant to make a decision on whether or not to purchase and I have no proposals to change it. However, in circumstances where a tenant has agreed in writing to proceed with the purchase on the basis of a sale price supplied by the local authority, but the process is delayed due to legal or other difficulties arising on the part of the authority, I consider that, in equity, this sale price should remain valid until the authority is in a position to complete the sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced upgraded building regulations and related technical guidance in 1997 requiring that all new houses commencing on or after 1 July, 1998 incorporate radon protection measures. Technical guidance document C &ndash; site preparation and resistance to moisture (1997 edition) gives guidance on protecting against radon in new dwellings and other long stay residential buildings and draws attention to the results of a national survey of radon in houses carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The institute has published a map incorporating the survey results.</P>
      <P>Technical guidance document C provides that all new houses in high radon areas should incorporate a radon proof membrane and a sump at foundation level. All other houses should incorporate a passive sump that can be activated post construction, if a radon survey warrants activation. Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in technical guidance document C, this will, <i>prima facie</i>, indicate compliance with the building regulations. I am advised that the guidance on radon protection measures is adequate and has been welcomed by the RPII.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the building regulations is primarily the responsibility of designers, builders and owners of the new houses involved. The monitoring and enforcement of the regulations is a function of the local building control authorities.</P>

      <P>EU Directive 91/439/EEC on driver licensing harmonises standards for driver testing by national authorities and requires that persons must undergo a driving test before obtaining a full driving licence. Within this framework, there is mutual recognition of national driving licences within the European Economic Area. It would not be compatible with these arrangements for full driving licences to be granted without the passing of a practical test and, accordingly, Irish national regulations do not provide for this.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, Westmeath County Council has sought to implement interim solutions, the first of which involved the augmentation of the supply to Moate from a groundwater source at Knockdomney. This was commissioned late last year under the small schemes programme. A report on further possible interim sources was received by my Department from the council this week. The report is being examined and a response will issue to the council as soon as possible.</P>

On foot of this, proposals were received from Cork, Fingal, Louth, Meath, South Dublin, Westmeath and Wicklow county councils and Dublin and Waterford corporations seeking the designation of a total 25 sites as strategic development zones. Six of the 25 sites proposed were from Westmeath County Council which proposed three sites in Mullingar and a further three in Athlone. I propose to include with my reply a tabular report setting out details of the sites submitted.</P>
      <P>Following an evaluation of the 25 sites submitted, I approved 11 sites for further consideration in October last including the sites in the townland of Pettitswood-Ballinderry in Mullingar. Additional information sought from the local authorities at that time was subsequently provided and a detailed evaluation of the shortlisted sites is being finalised.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation, refunds of motor tax can, subject to certain conditions, be made in circumstances where: a vehicle has been scrapped-destroyed or sent permanently out of the State; a vehicle has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner; a vehicle in respect of which a tax disc has been taken out has not been used in a public place at any time since the issue of the disc; the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of illness, injury or other physical disability to use the vehicle; the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of the absence from the State for business or educational purposes, to use the vehicle; or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of service overseas with the Defence Forces, to use the vehicle.</P>
      <P>In addition, the law provides that payment of motor tax is only due from the date of use in a public place. Accordingly, if a person's motor tax expired, for example, in January 2001 and the vehicle was not used in a public place in the period between January and this month, liability for motor tax only arises with effect from this month. Existing legislation does not provide for suspension of motor tax in other circumstances and I have no plans at present to bring forward proposals to alter this position.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive package of measures to increase the protection of our architectural heritage was introduced in 1998. Among other things, these measures provided for increased powers to local authorities to secure the conservation and protection of protected structures and imposed a duty of care on the owner and occupier of a protected structure.</P>
      <P>To support these measures, my Department introduced a conservation grant scheme for protected structures, which is operated by local authorities. The scheme assists the owner or occupier of a protected structure to undertake necessary works to secure the conservation of a structure or part of the structure. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of the works up to a maximum of £10,000. The local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards or, in exceptional circumstances, upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved works or £20,000, whichever is the lesser. A total of £4.482 million is available for this scheme in 2001. I expect to announce details of this year's allocation shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-06 include a sub-measure under which assistance is provided for the conservation of the architectural heritage. Grants will be paid by my <Col N="725" /> Department under this sub-measure to local authorities, civic trusts, etc. to upgrade buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit. A total of £864,818 was allocated under this measure in 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department issues over half a million cheques every month and is not aware of any systematic problems regarding the encashment of cheques by social welfare recipients. Cheques are but one of a range of payment methods offered by my Department. Approximately, 10% of clients receive payment by cheque at present.</P>
      <P>Recently, some banks introduced a policy whereby cheques must be lodged and cleared before value is given to the customer. With the exception of a small number of payable orders which are drawn on the Paymaster General, cheques issued by my Department are drawn on the Bank of Ireland which has given an assurance that the recent changes in its cheque encashment policy will not affect social welfare cheques. This arrangement is, of course, subject to the banks being satisfied regarding the identity and bona fides of the customer.</P>
      <P>While the exact figures are not available, it is estimated that the majority of social welfare recipients cash their cheques at retail outlets and, as such, any change in bank practice does not impact upon them. If the Deputy is aware of any individuals who have experienced difficulties in cashing their cheques, perhaps he would provide me with the relevant details and I will arrange to have the matter examined further.</P>

      <P>To date, income deriving from participation in the home-help service has not in general been taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to means-tested social welfare payments. The basis for disregarding home help income originates in the fact that the service was traditionally a community-based good neighbours scheme attracting volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service and, as such, the service did not come within the realm of conventional employment.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of Labour Court negotiations last June, agreement was reached on a revised overall pay structure for home helps in return for a restructured and enhanced home help service. The agreement provided for the alignment of hourly home help pay-rates with the pay-rates of other non-nursing health service employees, the payment of travel expenses, premia payments for Saturday-Sunday working and full annual leave entitlement as set out in the Part-time Workers Agreement in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised pay-rates were awarded on a phased basis of 75% from 1 January 2000, 85% from 1 July 2000 and the full rate from 1 January 2001. Accordingly, home helps now have full employee status similar to all other health service employees. In the circumstances, the current <Col N="728" /> arrangements for home helps are being reviewed. The Department of Finance emphasise that during all stages of the negotiations &ndash; including the Labour Court &ndash; it was made absolutely clear that any concessions, currently enjoyed by home helps, in the area of income tax and-or social welfare, would cease should the unions succeed in their pay claim.</P>

      <P>Expenditure under the SWA scheme over the last three years is set out in the following tabular statement. As can be seen from the table the most notable increase in expenditure over the last three years has been on basic payments and this amounted to almost 74%. The major factor in the increase in basic payment expenditure over this period has been the increasing number of asylum seekers whose needs were met through the SWA scheme prior to the introduction of the system of direct provision in April last year. A significant increase was also recorded for rent supplement expenditure due mainly to the increasing costs of private rented accommodation.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding whether SWA is payable in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The person concerned had been in receipt a rent supplement of £40.50 per week up to October 1999. The individual then moved to new accommodation and applied for a rent supplement. The application was refused by the community welfare officer as the rent of £100 per week was in excess of the Eastern Health Board limit which at the time was £60 per week for a single person.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these limits is to ensure the property being rented is not excessively expensive having regard to the person's reasonable needs. A health board will not assist a person with rent supplement where payment of the supplement would lead to the person being left with income below the SWA rate appropriate to his or her circumstances. A letter issued from the health board in October 1999 to the person concerned explaining why the application had been refused and advising the applicant to secure more reasonably priced appropriate accommodation which would allow the CWO to assist with the rental cost by way of a rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not contacted the health board again regarding an application for a rent supplement since this letter issued.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide a means tested income support payment to those who are caring full time and who are on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing regulations social security payments made by other jurisdictions are treated in <Col N="730" /> a manner similar to their Irish equivalents and are taken into account when determining means for carer's allowance purposes. Where a carer is in receipt of a social security payment from another country, this payment is assessable as means. If the carer is married-cohabiting, the assessment is halved. Where the spouse-partner of the carer is in receipt of social security payment from another jurisdiction an amount equivalent to the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension, currently £106.00 per week, is disregarded and half of the balance is assessable as means.</P>
    <P>The general principle of not paying more than one social welfare payment to an individual is a fundamental element of the social welfare system and the present arrangements arise from that principle. Any change in the existing rules in this regard would have expenditure implications and could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements have been made to enable carers to undertake employment of up to ten hours per week and still qualify for carer's allowance. In such cases income of up to £125 per week can be disregarded in the assessment of means for carer's allowance purposes.</P>

      <P>In calculating means for the purpose of farm assist, account is taken of the gross yearly income which the farmer and his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive from farming or any other self-employment, less any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on the business. Where the farmer has dependent children, £200.00 per annum is disregarded in respect of each of the first two qualified children and £300.00 each per annum for subsequent children. Some 70% of the remaining net income is then assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment is designed to form a basis on which entitlement to farm assist can be determined. This means that the assessment of the expected annual income is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. However, where changes in circumstances are likely to affect current business, every effort is made to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects likely income and expenditure in the current year of operation. Where a farmer disagrees with a means assessment, he or she may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals office. In addition, where a farmer feels that his or her circumstances have <Col N="731" /> changed since the most recent assessment, he or she may request a means review.</P>
    <P>Income from both the rural environmental protection scheme and the special areas of conservation scheme is assessed separately from other farm income and is calculated as follows: the first £2,000 is disregarded; expenses necessarily incurred are deducted; and 50% of the balance is assessed.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints and as such the cost of relaxing the current arrangements is not available. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, in April last year. The review notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appoint<Col N="732" /> ments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children bringing this recommendation to their attention.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a range of grants schemes and programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. Grants are not available from my Department towards services that are deemed the responsibility of other Departments or statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations operated by my Department provides once-off grants to voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas, towards renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications, research or other special projects. The types of groups eligible for funding under this scheme are community development and area development organisations, family support groups, welfare rights and information groups, mutual support and self-help organisations and co-ordinating and umbrella organisations.</P>
      <P>All groups seeking funding under this and other grants schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department takes account of the extent to which each group, and the project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that the mid western regional office of my Department received an application for funding from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. As a large number of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to the group under this year's <Col N="733" /> schemes. However, my Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding their application.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a carer's allowance on 20 September 2000, in respect of both her parents. Carer's allowance was awarded with effect from 21 September 2000 at the maximum weekly personal rate of £80.50, in respect of her father.</P>
      <P>Regarding the application for her mother, medical evidence was considered by the Department's chief medical adviser. Having examined all the evidence provided, he expressed the opinion that the care recipient was not so disabled as to require full time care and attention. This application was accordingly refused. She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal on 12 February 2001. To date no appeal has been lodged.</P>

      <P>There is already a system of income maintenance supports for people on low incomes who have difficulties in meeting their housing costs. Rent and mortgage interest supplements paid as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are designed for that purpose. These supplements are normally calculated to ensure the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. There is also provision in the SWA scheme which allows health boards to assist people with rent deposits by way of an exceptional needs payment. SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their housing supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Income maintenance payments deal with the symptoms of the problem but it is also necessary to deal with the underlying imbalances in the overall housing system. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure a full range of housing options is made available to people with long-term housing needs, many of whom currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The Government has also taken a number of other initiatives to improve the supply of social and affordable housing in response to the current housing situation. This is the best approach to meeting the housing needs of people on low incomes.</P>

      <P>In budget 2001, I announced increases of between £8 and £12.90 per week in the personal rates of various social welfare payments for widowed persons. Widows and widowers under 66 years of age received the general increase of £8 per week granted to most social welfare recipients. With effect from this month, the maximum rate of widow(er)'s contributory pension is £89.10 per week for a person under 66 years of age. The equivalent rate for the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension and the one-parent family payment is £85.50. In addition those widow/ers with children receive increases of £17 and £15.20, respectively, for each child.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, I also provided for the rate of child benefit to increase by £25 per month for each of the first and second children and £30 per month for third and subsequent children. This will bring monthly child benefits to £67.50 and £86 per month, respectively. These increases will come into effect in June 2000 and will be of major benefit to widowed people with dependent children. The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in the context of overall budgetary considerations.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commenced its work in December 2000.

This group is examining the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments as well as the issue of relative income poverty and I look forward to receiving the report of the group in due course.</P>

      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare benefit following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came into office, I have introduced a number of important changes to improve these arrangements. These include an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 in 1999; the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent <Col N="736" /> children who qualify for a widow's/widower's contributory pension, one parent family payment or a bereavement grant in budget 2000 and a number of additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to address the position where the six weeks after death payment was not made or was paid at a reduced amount.</P>
    <P>In cases where the deceased spouse was in receipt of an invalidity pension with an allowance payable in respect of their spouse, the survivor is entitled to six weeks payment of the deceased person's payment at the married rate. No additional payment is made in cases where the deceased spouse was in receipt of an invalidity pension and the survivor was in receipt of any social welfare payment except old age non-contributory pension, blind person's pension or carer's allowance in his/her own right. Neither is a payment made in cases where both spouses were each in receipt of an invalidity pension in their own right. However, the survivor would be entitled to a bereavement grant of £500 and if they had dependent children, they would also be entitled to a widowed parent's grant of £1,000. These arrangements will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. Continuing entitlement under the disability allowance scheme is dependent on the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria. This is achieved through a process of selective and periodic review of appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>There were 55,221 persons in receipt of disability allowance as of 31 March 2001. During the period April 1997 to April 2001, 34,500 recipients who were formerly in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance were medically reviewed. Of these, 46 recipients have had their allowance terminated on the grounds that they no longer satisfied the medical criteria for receipt of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, means reviews were undertaken in the same period in respect of 4,000 former disabled person's maintenance allowance cases. Entitlement was terminated in 442 cases because their means had changed and exceeded the statutory limit. Some 472 had their disability allowance reduced because of changes in their means. In all cases, the persons concerned were informed of the decision and the reasons for it. They were <Col N="737" /> advised of their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The old age non-contributory pension is a social assistance scheme which is designed to provide financial support for older people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes the OANCP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The operation of the means test is kept under review and changes are made as required.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, a new method of capital assessment for most means-tested schemes, including OANCP, came into operation. Under the new method the first £10,000 of capital is disregarded, capital between £10,000 and £20,000 is assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, capital between £20,000 and £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital and capital above £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. The new system is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support. These limits are doubled in the case of a married couple. Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>In the Review of our Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to caring for our older people by committing itself to increasing the old age non-contributory pension to £100 per week by 2002. We are well on the way to achieving this target with very significant increases granted over the last four budgets. In budget 2001, further significant progress was made towards achieving this goal following significant increases in social welfare pension rates. With effect from 6 April 2001, the personal rate of old age non-contributory pension was increased to £95.50 per week. This represents an overall increase of £28 per week for this scheme since this Government took office. These measures reflect the emphasis I have placed on improving the personal pension rates of our older people which I believe is the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved.</P>

      <P>Historically, most public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover. This arose as it was viewed that such employees had provision within the terms and conditions of their public sector employment's for adequate cover for contingencies such as sickness or old age and that the risk of unemployment was not a factor in their case. While there are no plans at present to give those who paid only the modified rate of social insurance access to the old age contributory pension scheme, in recent years a number of measures have been introduced which is making it easier for those with mixed insurance records to receive a payment.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements were introduced for old age contributory and retirement pension purposes in 1991 to cater for people with a mixture of full and modified rate PRSI. The revised arrangements provide for the payment of pro-rata pensions in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the class A rate. In 1997 the yearly average required for a minimum pension was reduced to ten contributions. More recently, I introduced a special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to benefit people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. I understand that former public servants are one of the main groups benefiting from these measures. The old age non-contributory pension is available to those who do not qualify for a contributory pension but who can satisfy a means test.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 246 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must satisfy a number of basic conditions as follows: (1) enter social insurance before age 56 for the old age contributory pen<Col N="739" /> sion and age 55 for the retirement pension; (2) have a minimum of 156 full rate contributions paid &ndash; 260 if the yearly average is less than 20. This requirement will, for all contributors, increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively, and (3) have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a full rate pension.</P>
    <P>In general, all contributions paid or credited, at the appropriate rate, on a person's record are assessed when their entitlement to a pension is being examined. However, only contributions made under the unified social insurance scheme introduced in 1953 can be used to satisfy the average contributions test. Contributions paid prior to 1953 may only be used to satisfy the first two conditions outlined above.</P>
    <P>The question of allowing pre-1953 insurance to be used for the average contributions test was examined in the first phase of the Review of the Qualifying Conditions for the Old Age (Contributory) and Retirement Pensions which I published in August 2000. Generally speaking, the review did not favour affording full recognition to these contributions because such contributions are different in nature to contributions made under the unified system.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans to allow pre-1953 contributions to be taken into account for the yearly average test, nevertheless, further recognition was afforded these contributions in budget 2000 with the introduction from May 2000 of a special half rate pension aimed at people with pre-1953 insurance who cannot satisfy the yearly average test.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify a total of 260 contributions comprising a mixture of pre and post 1953 is required. At this stage in excess of 10,000 pensioners are receiving this special pension. This is just one of the measures introduced in recent years to honour the Government's commitment to ensure the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions. Other measures taken include a reduction in the average number of contributions required for pension purposes to ten, introduced in 1997, and the provision of special pensions for self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory was introduced for this group.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions commenced in February and, among other things, this is considering the implications of a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid/credited over a person's working life. This represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public. <Col N="740" /> However, much work needs to be done before such a system could be introduced. In particular, the cost, operational arrangements and in specific the appropriate level of contributions required for pension entitlement need to be determined. These and other issues are being examined in the context of the second phase of this review which I expect to review later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with Austria, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Quebec on 1 October 1994. All of these agreements have been put into operation.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have acquired these rights while working in Ireland and the other countries to which the agreements apply. Similar protection of pension and other social security rights is afforded workers who have worked in Ireland and the other 14 EU member states by the EU regulations on social security. These also apply to the member states of the European Economic Area &ndash; Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Their application is also likely to be extended to other European countries in the coming years in the context of the enlargement of the EU or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration will continue to be given to concluding further bilateral agreements with individual countries where this is considered warranted by the number of persons who have been working in Ireland and the other country and where there is no immediate prospect of that country coming within the scope of comparable EU arrangements. In line with this policy, preliminary negotiations on a bilateral social security agreement <Col N="741" /> have commenced with the authorities of the Republic of Korea and a draft text furnished by the Korean authorities has been examined by my Department. Preliminary discussions have also taken place with the Czech Republic.</P>
    <P>A review of bilateral agreements is currently under way. In accordance with the provisions of the agreement, a review of the New Zealand agreement is currently at an advanced stage. Similar reviews are due to get under way with the United States and Australia. The monitoring of the application of EU regulations is carried out through the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers. The Department is currently working on updating the guidance notes to assist in the speeding up of the decision making process on claims. This has already been completed with regard to pension provisions of the EU regulations and is due for completion in other areas by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As part of this overall process, there are ongoing detailed discussions on the effective implementation of EU regulations and other bilateral agreements. Any occasional difficulties we may encounter with other states on the implementation of regulations or bilateral agreements are dealt with on a case by case basis with the relevant administration. While any hardship or concern suffered by applicants because of the implementation of regulations or bilateral agreements is to be regretted, it should be remembered that this is necessarily a very cumbersome process given the very different social security arrangements of different countries. It is hoped that the reviews mentioned above will ensure that this is kept to a minimum. If the Deputy knows of any particular case of unusual delay suffered by a claimant, I would be glad to receive details of such cases and will ensure that my Department will take all possible steps in expediting the matter.</P>

      <P>Tá an t-eolas a d'iarr an Teachta maidir le comhairleoirí atá fostaithe ag mo Roinn agus ag na Forais Chultúir Náisiúnta faoi rialú díreach mo Roinne ó Mheitheamh 1997 leagtha amach sa tábla thíos. Ar chúiseanna íogaireachta tráchtála agus rúndachta níl rátaí leathúla ann i dtaca le comhaontuithe comhairleoireachta ar leithligh.</P>
      <P>A mhéid a bhaineann le fógraíocht a dhéanamh le haghaidh tairiscintí, comhlíonann mo Roinn Tairseacha Fógraíochta an AE agus, faoi bhun na dtairseach sin, oibríonn sí polasaí ginearálta tairisceana comórtasaí. I gcásanna inar gá oilteacht nó scileanna ar leith déantar próiseas tairisceana roghnaí a oibriú seachas fógraíocht a dhéanamh le haghaidh tairiscintí. Tá sonraí faoi thionscadail ar leithligh san áireamh sa Tábla leanaigh:</P>

    <P>The Deputy might note that details of the proposed works to which he refers, have not been sub<Col N="758" /> mitted with a view to receiving such consent. In the event of consent being refused, the person concerned should send details of actual losses incurred to my Department, who will assess the claim and make an offer, if it is considered warranted. In the event of disagreement, the regulations provide for arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might also be aware that this person has made an application, which has been referred to the SAC Appeals Advisory Board, to have this land excluded from the SAC. In these circumstances, it is premature to consider any entitlement to compensation at this time.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>if all roads repaired under the Scéim na mBóithre Áise must be the subject of a tender process; and the exact guidelines in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should point out that my Department normally requests the relevant local authorities to provide costing details in respect of roads which are being considered for funding under Scéim na mBóithre Áise &ndash; accommodation roads scheme &ndash; in any given year. Based on the proposals received, funding is allocated to the relevant local authorities to carry out the works on the roads which have been approved. As the improvement works are carried out by local authorities themselves using direct labour the question of tendering does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions 191 and 192, 4 April 2001, my Department has, in recent years, adopted a new approach in relation to the funding of the improvement of bog roads under Scéim na mBóithre Áise &ndash; accommodation roads scheme. Under the revised approach funding is normally provided to a local co-operative or local committee to carry out the works, either by way of a FÁS community <Col N="760" /> employment scheme or alternatively by the employment of a registered contractor. Under the revised approach, grant aid up to £7,000 per mile can be approved in respect of the costs of materials and machinery where the work is being carried out by way of a FÁS community employment scheme and grant aid of up to £10,000 per mile can be approved where the work is being carried out by a registered contractor. It is a matter for the local co-operative or committee in question to obtain tenders, if necessary, and comply with all the other conditions of the scheme including the carrying out of the work.</P>

      <QRef>[10507/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following table indicates the amounts sanctioned for each road in Mayo under Scéim na mBóithre Áise since 1997. As the Deputy is aware, no funding was provided for this scheme in 1996. I have also included a table showing the amounts sanctioned for the improvement of strategic Gaeltacht roads in Mayo for the years 1999 and 2000. All roads listed in the following tables have been completed.</P>
      <P>With the exception of one bog road sanctioned in 2000 and indicated by an asterisk, funding for the improvement of all other roads listed was provided to Mayo County Council to enable it to carry out the works on behalf of my Department. Consequently, the question of departmental invitation of tenders did not arise.</P>
      <P>Regarding the bog road referred to, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 254 of today which outlines the approach which has been adopted in recent years by my Department in relation to the funding of bog roads under Scéim na mBóithre Áise.</P>
      <P>In regard to an English version of the following lists, I must point out that only an Irish version of these lists is currently available. The preparation of English language translations of these lists would take a considerable amount of time. If, however, the Deputy wishes to pursue his request, my Department will endeavour to forward translations to him in due course as pressure of other works permits.</P>

      <P>The designation of the lands in question as part of a special area of conservation, SAC, has been referred to the SAC appeals advisory board. In making its recommendation on the appeal the board will consider all relevant scientific information which may include reports prepared since the proposal to designate the lands, such as the report referred to by the Deputy. I understand that the hearing of the appeal is delayed by the restrictions to prevent spread of foot and mouth disease as experts and the board itself wish to visit the site. I expect the appeal to be progressed promptly once these restrictions are lifted.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the Asgard is lying unsecured and unprotected in the car park at the Point Depot; if she will clarify the time frame for its restoration; the measures the restoration committee will have to put in place to protect the vessel; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The <i>Asgard</i> is owned by the Minister for Defence who agreed to the removal of the vessel from Kilmainham Gaol, where it had been located since 1979, by the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project, ARP. My Department raised no objection to this conditional on appropriate accommodation and suitable insurance cover being provided and subject to the National Museum of Ireland being satisfied with the accommodation.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;housing&rdquo; of the <i>Asgard</i> has recently been examined by officials of the National Museum of Ireland. The ARP has been verbally advised that the current accommodation is most unsatisfactory and a formal notice to this effect is being issued to the ARP. The &ldquo;Licence to Alter&rdquo; issued by my Department in respect of the <i>Asgard</i>, requires the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project to provide the director of the National Museum of Ireland, with a detailed proposal or work schedule in relation to the proposed work of alteration. It is also a condition of the licence that access is provided to the National Museum of Ireland to inspect work in progress. This work has not yet commenced.</P>
      <P>I understand that a schedule for the work involved will not be prepared until after the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project has raised the additional private funding necessary to carry out the restoration. In the meantime the location of the <i>Asgard </i>is primarily a matter for the vessel's owner, the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <Quest>if she will provide every landowner who objects to the habitats directive regulations with the complete scientific file at initial object stage, all internal correspondence between officials of Government Departments and all correspondence to Europe and documentation in relation to site selection on their lands in order to comply with stated Government policy of openness and transparency.</Quest>

      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, <Col N="768" /> transpose the EU habitats directive into Irish law. Under section 5 of the regulations a person may object on scientific grounds to a proposed designation of his or her lands. The procedure that is in place for doing this is as follows: the landowner is asked to contact Dúchas the Heritage Service of my Department initially. If the matter cannot be resolved on an informal basis, the landowner is then advised to make a formal appeal to the SAC appeals advisory board set up by me for this purpose. When this notice of appeal is received by Dúchas, two copies of the documentation that forms the basis for the proposed designation are made. One copy is sent to the landowner-appellant and the other copy is sent to the appeals board. These documents include certification form, appeal documentation, SAC map, site map, site card, site synopsis, habitat and species list and Natura 2000 form.</P>
      <P>In effect this documentation is forwarded to a landowner as soon as it is needed by him-her, that is, when it is found that Dúchas cannot accede to the objection to the designation and the landowner wishes to proceed with an appeal to the SAC appeals advisory board. If an individual landowner wishes to receive such detailed documentation at an earlier stage, it will be supplied on request free of charge. Copies of correspondence with the European Commission are not considered to be relevant to individual site selection, and would not be supplied automatically. Such information may be sought under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, but there may be a charge.</P>

      <P>Compensation is available for losses of income or costs incurred by landowners as a result of restrictions arising from the designation of their lands as part of a special area of conservation. The compensation provisions cover actual losses but not perceived losses of potential income. They cover restrictions on existing commercial activities and are not confined to agricultural land uses. The compensation provisions, as they relate to agriculture, require EU approval as a State aid. A scheme has been submitted to the EU Commission and I expect formal approval in the near future.</P>

      <P>My Department has been given responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A sum of £250 million has been allocated to my Department over this period. This funding has an equal opportunities perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment. Capital funding is available to community and self-employed child care providers while staffing supports are available to community groups. Funding is also available for quality improvement projects. My Department was also allocated additional funding of £26.5 million under the Government's anti-inflationary package for child care.</P>
      <P>Table 1 outlines the number of applications received, by county, for staffing grants as well as the total approved and paid out by county up to 30 March 2001. Table 2 outlines similar details in respect of capital grants.</P>

      <Col N="773" /> In the case of capital grant applications, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many cases contractors are unable to begin work on projects as soon as had been expected due to other work commitments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked about the number of <Col N="774" /> applications per county received in relation to the budget 2000 allocation of £20 million for grant aid towards the infrastructural development of child care facilities. I assume the Deputy is referring to the funding available for capital works in child care facilities. Table 3 outlines the capital funding approved during 2000 as well as capital funding paid out to the end of 2000.</P>

    <P>Due to the fact that the equal opportunities child care programme is EU-funded within the National Development Plan 2000-06, the funding for the 2000 could not be allocated until the operational programmes and the Community support framework was agreed between Ireland and the EU. For this reason funding could not be released until July 2000, six months into the finance year. The allocation for the first six months of 2000 was, therefore, backloaded for expenditure during 2001 to 2006.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, following a recent decision of the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs aimed at streamlining the processing of applications for child care facilities, responsibility for £12.5 million towards schools-based child care initiatives was transferred to my Department from the Department of Education and Science. Of this, £2.5 million is intended to promote the release of spare classrooms for use as child care facilities. Under this initiative, grants will be made available to schools where the management makes spare classrooms available for the provision of child care.</P>
    <P>The funding available could cover the refurbishment of the classroom as well as heating or insurance costs. A survey of primary and post-primary schools in relation to this matter was recently carried out by the Department of Education and Science and is currently being examined by Area Development Management Ltd. in terms of the practicality of the rooms for use as child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The balance of £10 million transferred from the Department of Education and Science includes £5 million allocation under the Government's anti-inflationary package for child care targeted at a national after school initiative, which will be a schools based scheme open to all schools. The Government had already made £5 million available for the provision of after-school child care which is being targeted at schools and communities which experience significant disadvantage. These initiatives are still in the developmental stage.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the equal opportunities child care programme which is operated by my Department. A total of £250 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated over the <Col N="776" /> course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours.</P>
      <P>The programme would welcome further applications for after school programmes for primary school children along with the other groups covered by the programme. The objectives of the programme are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. In addition to this £250 million, my Department was allocated £26.5 million in 2001 as part of the Government's £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care.</P>
      <P>Applications for funding are considered by a programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department. The programme appraisal committee make a recommendation on each application following an initial assessment carried out by Area Development Management Ltd., ADM. Ltd., on behalf of my Department. The assessment of applications is based on material supplied by the applicant in the original application or any additional material requested. No single factor determines the outcome of any application. As outlined in the general guidelines for funding measures which are available from my Department, applications are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project; the level of integration/co-ordination; and the costings/value for money of the proposal.</P>
      <P>So as to enable the assessment of an application under these five criteria, information on a wide range of issues is gathered throughout the appraisal process. A number of factors are considered in assessing applications, including the profile of parents accessing the service; whether the provision of the particular service enables parents from disadvantaged circumstances return to education, training or employment; how the location of the applicant group is rated on the Haase Index of Relative Affluence and Deprivation; the fee structure implemented by the group and its implications for the disadvantaged in the community accessing the service; whether or not the facility facilitates children with special needs or those of ethnic diversity; and the mechanisms that the applicant has put in place to target-focus the service to attract disadvantaged families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recent decision of the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs aimed at streamlining the processing of applications for child care facilities, responsibility for £5 million for out of school child care has now transferred to my Department from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as well as £12.5 <Col N="777" /> million towards child care initiatives targeted at schools which has been transferred from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Of the £12.5 million transferred from the Department of Education and Science, £5 million will be used to support schools who develop and manage school-based after school hours child are. It is envisaged that this funding will be targeted at schools and communities which experience significant disadvantage while the remaining £5 million will be open to all schools. Both primary and post-primary schools will be involved. The remaining £2.5 million is intended to promote the release of spare classrooms for use as child care facilities. Under this initiative, grants will be made available to schools where the management makes spare classrooms available for the provision of child care. These initiatives are still in the developmental stage and will be advertised as soon as policy details are finalised.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, schemes for capital and staffing grants for community not for profit group(s) and capital for private child care providers are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Funding is available for community based or not for profit groups or private providers, including childminders, who provide child care services. Applications for funding under these measures can be made by submitting the relevant application form to my Department's equal opportunities child care section. Completed applications for funding are assessed initially, on behalf of the Department, by Area Development Management Ltd. This is followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision. The assessment criteria for these measures include the extent to which the project will increase the number of child care places, the quality and financial sustainability of the proposal as well as the capacity of the service provider to implement the project.</P>
      <P>Up to 6 April 2001 my Department's equal opportunities child care section had received 35 applications for funding from child care providers in County Kerry. To date I have approved funding, under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, to 22 child care services in County Kerry to the value of £2.87 million. This funding will support more than 600 child care places in County Kerry, including almost 280 new child care places. Funding was also approved for staffing costs for area partnerships around the country including £4,000 for North Kerry Together in Listowel. Two projects have been deemed ineligible for funding on the basis that the projects did not meet the criteria of the programme.</P>
      <P>The following table details the level of grant-aid which has been awarded in County Kerry since July 2000.</P>

      <P>The European Union Action Plan on Drugs, 2000-2004, is the principle European Union measure dealing with the problem of drug misuse. The action plan sets out detailed measures to achieve the objectives and targets in the EU Drugs Strategy, 2000-2004.</P>
      <P>The EU strategy sets out the main aims and targets and focuses on a balanced approach to reducing the demand and supply of drugs. The aims of this five year strategy are to reduce: the prevalence of illicit drug use among young people; the incidence of drug related health damage and drug related deaths; the availability of illicit drugs; drug related crime; money laundering and illicit trafficking in precursors and to increase the number of successfully treated addicts.</P>
      <P>The EU Action Plan on Drugs, 2000-2004, sets out detailed measures to achieve the objectives and targets of the EU Drugs Strategy. It is divided into five key areas, namely, co-ordination; information and evaluation; demand reduction, prevention of drug use and of drug related crime; supply reduction; and international co-operation.</P>
      <P>Evaluations at mid term and on completion of the EU Drugs Strategy, 2000-2004, will ensure that member states account for the actions they have taken in accordance with the relevant sections of the action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of European institutions with responsibility to assist countries in combating both the supply and demand for drugs. Principal among these institutions are the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, and Europol. The principal objective of the EMCDDA is to provide reliable and comparable information on drug misuse throughout the EU. Europol supports member states in tackling drug trafficking and other serious international crime, by facilitating the exchange of information and intelligence and by <Col N="782" /> providing technical analytical and co-ordination services.</P>
    <P>In addition, EU working groups have been established to provide greater co-ordination in the field of combating drug trafficking and a number of EU funded initiatives such as the Oisin and PHARE Programmes enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement measures.</P>
    <P>The EU has made considerable progress in developing national and EU strategies to tackle the drug problem and will continue to afford it the highest priority.</P>

      <P>The Sports Campus Ireland project has been tendered to the market on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. This is a three stage process. The first stage was where Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, invited expressions of interest from qualifying consortia. The closing date for this stage was 8 January last. Following assessment, shortlisted consortia have now been invited to make outline bids. The final stage will be a detailed negotiation with not more than three consortia. CSID has estimated the Exchequer cost of the project at £350 million. When the outline bids have been received and the tender process proceeds to detailed negotiations it will be <Col N="783" /> possible to move progressively from these estimates to contractual figures.</P>

      <P>While I understand that Monaghan Urban District Council is preparing a proposal in relation to the pool in Monaghan, an application for the provision of funding for this project has not been received under the local authority swimming pool programme. All local authorities were invited to submit proposals for the development of pools to my Department by 31 July 2000 and all proposals received by that closing date are being processed under the present programme.</P>
      <P>In general, there are four stages in a swimming pool project &ndash; preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. The Department's technical advisers evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from this Department. Monaghan UDC have been advised of this in relation to the appointment of consultants.</P>
      <P>In deciding which applications are to be funded under the programme, the Department will give consideration to such matters as the need for a swimming pool in an area; suitability of the proposed site; future viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues; construction and operating standards of existing facilities; satisfactory financial plan; and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 285 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no immediate plans to expand the home-schoolcommunity liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be aware of the new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; that I announced last January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme, which will run over a three-year period, will cost some £26 million and involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts. Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The schools in question are included in the urban dimension of the programme and are eligible to receive supplementary grant aid over the three-year period towards the provision of suitable educational supports and could involve additional measures to support the children concerned at home and in the community. The County Waterford school in question and Scoil Bhríde National School are eligible to receive £7,590 and £6,454 respectively in respect of the current school year. The schools were not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>

      <P>My Department understands the student to whom the Deputy refers is attending a diploma course at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and has been refused a maintenance grant by City of Galway VEC, under the terms of the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees is administered by the vocational education committees under the aegis of my Department. The scheme applies to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects in line with the Government's sectoral employment priorities and who are entering approved middle level technician or higher technical and business skills courses for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme maintenance grants are not payable to students who have completed more than the first year of a degree level course. As the student to whom the Deputy refers has already completed more than one year of a <Col N="796" /> degree course at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology he is ineligible for the award of a maintenance grant for his diploma course.</P>
    <P>The schemes of student support are of general application and, accordingly, it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons retired primary school teachers must forfeit their pension when acting in the capacity of temporary assistant teacher in place of a permanent teacher on a career break who is not in receipt of salary, but may retain their pension when acting as a substitute teacher for a permanent teacher on paid leave; and if he will take the necessary steps to repair this anomaly.</Quest>

      <P>The superannuation scheme for national teachers provides that a pension will cease in the event of the return to wholetime work of a teacher who has retired on pension. At the end of the period of wholetime work, the pension will be resumed.</P>
      <P>Payment of pension continues without interruption in the event of return to work in a part-time capacity as a substitute teacher.</P>
      <P>A substitute teacher is employed to replace a teacher who is on paid leave of absence, for example, on sick leave. A temporary wholetime teacher is employed where there is no permanent teacher or where the permanent teacher is on unpaid leave of absence, for example, on a career break. These provisions are designed to ensure that two wholetime salaries will not be payable in respect of one teaching post.</P>
      <P>Wholetime employment involves payment of incremental salary and allowances, with the exception of post of responsibility allowances, on the same basis as before retirement. On the other hand, employment as a substitute is on the basis of payment of the part-time daily rate, currently £81.18 per day. A substitute teacher who was employed throughout the school year, a very rare occurrence, would earn about £16,000 at current values. This is less than half of the rate of pay, more than £34,000 per year at current values, which would typically be payable to a teacher who takes up temporary wholetime work after retirement.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the current provisions. They will, of course, be reviewed when the Part-time Worker's Bill has been enacted.</P>

      <Quest>the types of funding and financial assistance available to mature and second chance education students returning to or entering third level education.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10434/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. Under the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students attending full-time undergraduate <Col N="800" /> courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>The other schemes of student support for third level students have similar provisions.</P>
      <P>Maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of grant is payable in all other cases. The full rate of adjacent and non-adjacent grant for the current academic year is £710 and £1,775, respectively.</P>
      <P>From 1999-00, as part of a funding initiative at third level, the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is paid to all eligible mature students irrespective of distance from college.</P>
      <P>Students who are repeating a year of study at the same level are generally not eligible for funding. However, since 1994 the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committees scholarship scheme have included a concession for &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students returning to college after a break of at least five years having previously pursued, but not completed, a third level course. This concession allows such students to be funded again for periods of study at the same level. Prior to 1994, a student did not receive financial assistance until they had completed the equivalent amount of time spent on their original course, irrespective of the length of time which had elapsed between the two periods of college attendance. There are similar arrangements applying for second chance students under the free fees initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to <Col N="801" /> their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college to complete their studies. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>Last September I appointed an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. The group's terms of reference required that it advise me, <i>inter alia</i>, on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>
      <P>I have recently received the report of the action group. The report contains recommendations relating to the operational details of the special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students which I announced last September. I am at present considering the recommendations and would hope to be in a position to make an initial response in the near future.</P>

      <P>Until the end of the year 2000, an educational psychologist employed by my Department in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provided a psychological service to all post-primary schools in County Cavan. This psychologist also had responsibilities in County Dublin. The area based partnership in Cavan also <Col N="802" /> employed a psychologist to serve approximately 2,000 pupils in the county.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Government that NEPS should develop a psychological service that would eventually be available to all schools, NEPS embarked on a programme of recruitment. Some 31 additional psychologists have been appointed since last September. This has allowed NEPS to enhance considerably the psychological service in the north eastern region.</P>
      <P>Two NEPS psychologists have now been assigned to join the Cavan team and are based in Cavan town. They are continuing the service to post-primary schools and have taken responsibility for the schools previously served by the Cavan partnership. NEPS is now offering a psychological service to approximately 21 primary schools in Cavan town, Bailieborough and Cootehill.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that when all primary schools in the county have access to the NEPS service, there will be five psychologists serving counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>

      <P>I launched the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from education<Col N="803" /> ally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be supported where necessary through the three year period through staff allocations to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes.</P>
      <P>Rural schools with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be allocated the services of a teacher or co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Rural schools that could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher or co-ordinator support.</P>
      <P>All schools participating in the programme will also receive financial support for the delivery of targeted in-school and out-of-school actions.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £6,454 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and the circumstances of these schools would then be further considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question have now been forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. As soon as the ERC has examined the representations and reported to my Department, the school will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 302 and 324 together.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates additional teaching resources to second level schools to cater for the needs of Traveller children enrolled in them. The additional allocation is generally of the order of 1.5 hours per pupil per week.</P>
      <P>The authorities of second level schools must take a number of factors into account when deciding on the number of teachers who may be employed in a permanent capacity in a particular school year. These factors include the approved initial teacher allocation for the school for that year, the number of permanent teachers on approved leave, the overall limits as to level of permanency laid down by my Department from time to time and the need for flexibility to cater for the needs of all pupils attending the school. The assignment of teachers to individual classes within the overall approved allocation is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department provides ongoing in-career development programmes for second level teachers working with traveller pupils. The national education officer for Travellers advises my Department of the needs in this area.</P>
      <P>The national education officer has also established a professional focus group from among the visiting teachers' service to examine intercultural issues and anti-racism in an educational context. The work of this group will inform the design and delivery of inservice to the teachers concerned, including teachers of travellers in particular.</P>
      <P>Also, new guidelines for traveller education have been produced for all second level teachers and in particular for those working with traveller pupils. The guidelines will strengthen the role of the resource teacher for travellers and provide the opportunity to share expertise, develop best practice and promote an intercultural approach. The guidelines include a section on intercultural training and its application in schools. The intention is to issue the guidelines early in the next school year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that my Department is the first to appoint a preferred bidder for projects under the Government's pilot public private partnership programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department identified five new post-primary schools as suitable for inclusion in the pilot PPP programme. These schools are located in Ballincollig, County Cork, Clones, County Monaghan, Dunmanway, County Cork, Shannon, <Col N="807" /> County Clare and Tubbercurry, County Sligo. The trustees and management of the schools were approached and agreed to their inclusion in the process.</P>
    <P>The role of the schools and my Department in the PPP process is to specify educational outputs and, consequently, my Department did not appoint design teams or contractors, or prepare specifications for the construction or services elements of the contracts. The output-based nature of the PPP process encourages innovation in school design, construction and servicing.</P>
    <P>Following an EU-wide tender process, Jarvis plc has been selected as the preferred bidder for the five new post-primary schools and contract negotiations with my Department have commenced. In terms of the article to which the Deputy refers, all of the schools were designed by Irish design teams and will be constructed by Irish contractors.</P>
    <P>Jarvis will provide the five schools with all the curriculum-related range of education facilities, furnishings, equipment and IT, together with ongoing services such as building, equipment and services maintenance, cleaning, security and ground maintenance. The maintenance and facilities management contract will run for 25 years and this impacts on the quality of the buildings to be provided.</P>
    <P>The management of the schools and their day to day running will remain with the school management authorities and the State will retain legal ownership of all properties. Subject to the planning process, it is intended that construction will commence in early summer and the five new schools will be available from September 2002.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that material relating to these PPP projects was sent to the Oireachtas Library by my Department.</P>

These figures were based on statistics relating to future output from primary schools in the catchment area and on recent enrolment trends in the post-primary school in question. The matter was discussed with the school authorities at the time and my Department understood that there was agreement that the figures were realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the school in question considers that there are grounds for reviewing the projected enrol<Col N="808" /> ment figures, my Department's planning section in Tullamore would be open to considering any new information which the school may provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations contained in the report referred to by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Level</i>1. In areas of significant housing development a consultative forum should be established to collate information and provide advice to the Department of Education and Science on the planning of educational provision at first and second level.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Lucan Area</i>2. The steering group of the commission should submit recommendations to the Minister for Education and Science regarding the timing of the establishment of new schools in the Lucan area.</P>
      <P>3. After consultation with patrons and trustees and planning authorities, the Department of Education and Science should ensure that sites are reserved for first and second level schools in the area referred to as Adamstown.</P>
      <P>4. The Department of Education and Science should liaise with Bus Éireann for the provision of transport facilities to maximise access from the more recent housing estates to the existing schools in the Lucan area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first recommendation, Department officials, together with the chairperson of the Commission on School Accommodation, meet regularly with the four Dublin local authorities and the various school patron bodies to discuss first and second level school provision in the area in the light of development proposals. It is open to such patron bodies to seek recognition for new schools as they consider appropriate. Meetings also take place between my Department and other local authorities as the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second recommendation, regular contact is maintained between the <Col N="810" /> Commission on school accommodation and my Department regarding the planning of school provision in Lucan and other developing areas.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the third recommendation, sites for a first level and a second level school have been reserved in the Adamstown area. A further site for a first level school has been reserved in the Griffeen-Foxborough area. The question of whether to proceed with the development of schools on these sites is under consideration at present. In that regard, I understand that South Dublin County Council is at present preparing a proposed plan for Adamstown, which I expect will help to clarify whether additional school provision is required to serve this area. The proposed plan is expected to be available towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fourth recommendation, my Department's school transport section is not aware of any transport difficulties for pupils to which development in the area may have given rise. However, the position will continue to be monitored and any emerging problems will be promptly addressed.</P>

      <P>Up to the end of the year 2000 two educational psychologists, employed by my Department in the national educational psychological service, provided a psychological service to all post-primary schools in the city and county of Waterford. Neither of these psychologists was based in Waterford and both had responsibilities in other counties.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Government that NEPS should develop a psychological service that would eventually be available to all schools, NEPS embarked on a programme of recruitment. Since last September 31 additional psychologists have been appointed. This has allowed NEPS to enhance considerably the psychological service in the south eastern region.</P>
      <P>Two NEPS psychologists have now been assigned to work exclusively in County Waterford. They have already begun work in post-primary schools and are now initiating a service to primary schools. It is envisaged that they will be able to provide a psychological service initially to all post-primary students in the city and county and to 41 primary schools in Waterford city, Kilmacthomas, Stradbally, Ballyduff and Tramore. Office accommodation is currently being refurbished and is almost ready so that there will soon be a NEPS office in the city.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that when all primary schools in the county have access to the NEPS service there will be five psychologists serving County Waterford.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy that Traveller children in post-primary schools participate in mainstream education in age appropriate classes and in an integrated setting. To ensure that this policy translates into practice, my Department provides extra teaching hours and pays capitation grants at an enhanced rate in respect of Traveller pupils. My Department employs a national education officer for Travellers and a visiting teacher service for Travellers. Recently I increased the number of posts in the visiting teacher service to 40 thus ensuring that a nationwide service can be provided.</P>
      <P>Each year my Department provides inservice training for teachers in accordance with needs identified in conjunction with the national education officer and the visiting teachers. The visiting teachers provide advice and support to schools and to Traveller families and are involved in the organisation and delivery of in-service training.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly issue guidelines on Traveller education in post-primary schools. These will contain information, advice and guidance in relation to a range of issues, including the integration of Travellers into the life of the school, the validation of Traveller culture and the promotion of an intercultural approach.</P>

In many cases the numbers enrolled in an individual school are such that the additional allocation under this provision would be less than a full post.</P>
    <P>The appointment of teachers and the subject areas involved is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned. When deciding on the number of teaching posts, if any, which may be filled in a permanent capacity in a particular school year, the school authorities must take account of the approved teacher allocation for the school for that year, the number of permanent teachers currently employed, including those on approved leave, the overall limits as to the level of permanency laid down by my Department from time to time and the need for flexibility to cater for the needs of all of the pupils, including Traveller children, attending the school. The assignment of teachers to individual classes within the overall approved allocation is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned.</P>

      <P>With effect from the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year, all schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an <i>ex-quota</i> allocation in respect of remedial education. The actual allocation to an individual school is determined by the enrolment. All pupils enrolled in the school concerned have access to this support.</P>
      <P>In addition to the allocation in respect of remedial education, my Department makes an additional allocation of 1.5 hours per pupil per week in respect of each Traveller pupil enrolled in an individual school. The question of increasing this support will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the existing provision within individual schools.</P>
      <P>In the current school year 15.5 additional whole-time teacher equivalents have been allocated to second level schools in County Galway to cater for the needs of Traveller pupils enrolled therein. A total of 17 whole-time teacher equivalents have been allocated to the schools in question in respect of remedial education. All Traveller pupils enrolled in second level schools in County Galway have access to the visiting teacher service.</P>

      <P>At present there are 80 psychologists serving with the National Educational Psychological Service. Since the beginning of September 2000 there have been 31 appointments and I intend to appoint up to 20 more psychologists before the end of the current school year. In addition, I hope to recruit another 28 psychologists later in this year.</P>
      <P>Most of the newly appointed psychologists have now completed their induction programme and are being assigned to schools. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to extend the NEPS service to primary schools in County Westmeath. The county has been identified as a high priority for future expansion.</P>
      <P>I recognise the effects on some children of their inability to gain access to psychological assessments in situations where a national educational psychological service psychologist has not yet been appointed. Officials of my Department are developing a set of proposals aimed at alleviating the problem, pending the time when it will have achieved its full staffing complement.</P>

      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Students must be attending an undergraduate course or a post-graduate course of not less than one year duration in order to be deemed eligible for assistance.</P>
      <P>The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I significantly increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and my Department does not lay down income threshold limits in relation to those who may be considered eligible to benefit from the fund.</P>

      <P>Students studying at post-graduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or post-graduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>For the year 2000-2001 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710 respectively. A post-graduate grantholder is also eligible to have his-her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible <Col N="819" /> candidates who already hold a post-graduate qualification and who wish to enter a further post-graduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000/01.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-2001 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of people with higher degrees is an important national strategic objective. Apart from the general strategic objective of ensuring a vibrant pool of high quality post-graduates, the success of the substantial investment in our research capability is dependent on an adequate supply of high quality graduates.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 post-graduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-2001. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will be putting in place, within these fields of study, similar post-graduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes can include the awarding by the colleges of post-graduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The <i>per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to the institution and field of study.</P>
    <P>In 2000 49 post-graduate scholarships were awarded under the post-graduate research and development skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>
