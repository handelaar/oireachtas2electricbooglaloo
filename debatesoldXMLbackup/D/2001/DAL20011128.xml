      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Naughten. I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

        <b>: </b>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the loss of 250 jobs at Servis Air; the threat of further job losses at the company and the 2,026 jobs to be shed at Aer Lingus; and the major impact of the 11 September tragedy on the aviation, tourism and related sectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 54, Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 55, Heritage Fund Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 56, Family Support Agency Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 7 &ndash; Road Traffic Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed.

      <P>There are five proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 54 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 55 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 56 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for the taking of Ques<Col N="315" /> tion Time tomorrow agreed? Agreed. I will now take Leaders' Questions and I call on Deputy Noonan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members are aware that it is expected the voluntary redundancy package being offered to Aer Lingus workers will be finalised today. Unfortunately this morning Servis Air announced 250 redundancies at Dublin Airport and predicted losses at Shannon and Cork airports. The company blamed a downturn in the global aviation sector. Because of this further evidence, would the Taoiseach agree it is unlikely that equity for Aer Lingus will be found within the aviation industry? Will he report to the House the progress he or his Ministers are making in getting the EU Commission to allow the Irish Government put equity into Aer Lingus, which is absolutely necessary in parallel with the reconstruction package to save the airline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline where the Government stands in relation to equity and additional funding for Aer Lingus? On the issue of enhancing any redundancy package outside the commercial operations of the company so as to ensure Aer Lingus can obtain the necessary reductions it deems essential to maintain viability, will the Taoiseach confirm the Commission, while concerned about market distortion in relation to State aid for the ongoing commercial operation of the company, is not opposed to the provision of funding for restructuring in relation to social packages, including paying the cost of redundancies? In other words, will the Taoiseach confirm the Commission would have no objection to the Government enhancing any redundancy package in order to get the necessary take-up, provided that financing did not find its way back into the commercial operations of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Servis Air is one of the largest ground handling companies operating in Ireland and the UK with more than 12,000 employees. It has issued protective notice to 250 staff and about 13 other workers have received redundancy notices. The staff concerned provide cargo, courier and ground handling services. The company has been here since 1989 and has made clear it has taken this action because of the fall off in operations and numbers travelling. The Commission for Aviation Regulation has a role in respect of the ground handling industry at Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Aer Lingus, negotiations have continued in the LRC and today it is due to give the conclusions of its deliberations over the past number of weeks. The LRC has remained in close contact with the Minister, the company and the trade unions. I have also kept in touch under the social partnership process with the ICTU, the trade unions and the company, as has the Minister who has had a number of meetings. The survival plan is at a very sensitive stage. A number <Col N="316" /> of amendments have been made to it in the negotiations, including on the outsourcing of workers to keep employees within the operation, on staff over 55 years of age and on other aspects, including on pay issues and cost factors, particularly in the context of the PPF and the ability of the company to pay the terms set out. It has also examined what would happen in any ultimate sale. These matters have been discussed at length and there has been some progress on them. We must now wait to see what happens.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the effort being made as part of the plan is to sustain as many jobs in Aer Lingus as possible under the best possible terms and to give the best terms possible to those who have to leave on retirement or redundancy packages. Everybody has acted in good faith.</P>
    <P>The Government has continued to keep in touch with the EU and the Commissioner in relation to what can be done. The Commission has not changed its position. Regarding Deputy Quinn's question as to what is allowed, that issue has been explored extensively by the Department. The EU Commission has not opened the position in relation to other airlines and has been very rigid in that regard. We will continue to make our case as part of the survival plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that negotiations on the redundancy package are at a delicate stage and the difficulties for management, staff and the families of staff who may be made redundant. Therefore, I do not want to ask in particular about the negotiations on the redundancy package but rather focus on the provision of equity which is absolutely necessary for the future of Aer Lingus. It seems it will be difficult to get equity from within the aviation industry. What progress is the Government making in its contacts with the EU Commission? I have been informed by a reliable source that the Government, despite all the talk and all the answers given in the House, has made no written submission to the EU Commission requesting equity. Is this correct? If not, it should be denied immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy said about the negotiations being at a sensitive stage and what is involved is well understood by the company and the LRC &ndash; there are no great secrets. Whatever about letters which have formally been passed by the Department, the officials of the Department have had a number of meetings directly with the Commission.</P>

      <P>Newspapers report today that Dublin Bus has put on hold some major developments in terms of the national development plan, including the acquisition of land at Ballymun-Harristown for 52 million, which would be an integral part of its modernised bus facility as part of the national development plan &ndash; it is extensively reported in one of today's national newspapers &ndash; because it cannot get clarity from the Government in relation to future financial commitments. The acute traffic situation in Dublin does not require any detailed description. The plan is for Dublin Bus to increase its fleet from 1,000 to 1,500, including 250 buses which would be managed by a subcontractor. However, this can only occur if there is a commitment in relation to funding and if CIE and its subsidiary company, Dublin Bus, are in a position to acquire land at Harristown and also in Tallaght. They cannot get a clear commitment on funding from the Government. As a consequence, the national development plan is now seriously delayed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the fact that the plans of Dublin Bus to help solve the traffic problems in Dublin cannot now go ahead, because of the inadequacy of the Estimate, is further evidence that his Government has squandered the boom and, after four and a half years in office, still left us with all the difficulties? I know the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regards this as humorous, but, then, we regard him as very funny also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Bus, like every other institution, will get its allocation for next year from the relevant Department. In recent years, as the Deputy will agree, since the eight QBCs were put in place, Dublin Bus has acquired 275 extra buses, all wheelchair accessible. Bus Éireann has 74 new buses. All the new buses scheduled for last year and this year are now on their routes and all the targets which the Minister for Public Enterprise set out in 1998 have been fulfilled. I <Col N="319" /> do not know the figures for next year, but all commitments to date have been met. The capacity of Bus Éireann buses has been increased by about 40% and there is also an increase in the capacity of Dublin Bus on all QBCs. I am sure that, whatever allocation is made for next year and whatever discussions take place between the company and the Minister for Public Enterprise will be equally successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from the Taoiseach's reply that this newspaper story is a piece of fiction? It is pointless for him to talk about QBCs &ndash; that is not what I asked about. Can I return to the question I asked? The Government's much vaunted national development plan was a seven year programme in which consistency and commitment in relation to spend are an integral part. It is not a matter of seven disconnected years of expenditure &ndash; they are supposed to be seven inter-connected years of expenditure. In order to have forward planning, CIE and its subsidiary, Dublin Bus, need a commitment in respect of certain capital funds, to wit, 52 million for the purchase of land at Ballymun-Harristown. The fact that old clapped out buses have been replaced has nothing to do with the national development plan, <i>per se</i>. What is required is the additional buses to increase the fleet by up to 50% and those buses cannot be purchased, nor can commitments to purchase them be entered upon, until such time as a place to house them is provided for. That is the import of today's newspaper story. Will the Taoiseach, please, answer the question put to him? Why is a company 100% owned by the State unable to get clarity from the stakeholder, that is, the Government, in relation to commitments about which the Government is well informed concerning expenditure for the next couple of years? </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is £1.5 billion being spent on public transport and traffic management, including the provision for Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and other initiatives. The individual figures for 2002 will be negotiated between the Department of Public Enterprise and, in this case, Bus Éireann, following the production of the Book of Estimates. It is the intention of the Minister for Public Enterprise, in the light of the national development plan as in other areas, to accede to those issues that are in the plan. If they are not in the plan, then there is a difficulty. I am not quite sure whether the issues which the Deputy is raising are in the plan. If they are, it is the Minister's intention to provide for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, after line 44, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister may specify in an order made under <i>subsection (3)(f2&gt;a)</i> requirements as to the total prudent market value of relevant mortgage credit assets that can be included in a cover assets pool, expressed as a percentage of the prudent market value of the total mortgage credit assets and substitution assets that are included in the pool. For the purposes of this subsection, mortgage credit assets are relevant mortgage credit assets if they are comprised of mortgage credits of a kind specified in the order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 defines the credits which may comprise mortgage credits for the purpose of the Bill. Section 4(3) empowers the Minister to designate by order further types of credit which may comprise mortgage credits for the purpose of the Bill. This will build flexibility into the Bill and ensure the Irish asset covered security market can respond to developments in the sector internationally. Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage when Deputy McGrath spoke on the issue the Minister's order making power under the section was extended to enable the Minister to supply or modify certain provisions of the Bill from credits designated as mortgage credits by ministerial order. These provisions related to loan <Col N="330" /> to value ratios and to holdings of mortgage credit assets in G7 countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and other OECD countries. The reason for providing for this flexibility in the Bill was that, as drafted, there would be difficulties in including securitised mortgages in the definition of mortgage credit if the European asset covered securities market develops in that way and the inclusion of such assets is considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The proposed Report Stage amendment allows the Minister to stipulate maximum percentages of cover asset pools which may be comprised of assets designated as mortgage credit assets by ministerial order, whether these are securitised mortgages or some other type of asset. This is a prudent measure which will enable the Minister to allow the inclusion of new types of assets in pools while ensuring pools continue to be primarily comprised of residential mortgages. In proposing this amendment, I stress to the House that I have no immediate intention of designating securitised mortgages or any other type of asset as a mortgage credit. What I am seeking to do is ensure the Minister's power to designate new types of mortgage credit enables the Minister to limit the percentage of cover asset pools which may be comprised of these new types of mortgage credit assets. This will build flexibility into the Bill while maintaining the conservative nature and integrity of the product. Amendment No. 4 is an analogous provision relating to public credits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this amendment which I support. There is a later amendment in my name in relation to credit enhancement mortgages and their acceptance in bonds. Will they be covered in the flexibility about which the Minister is talking in amendment No. 4, which states that the Minister can make orders subsequently or in discussion with the financial institutions and the Central Bank could make facilities available to allow this credit enhancement to take place? Will the Minister of State clarify if that is covered in the amendment or will I need to proceed with my amendment later?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 36, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(15) Where a mortgage credit asset has insurance or another form of credit enhancement acceptable to the Authority, the Authority may, by notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, increase the relevant mortgage loan to value ratio which applies to the relevant mortgage credit asset by such percentage as is specified in that notice.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to one I moved on Committee Stage and is a very important part of any new legislation that comes forward in this sector. As the Ceann Comhairle will be well aware from his many years in this House representing his constituents, household mortgages represent a large part of lending in this country &ndash; I understand it is about 25% of total lending. We have a very high rate of home ownership here, it is close to 80% which is different to most countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that is now before the House is modelled on the German model but it is different to it from the point of view of the loan to value rating which we have increased to 75% while it is at 60% in Germany. Individual home ownership is <Col N="332" /> at a much higher rate here. I see a problem with the loan to value rating because some 40% of new mortgages taken out here are higher than the 75% loan to value ratio referred to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware from his own constituency that most young people buying houses now are lucky to be able to put down a deposit of 5%, never mind the 25% that might be required. In those cases people get mortgage enhancement insurance to top up the amount borrowed. This is acceptable in the modern world in terms of a lending arrangement and it is quite secure.</P>
    <P>If the legislation goes through as it is now, the mortgage enhancement insurance will not be allowable and it could mean the level of competition and the level of funding would not be available to mortgagees to the extent that it should be. This will discriminate against people who are borrowing high percentages for their mortgage &ndash; those who are seeking to borrow more than 75% on the loan to value ratio. People who are better off and can afford to borrow less than that will be able to get into this bond market but not those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>If we want to help the lower end of the market and provide competition, then we should accept mortgage enhancement. We are not opening the door very wide on this occasion because there is the added protection that any arrangements made in relation to this and the securitisation of those bonds has to be agreed with the Central Bank. This recognises that it can be done but the regulations and the detail involved in it will be the responsibility of the Central Bank. It can be a help, so rather than shutting the door on it I ask the Minister of State to consider allowing this.</P>
    <P>It is already built into legislation in France and is part of proposed legislative change in other European countries. It has the backing of The Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association who are substantial players in the financial market and I cannot understand why the Minister of State will not move in that direction. The Minister of State moved in the direction recommended by the financial institutions with many amendments and that is to be welcomed. A substantial sector of the financial market is asking the Minister of State to include this in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister of State to tell me that we will come back to this at a later date and bring forward an amendment if it is necessary because we have both been here long enough to know that the next time an amendment comes to this Bill we will both be out on grass. This may not be the case with Deputy McDowell as longevity is a feature of the Labour Party as shown by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister of State to take a serious look at this as it will improve the situation for the lower end of the market here. It <Col N="333" /> is recognised within the financial markets and I hope that will be influential in getting this accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows this case is largely being made by participants in the financial services sector who believe that we should make enhanced credit an acceptable part of the asset covered base. I started off with a measure of scepticism about it and I am still not totally convinced but I think there is a decent case that must be answered.</P>
      <P>The major demand for this Bill has come from foreign-based banks who will use largely foreign-based securities in order to engage in re-financing along the lines set out in the Bill. For most of these banks this is not a problem in any sense because their mortgage base is largely made up of mortgages that are less than 75% and do not use enhanced credit.</P>
      <P>If the Irish building societies and banks are to use this method of re-financing in a serious way they will have to or will want to use at least a certain block of mortgages that use enhanced credit. If we do not allow enhanced credit to be considered as part of the base we could, unintentionally, make it more difficult for Irish-based financial institutions, building societies and banks to use this method of re-financing and therefore, at least in part, defeat the purpose that we are intent on addressing in this Bill in the first place.</P>
      <P>Enhanced credit is solid and the insurance companies engaged in providing it are triple-A credit rated companies. The argument that has been made to me on that score is persuasive, that if the enhanced credit is solid and reliable and can be called into play in all cases then surely it is reasonable to consider that the mortgage and the loan to value ratio that is used is also fairly solid and reliable.</P>
      <P>I actively supported the Minister of State's argument that we should look to ensure that the asset base for re-financing is absolutely rock solid, because if it is not, then we are deluding ourselves and it goes to the core of the Bill. If the insurance which underpins mortgages of above 75% is in itself rock solid then the argument can be confidently made that we can take mortgages up to 90% or even 92% into the asset base on which re-financing can be based. This argument deserves a hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what both Deputies said and I do not see any disagreement between us on this issue. Perhaps we are just coming at it from two different angles and I will try to set out what I hope will clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>Following Committee Stage I gave some consideration to this amendment and I discussed the proposal with the industry. After much discussion I decided I could not accept the amendment. What is now proposed fits the criteria set out by most of those who argued in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The Bill does not prevent designated credit institutions from including new mortgages which have loan to value ratios in excess of 75% in covered asset pools. They can be as high as they like, there is no bar on that at all. It simply requires that the amount of the mortgage in excess of the 75% ratio is disregarded for the purpose of valuing the pool.</P>
    <P>This is important in the context of the strength and quality of the product that will be on offer here. I am aware that in Luxembourg, for instance, where OECD countries are included, they find it very hard to sell the product as there is insufficient confidence in it. The quality of the pool is of vital importance. There can be mortgages of 80%, 90% or 100% but we want to ensure the value and credibility of this pool is real and permanent.</P>
    <P>Mortgages can be taken in beyond the 75% of value ratio but anything above that will be disregarded. This will make sure the inherent strength of the pool remains rock solid.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a loan to value ratio of 75% on mortgages in covered asset pools. The amendment proposes that where a mortgage is covered by indemnity insurance the Central Bank can increase the loan to value ratio and thus the enhanced credit provided by the insurance would be recognised in the valuation of the mortgage and the covered asset pool. Mortgage indemnity insurance provides that when a mortgage is defaulted on, the lending institution repossesses and sells the property. If the realised sum for the sale is less than the amount of the mortgage the insurer pays the difference to the lender.</P>
    <P>However, the key concept behind the covered asset pools is their dynamic nature. When a mortgage becomes non-performing it should be removed from the pool and replaced with a new performing mortgage credit or substitution asset that generates an income that can be used to meet the claims of security holders. Thus, by the time an institution receives a payment from a mortgage indemnity insurer in respect of a non-performing loan, the mortgage should have been removed from the covered asset pool anyway. It does not remain in it and, therefore, the sum received from the insurer is of no benefit to the holders of the institution's asset covered securities.</P>
    <P>This is different to the position in regard to conventional securitisation. Bonds are backed by a fixed pool of assets in conventional securitisation. Mortgages on which there are defaults cannot be replaced. It makes sense in these circumstances to have indemnity insurance on mortgages backing the bonds as this will assist in ensuring the claim of bond holders can be met. Credit enhancement may be of use in covered asset pools in scenarios of extreme stress such as when institutions have become insolvent and no new assets may enter the pools. The Bill provides for this through the use of covered assets hedged contracts, which were mentioned on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> However, all of us would agree there is no reason to increase loan to value ratios in pools because of extreme circumstances. In France, 100% loan to value ratios are allowed on some mortgages in covered asset pools. This is because the French Government guarantees the mortgages of some mortgagees if they get into financial difficulties. It is a different position to Ireland. If this guarantee is called, the payments on the mortgage continue. It does not go into default and can, therefore, remain in the pool because it is guaranteed by the state. This is quite different to the circumstances in which mortgage indemnity insurance would be called on.</P>
    <P>During the drafting of the legislation I tried to facilitate domestic lending institutions as much as possible. The increase in loan to value ratios from 60% to 75% on Committee Stage was a direct result of representations by the industry. However, it is also vital to its success that the Irish mortgage covered security is regarded internationally as a conservative product similar to other European mortgage covered bonds. I am not in favour of providing an increase in loan to value ratios in the circumstances proposed in the amendment. I emphasise that because the loan to value ratio is 75% that does not mean higher mortgages cannot be included but their value is disregarded above 75%, which is prudent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification. Is the Minister of State saying part of a mortgage can be included in the bonds up to the value of 75% and the balance is not considered so that the mortgage is divided for the purposes of the asset pool?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The entire mortgage is included but only a value of 75% is placed on it in the pool. Mortgages are not divided. Only 75% of the mortgage is given a value in the pool. That is prudent and ensures the value of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the financial institutions, who will be instructed and guided by the regulations drawn up by the Central Bank, are happy with the enhancement value of mortgages, does the Minister of State think a case could be made for its inclusion because, if he excludes it, many financial institutions feel they will be at a competitive disadvantage, which will mean mortgage applicants will also be at a competitive disadvan<Col N="336" /> tage as they will have to pay more for their mortgages as a result? The Minister of State could surely accept the amendment on that basis and the Central Bank could provide the guarantees to which we have referred. We want the guarantees to be rock solid but the amendment should be accepted because of the strong case made by certain quarters in the financial services industry. I ask him to reconsider the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister of State's comments which make sense. I am a little concerned about the obligation the legislation puts on those monitoring the assets within a particular pool to keep a tally. They must first calculate the prudent market value of a property and then they must disregard some of the mortgage or the security.</P>

      <P>No, in the context of the legislation the Deputies will appreciate extensive discussions were held with the IBF and other industry representatives which covered everything. This issue was raised at the last minute but we have given it a great deal of consideration. We have consulted industry representatives and we have been more than fair. It is an excellent product and it would not be wise to go any further. However, nobody is disenfranchised because his or her mortgage has a higher value. The entire mortgage is included but its value is disregarded above the 75% loan to value ratio. We are being more than sensible in that approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 provides that an asset or property is included in, or removed from, a covered assets pool when the appropriate particulars are recorded in the register of mortgage covered securities business. This register contains details of securities issued, the assets in the covered assets pool and cover assets hedge contracts entered into. The circumstances where it is not necessary to make an entry in the register to include assets in, or remove assets from, a covered assets pool are set out in the first sentence of the section, &ldquo;except as provided by <i>section 36(3)</i>&rdquo;. These circumstances are where moneys received in respect of redeemed assets comprise part of the cover assets pool. Until such time as they are used to purchase new assets, discharge claims or preferred creditors are removed from the pool because it is over-collateralised. Because these circumstances are dealt with by the reference to section 36(3), the second sentence of section 37 is superfluous and it is proposed to delete it. Furthermore, the sentence is incomplete as it does not refer to <Col N="339" /> the removal of moneys received in respect of redeemed assets from cover asset pools where such pools are over-collateralised.</P>

    <P>I accept the principle of Deputy McDowell's amendment. My officials tried to contact him yesterday to agree a period.

However, there may be occasions on which the appointment of a cover-assets monitor is required sooner.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of Committee Stage where it was suggested that the period in which proceedings could be brought in relation to an offence should be longer than two years. I think both Deputies McDowell and McGrath raised the issue. I agreed to look at extending the period on Report Stage and my officials have consulted the office of the Attorney General on the issue. The amendment proposes that for those offences under the Bill which may not be discovered immediately, prosecutions may be brought up to <Col N="342" /> two years after the Central Bank becomes aware of the offence. That more than covers the matter.</P>
    <P>For other offences which would be discovered immediately, such as failure of a financial institution to comply with a Central Bank directive, prosecutions must be brought within two years of the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed as originally provided for in the section. The amendment achieves a balance between not having prosecutions hanging over persons indefinitely and ensuring that those who have committed offences do not get away with them through successful concealment for a period of time. This very neatly meets the issues.</P>

      <P>In page 72, line 6, after &ldquo;both&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or on indictment to a fine of 20,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the lengthy debate we had towards the end of the Committee Stage proceedings in relation to the offences and the fines that can be levied by courts. The specific offences are set out in section 98 of the Bill and can be committed by virtually any of the players in terms of this Act, including the monitor or manager appointed in respect of a designated credit institution. The maximum fine or penalty provided for in the Bill is 1,900 or six months imprisonment on summary conviction.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to provide for the possibility of a conviction on indictment and I am suggesting a figure of 20,000 or five years imprisonment or both would be more appropriate. What we could be talking about, and we hope it never happens, is a significant measure of white collar crime where fraud, failure to disclose information or wrongdoing of a similar kind could be involved. It seems that in those circumstances, a maximum fine of 1,900 or six months imprisonment simply does not meet the measure of the crime that could be committed in terms of failure to comply with responsibilities imposed by this Act. I suggest that the Minister should provide for convictions on indictment and appropriate penalties to meet that.</P>

      <P>I was sympathetic to the point the Deputy made at Committee Stage and understood it and in my mind saw nothing wrong with it. However, following Committee Stage, I considered an amendment of the type proposed by the Deputy and my officials raised the issue with the Office of the Attorney General. Their view was that offences of the type set out in this section should be dealt with summarily and do not warrant being made into indictable offences. It should also be noted that if an offence under this section is serious and, for example, involves fraud, a separate criminal prosecution can be taken in respect of the fraud under other legislation, the point being that the Attorney Gen<Col N="343" /> eral's office wanted this offence as a summary offence, not an indictable offence, and did not want to go down that road as it is more than adequately covered by other legislation.</P>
      <P>Regarding sanctions generally, I would point out that section 96 of the Bill enables High Court orders to be obtained against persons who are contravening provisions of the Bill. Persons who did not comply with such an order would be in contempt of court and would face further sanctions in this regard. Having considered the matter, I am of the view that the penalties under the Bill are adequate in the context that I have set out.</P>

      <P>We have had similar difficulties in assessing how offences under the Companies Act should be dealt with by the courts because on the face of it those offences can be summary offences. They can appear to be relatively trivial or simply paperwork and it is extraordinarily difficult to prove that someone set out with the intention to defraud, which is what is necessary to get a conviction for fraud. One has a huge grey area where there is at the very least a suspicion that somebody deliberately turned a blind eye or did not complete paperwork, for example file company accounts in order to hide something. It seems that since it is becoming almost impossible to secure a conviction for fraud without the proof of intent there should at least be the capacity to impose heavier fines for non-compliance with the strict wording of the Companies Act and, for that matter, this Act. A fine of 1,900 in those circumstances strikes me as simply insufficient.</P>

      <P>I understand the point Deputy McDowell is making. As I explained, we consulted the Office of the Attorney General. Either fraud can be proven or it cannot be proven, irrespective of the Deputy's point. Clearly there is legislation in place that is more than adequate to deal with it in that context.</P>
      <P>Altering this section would have made it a different section. It would have been moving into an indictable area, which was not necessary as we already have strong fraud legislation which has recently been substantially enhanced. Instead the offence remains a summary offence. I am not dismissing the Deputy's point but I have gone as far as I can with it. I wish to keep this as it was intended originally in the Bill, not in an indictable sense. The reality is that if there is fraud it must be proven, no matter under which heading one tries to prove it.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we are not going to agree on this, but again I make the point that the function of the monitor is crucial to this Bill. If the monitor is not doing his or her business then the whole validity or solidity of the pool may not be guaranteed and the pool is certainly not being monitored in the way it should. The consequences, downstream, of a failure to comply <Col N="344" /> with the provisions of the Bill are quite considerable and could result in people losing money. We should emphasise that point with higher fines. I will push this at least to a voice vote.</P>

    <P>This Schedule amends the Building Societies Act, 1989, to facilitate building societies' investments in, and transfer of assets to, designated credit institutions. This will enable building societies to access the cheaper form of financing envisaged by this Bill and will make sure that they can continue to compete with other financial institutions. At the same time it is important to ensure that the rights of building society members continue to enjoy the same level of protection as they have done. Items 4 and 6 of this Part achieve this by amending sections 16 and 71 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, to specify that if a person's housing loan is transferred from a building society to a designated credit institution in which it has invested, that person, subject to the rules of the society, continues to be a member of the society.</P>
    <P>This is really an avoidance of doubt provision since the legislation is currently silent on such matters. Current practice is that building society members whose mortgages are transferred in more traditional securitisations continue to be treated as members of the building society. The remainder of the amendments allow building societies greater flexibility in funding, subject to the regulation of the Central Bank providing that building societies may invest in designated credit institutions and enabling them to transfer mortgages that they hold.</P>
    <P>The effect of these provisions is to create a framework in which building societies may use asset covered securities as a funding mechanism but in which the rights of members are copperfastened. It is vital that, for certainty, we copperfasten the rights of the members. To avoid any doubt we decided to rewrite the Schedule rather than trying to insert a load of amendments. I hope that meets with the Members' approval.</P>

It did strike me, and I know the Minister shares my view on this, that although it is on the face of it a very technical Bill, it is also potentially quite an important one and certainly quite important for players in the financial services sector. I compliment the Minister and his officials and those within the IBF and the Irish Mortgage and Savers' Association who took the initiative in bringing this to the Department.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy McGrath is vital. This provides for a new method of refinancing which will be of immediate interest to financial institutions. We hope, with good reason I hope, that within a relatively short time that will be demonstrated by way of longer fixed term mortgages which would be of benefit to mortgage holders. From the point of view of the consumer and the ordinary citizen, this is what we are primarily interested in.</P>

    <P>The thrust behind this amendment and my other amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 12, is an issue I raised on Committee Stage regarding the title of the Council of National Cultural Institutions. It should appear in its Irish form within the Bill. It is somewhat regrettable, given that this <Col N="349" /> is the Department with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, that the Opposition has to put down amendments like these. The Minister's amendment No. 2 is essentially the same as my amendment No. 1, while the situation is similar regarding amendment No. 14 in the name of the Minister and my amendment No. 12. I have no particular difficulty with the Minister's amendments but I was advised that in terms of the Irish title of the CNCI, it would be more proper to have the Irish version appear earlier and I would like to hear the Minister's response to that. I am pleased she has accepted the essence of the point I raised on Committee Stage and there are only technicalities between us at the moment.

At this stage, subject to the advice of parliamentary counsel, I am pleased to accept the substance of the amendments put forward by Deputies O'Shea and McGinley. Counsel has now drafted the appropriate amendments. Regarding Deputy McGinley's amendment, while I appreciate his genuine concerns regarding an Irish title that facilitates easy pronunciation and recollection, Deputies will see that parliamentary counsel has advised that the appropriate Irish translation of the CNCI is An Chomhairle um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept these amendments as they seek to increase the number of institutions which would draw upon the resources of the heritage fund as well as expanding the Council of National Cultural Institutions beyond that of our national institutions. The net effect of such amendments would be the dilution of the beneficial effect of the fund and they would mitigate against the successful acquisition of important works of national heritage for the national collecting cultural institutions; the country would not be in a better position to acquire significant artefacts.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that the purpose of the heritage fund is to build up resources which will be available to the principal State collecting cultural institutions in order for them to acquire critically important items of movable heritage. These items or artefacts must be outstanding examples of their type and pre-eminent in their class. Such artefacts will be of a type that their loss to the nation would represent a significant deficiency in our national heritage collection to be handed on to future generations. The fund is not meant to be a general disbursement fund but one of safeguarding Ireland's significant heritage objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware that section 2 provides a list of five eligible institutions which will benefit from the fund and these are Ireland's principal collecting national institutions and are the National Archives, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Members will note that not all of the Council of National Cultural Institutions are eligible institutions under this Bill. The beneficiary institutions are only those principal collecting national institutions. Accordingly I cannot agree with the principle to weaken the effects of the Bill and to provide that the general county councils of Ireland or any other agency nominate three additional directors or chief <Col N="351" /> executives to the CNCI. It must be remembered that the function being conferred by statute on the CNCI is but one of its functions. It would be totally inappropriate therefore to have anybody other than the directors or chief executives of the national cultural institutions represented on the body. The CNCI by its very definition is confined, and properly so, to the directors or chief executives of the following national institutions: the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Concert Hall, the Chester Beatty Library, the National Theatre Society Limited and the National Archives. To attempt to expand the eligible institutions beyond those listed would negate the focused intention behind the Bill and I therefore cannot support amendments Nos. 3 and 15.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I missed the first part of the Minister's contribution on these amendments.</P>
      <P>We had a fairly extensive discussion of this on Committee Stage and I felt strongly about it on Second Stage also. We decided to table the amendments again on Report Stage. The points I made on Second Stage and on Committee Stage are still relevant. While I welcome the Bill and the general principle of the fund, which should help us to maintain our heritage, its main weakness is that heritage matters will remain centralised in Dublin. The institutions that will benefit from the fund are based mainly in the capital and board members are nominated by institutions based there. It is obvious the Minister has considered this amendment, but I do not think her reaction is more positive now than it was on Second and Committee Stages. She said on Committee Stage that there would be a lending programme for designated museums and galleries throughout the country. If my amendment is not accepted, the lending programme should be vigorously pursued, at least. People should be able to go to a museum near them to view items of heritage discovered in their locality. I will not press this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 32, after &ldquo;£3,000,000&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(3,809,214)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 10, 11 and 17 relate to the euro, which will be introduced on 1 January 2002. Members will note that amendments Nos. 6, 8, and 10 deal with the amounts to be invested in the fund over the five year period. Amendment No. 11 deals with the minimum amount to be paid from the fund for a single artefact. Amendment No. 17 converts the fine for an offence under sections 11 and 12 of the Bill to its euro equivalent. As I stated on Committee Stage, I sought advice from the Chief Parliamentary Counsel regarding the euro. I am pleased to be able to accept the substance of Deputy O'Shea's amendments. The amendments I propose differ slightly from those of Deputy O'Shea, on the advice of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, on whose advice I have also put forward amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 17.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the substance of the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage in relation to the euro. References in the Bill to the pound, which ceases to be legal tender next year, caused me some concern. I have no problem with the Minister's amendments, but perhaps the Minister will clarify why reference to the pound equivalent is being retained along with the euro figure in brackets. On the basis that the euro will be legal tender when moneys are paid to the heritage fund after 1 January 2002, why is it necessary to retain reference to the pound?</P>

      <P>Molaim an leasú seo, go mbeadh obair na comhairle tré mheán na Gaeilge nó an Bhéarla. Leasú an-réasúnta é seo.

Go speisialta, ó táimid ag plé chúrsaí oidhreachta agus cultúrtha, is cóir go mbeadh áit lárnach ag an teanga in imeachtaí na comhairle. Ní barraíocht a iarraidh go bhféadfaí an obair a dhéanamh i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla. Nílimid ag cur brú ar éinne Béarla ná Gaeilge a úsáid. Má tá fonn ar éinne an Ghaeilge nó an Béarla a úsáid, táimid ag moladh go mbeadh cead aige nó aici é sin a dhéanamh agus go mbeadh sé sin ins an Acht. Is cóir go mbeadh sé de cheart ag an gcoiste a chuid oibre a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge nó tré Bhéarla.</P>
      <P>I láthair na huaire tá an Bille teanga á ullmhú, Bille atá geallta le ceithre bliana. Deirtear linn anois go mbeidh an Bille ar fáil i dtosach na bliana seo chugainn. Ní cóir dúinn fanacht go dtiocfaidh an Bill teanga fá choinne a háit féin a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Is féidir linn tosú anois. Molaim an leasú seo.</P>
      <P>We discussed this amendment extensively on Committee Stage. We merely ask that meetings of the council may be conducted through the medium of the Irish or English language. We do not say meetings must be conducted through the medium of any one language. That will be entirely the choice of those participating in the meetings.</P>
      <P>We are on the threshold of introducing the language Bill but we should not have to wait for the enactment of that legislation to give proper recognition to Irish, the first official language. It is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will give it further consideration.</P>
      <P>The language is an important part of our cultural heritage and this is a heritage Bill. We must be positive in our use of the language. The amendment does not compel anyone to use it but it provides that their right to do so is recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It may not be necessary in a strict legal sense. According to the explanatory memorandum the Bill is poverty proofed and it points out that no adverse implications arise in that respect. It also refers to <Col N="357" /> the impact of the legislation on north-south and east-west relations and on rural communities.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that Bille na Gaeilge will be published early next year and it is expected to provide that all legislation will be Irish language proofed as it is drafted. The more often it is stated that the Irish language could, should, must or may be used the more likely it is that the concept will be planted in the minds of people. This will have a positive effect in terms of their attitude towards using the language.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley has pointed out that the amendment does not seek to compel, as the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; indicates. On Committee Stage, I made it clear that the Irish language should not be used in any context as a stick with which to beat or embarrass people because they do not understand or cannot speak the language. The amendment seeks to help create a climate that would encourage them to be more positive in using it at meetings. In this regard consideration should be given to the provision of a translation system for meetings of An Chomhairle um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta. It would enable those who are not proficient in the language to participate.</P>
      <P>People should be encouraged to use the Irish language. We do not know the detail of Bille na Gaeilge and I accept the Minister is not in a position to divulge its contents. However, if it is to have an effective meaning in terms of legislation, Irish language proofing must be part of the procedure in the preparation of all legislation from here on.</P>
      <P>We do not seek to create conflict on this issue because the greater the co-operation throughout the House regarding the promotion of the Irish language the better it will be for all. In this spirit I look forward to the Minister's reply. Since Committee Stage she has had the opportunity to reflect further on this amendment. I ask her not to take an exclusively legalistic approach and I accept what she said on Committee Stage that there is nothing to prevent meetings of the council being held in the Irish language. However, acceptance of this amendment would have a positive effect in terms of encouraging those involved in the council and in interpreting the legislation to focus on using the Irish language in the conduct of the affairs of agencies of whatever kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>I thank both Deputies for their contribution to this issue. We had a long debate on Committee Stage and they will recall I was well disposed to the sentiment of the amendments that were moved then. I accept that the concern is not with compulsion but opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is an opportunity for those involved in the council to discuss matters on the agenda of meetings in Irish or in English or in both languages. There is nothing to prevent them from doing that. However, in view of the debate, I again sought the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Amendment No. 16 seeks to legislate in detail the conduct of the CNCI meetings. As I stated on Committee Stage, this is a matter for the members of the council who are wise and experienced individuals and we should allow them to agree to the conduct of their meetings and procedures as stipulated under section 10. I am conscious of the positive approach taken by the Deputies towards the Bill and I have attempted to be as sympathetic as possible to their views. The Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the amendment is not appropriate and that it is unnecessary and superfluous. In the circumstances, my legal advice is strong and despite some regard for the purpose of the amendment, I cannot accept it. I oppose it in view of the technical legal reasons put to me by the Parliamentary Counsel. I must take cognisance of its advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position regarding members of the council who are native Irish speakers? Will they be unable to make their contribution in their native language? Will they have to revert to their second language, which is English? Does the Minister not agree that this would create an element of discrimination? The absence of a facility to conduct meetings in both languages would probably militate more against the Irish rather than English speakers.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department is responsible for the promotion of the language. She is an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán. The language plays a very important role in her Department. When I first became a Member of this House some years ago the Department conducted its affairs entirely in Irish. Any time one consulted the Department one was sure that Irish was the predominant language and often the only language in use. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>I know there are reasons for that. We do not favour compulsion any more, but we are all in favour of a voluntary effort. There has been a downgrading of Irish throughout the Department and that cannot be denied by the Minister or anybody else as I have experienced it myself. I hope the Minister is aware of her responsibility towards the language in spite of the advice received by the Minister. As Deputy O'Shea said, I do not think there is language proofing. If the Bill was introduced next year I suppose my amendment would have been included in light of Bille na Gaeilge which we expect to be passed in the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has had strong legal advice on this issue and will not change her position. When the council is in place, will the Minister notify it that it is possible for it to conduct meetings through Irish or English? Perhaps she will also examine the provision of a translation service to facilitate the use of Irish at such meetings. I ask her to notify this possibility to other boards within her remit and to seek the support of her colleagues in Government regard<Col N="359" /> ing boards under their jurisdiction so they are advised that they can conduct business through Irish or English. I also ask that they be asked to explore the issue of translation facilities. If what I am suggesting was pursued by the Minister it would be a significant step forward. It would be no more than notifying people there is nothing preventing them from holding meetings through Irish if they so desire. We need to go a step further in terms of providing translation services. If a number of boards required such a service, the State could examine putting a translation service in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with the sentiments expressed by both Deputies. I wish to reiterate the voluntary effort in this context. Any body can conduct its business in Irish or English, or both, depending on what they wish. The CNCI will be well aware that it can conduct its business through Irish if that is the wish of its members. If the CNCI decides to conduct its affairs through Irish and requires translation facilities, I would have no problem ensuring funding for such translation is put in place. As the Deputies said, we are here to encourage the Irish language which is a very important part of our heritage. I cannot accept the amendment because of legal technicalities of which I have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel. However, there is no question of discriminating against those who wish to speak the first national language, as is their constitutional right.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 10, after &ldquo;matters&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in this regard to co-operate with other public authorities in providing information to assist persons in balancing their work and family responsibilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 4(1)(<i>d</i>). Deputy Broughan raised this amendment on Committee Stage. At the time I pointed out that policy responsibility for this issue falls within the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Employment Equality Agency and the social partners also have responsibilities or commitments under the PPF which are relevant to this issue. I agree there is an important role for the family support agency in working in co-operation with the key interests in the field in promoting information directly to families and their local communities about the developments in family friendly working arrangements and the options which might be available to better support parents in balancing work and family commitments. The amendment I am proposing is designed to expand the information function being given to the agency in section 4(1)(<i>d</i>) to include information to assist families in balancing their work and family responsibilities. The role of the family support agency in promoting awareness of the importance of this issue for families will be further strengthened by the potential for it to undertake research on this as provided for in section 4(1)(<i>f</i>).</P>

In relation to the amendments before us, the Minister has gone some of the way to meet the concerns of the Labour Party in relation to section 4 on the functions of the agency. We regarded it as a key function of the agency to address the issue of family-unfriendly work practices. In the recent era of the Celtic tiger, we have had a more cut-throat economy, particularly in areas of services where people are expected to work on contract and, very often, under fairly bad conditions. Shift work, night work and weekend work has come to be expected rather than, as in the past, being governed by reasonably good labour protection legislation. Also, some 48% to 50% of women are engaged in the workforce and that figure is increasing. The area of caring duties, both for men and women, must be highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the two amendments before us is that, in the Labour Party amendment, we include the role of advocacy. The primary function of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is concerned with job creation, replacement jobs, liaison with FÁS and competition in the economy, including issues relating to the introduction of the euro. The agency needs a stronger role. In the latest issue of Family Friendly News, which is circulated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, there seems to be a striking dichotomy between two surveys which were carried out. An IBEC survey indicated that, in the manufacturing and wholesale areas, some 73% of companies have flexible and family-friendly working arrangements. The figure for the financial services sector was 64% and 73% for the retail sector. However, from the perspective of employees in manufacturing and wholesale, the number of employees with flexible work arrangements was only 9.5%, in financial services it was only 19% and in retail only 27%. There is a huge gap between the number of companies which say they provide family-friendly facilities to workers and the number of workers who can actually avail of this. The number of workers in permanent part-time employment is only 2.2% and only 0.5% of workers have real job sharing arrangements, according to the IBEC survey. Only 4% of workers are on flexitime, the number on career breaks is 0.2% and the number with flexible hours is 1.4%. Those are the most up to date figures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. There is an <Col N="362" /> issue in that regard in terms of family life being greatly disrupted. As we try to become one of the wealthier countries of the European Union, people are expected to work all hours of the clock. In this House, we should bow our heads in shame in relation to the hours we demand of ourselves and our staff who are on duty now and will still be here later tonight until, perhaps, 12 midnight. Some other parliaments, such as the Swedish parliament, have tried to bring in fundamental reforms of this antediluvian system. Parliaments which have approximately equal proportions of men and women have had some success in operating a nine to five arrangement. The Minister may say that, in our own arena, we have the possibility, after Christmas, of more normal and coherent working hours for public representatives and for the staff who provide such strong support.</P>
    <P>The dissemination of information would be a very appropriate role for the Family Support Agency. The figures I have quoted would normally reach only a small number of people, perhaps professionals and public representatives, but they should be made known more widely. I accept the Minister has come some way in this regard and I know he has been reluctant to accept amendments, particularly on the Social Welfare Bill. I hope the Labour Party and Fine Gael will not have attempt to amend that entire Bill when it arrives in a few weeks' time. However, on this Bill, I ask the Minister to give further consideration to giving the Family Support Agency an advocacy role. In other words, the agency should be in a position to chase Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment people who have a different brief &ndash; their brief is to keep this country moving and, in general terms, they do that very successfully and the Department has some brilliant officials. I believe the Family Support Agency will see a need for a role in balancing work and family responsibilities. I thank the Minister for moving as far as he has done and I ask him to go the whole mile by accepting the Labour Party amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Family Support Agency Bill which puts down an important marker in providing services to families who are facing crisis. It brings together a number of different strands, including the work of the community resource centres, the family mediation services and the counselling services currently available to families. We will now have an agency with an umbrella over these groups, promoting and supporting their work. Families are under a variety of pressures &ndash; social, economic and psychological &ndash; and people need to know where to go for help. I hope this agency will reach out to communities and that, through the developing resource network around the country, people will be more aware of the work of the agency and the family mediation service. On Committee Stage, I raised the issue of the pressures on families in relation to the tragic deaths of 16 young children <Col N="363" /> in the past 20 months. The Minister said he hoped the Family Support Agency would undertake research on this issue and identify the pressures on families where matters deteriorate so dramatically and so tragically. That area should be examined by the Agency with a view to bringing forward recommendations and taking new policy initiatives. I commend the Minister's announcement in that regard during Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment before us, I am glad the Minister has agreed to put an obligation on the Family Support Agency to provide information to families about balancing work and family responsibilities. Perhaps there is, unfortunately, less information for people in this country than in other countries about the supports available to them in this area. We have been behind our European counterparts in relation to making it easy for men and women to combine work and family responsibilities. It is a phrase which trips easily off the tongue but it hides a multitude of pressures, demands, struggles, difficulties and challenges that families face in combining work and family responsibilities &ndash; and ever more so since we have more women working outside the home. It is a very big issue for everyone.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Broughan that the Agency should have a role in providing information, although I would prefer if it involved more than just giving information. However, information is very important and it will be a way of empowering people by providing information on the different options and choices in relation to job sharing, part-time work and so on. It is important to have a place where people can discuss these issues. Women, in particular, can feel isolated when faced with decisions of this kind and it can be difficult to get the required response from employers. Very often it means a drop in income for women also. It is interesting that it is mainly women who avail of these part-time options.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>A steering group was established in July 1997 to examine the basic income concept in fulfilment of a commitment made in Partnership 2000. Its role was to oversee a study which would take into account the work of the ESRI, CORI, the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare and international research on the implications of introducing a basic income system.</P>
      <P>The group was comprised of representatives of all four pillars of social partnership as well as relevant Departments including the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs. The group met on ten occasions and its report was published in March 2001. Copies have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It was not the role of the group to reach a conclusion or make recommendations about a specific detailed model of a basic income system. However, the work undertaken has advanced our understanding of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on basic income. The Green Paper will build on the report of the working group. My Department is currently preparing proposals in this regard and I hope to be in a position to publish a Green Paper early in the new Dáil session.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh freagra an Taoisigh ar an ábhar seo uair amháin eile. The issue of the guaranteed basic income and the date of the publication of the Green Paper has been raised in the House previously. It is now nine months since the report the Taoiseach referred to was issued. Can the Taoiseach explain why there has been a delay of nine months so far in the date of publication of the Green Paper? When does he foresee that it will be published? Will we be forced to ask the same question again or can the Taoiseach give us a definite publication date?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Sargent has repeatedly raised this issue through the various stages. I hoped to have it ready for Christmas. We have an individual working full-time to pull this together. I am told it will take about a month longer than that. It is complex enough just to get all the aspects gathered and to produce a Green Paper which will take into account all the work done in the past. The ESRI undertook phase one of the study. Professor Charles Clarke of John's University contributed. Phase two was undertaken by the ESRI led consortium. The official concerned is trying to get all the considerations and all the aspects into the Green Paper. There is no delay other than the delay of trying to get it together for presentation. I checked this last night. I am told it will tale until the end of January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that as a first step towards the establishment of basic <Col N="365" /> income policy in this country the Government should now accept the recommendation of the PPF group on benchmarking? This group has recommended that by the year 2007, the lowest rate of social welfare should represent 27% of gross average industrial earnings.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that there is now a deliberate policy at the heart of the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to scupper that report as both Ministers refuse to accept the recommendation of a limited benchmark of 27% by the year 2007.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has signed up to the recommendation. Will the Taoiseach give an indication to the House of his own personal view in respect of the commitment that has been made to the PPF in this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>&mdash;as a date for publication. It is in the programme for government so I assume he knows what he is talking about when he says that. Is the Taoiseach going to look at the response of the Dutch Government which has taken on the guaranteed basic income idea in its response to dealing with the downturn in the aviation industry as it affects KLM? They have put in place a payment to the workers who are availing of that shorter working week. In the spirit of implementing the guaranteed basic income, may I ask him to look at the implementation of that type of idea in relation to people in this country affected by the downturn in the aviation industry? Has he given any further thought to the implementation of the guaranteed basic income idea in the light of that example from another EU member state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The study included an examination of the concepts and practice in other countries. The working group was established arising from the commitment in Partnership 2000 to examine basic income. That working group did not give any specific model on basic income but rather outlined the implications of a basic income approach. The John's University study looked at all areas and examined many methods. One of <Col N="366" /> the advantages of the Green Paper is to detail and facilitate a discussion on all those concepts and ideas. A range of issues, including taxes, direct and indirect, and other concepts, was examined. It is difficult to give a fair presentation when pulling all that together It is not a case of trying to bury the concept but of examining what is involved. It is a complex matter and I am sure Deputy Sargent will agree, the likely effects of introducing a basic income system have to be evaluated in detail and that is what we are doing in a comprehensive Green Paper.</P>
      <P>No other country that was tracked in the studies has introduced a basic income. The issue may have been addressed in part by income adequacy, minimum pay or other such methods but the lack of an example has presented a problem for those working on this issue, including the social partners. They are working on something new and I am sure the Deputy would agree it will take some time to develop a Green Paper, but it is still worth the effort.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable input from a large number of people and bodies from within and outside Government, such as the ESRI, CORI and the social partners, in examining this issue. Members of this House have spent much time examining the advantages and disadvantages of introducing a basic income. There are disadvantages but there are also advantages and they have to be weighed up in the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that while income is a very important component of living standards for persons who live below the poverty line, State services are equally important? If that is the case, how can he justify the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children today that the extension of limits for medical cards is to be deferred to 2003? The package of income plus services is what makes up living standards and that is particularly true for the poorest in our society, 20% of whom continue to live below the poverty line on £126 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the Green Paper. In the last number of years, not alone has the Government given medical cards to everybody over 70 years of age, which is a very socially progressive measure, but it has also doubled the income threshold in the last three budgets to cater for people on low incomes. That has been very beneficial. In question this year is if the Minister is putting his resources into other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is the usual practice, the agenda for the Laeken European Council will not be finalised until shortly before the meeting. However, at the European Council in Nice, Heads of State or Government agreed that the European Council in Laeken would initiate a formal process of wider and deeper debate about the future of the <Col N="368" /> European Union. A key item to be discussed at the Laeken Council will therefore be the future of Europe debate. The European Council is likely to agree the text of a declaration which will set out the terms of reference of the future of Europe debate, and will establish the arrangements for a convention to carry the process forward in advance of the next intergovernmental conference. It is also expected the Council will consider issues arising from the events of 11 September and the enlargement process.</P>
    <P>Our priorities for the Laeken European Council will be to ensure the declaration, which leaders will agree at the Council, provides a solid basis for the convention that is to carry forward the future of Europe debate into 2003. Ireland will work to ensure the convention is structured so as to take account of the concerns of all European citizens. We also wish to send a clear signal to the world, that the EU is serious about addressing the threats posed by terrorism, and that we intend to implement in full, the justice and home affairs milestones, agreed at the Tampere Council in 1999. Another priority will be to send a clear message to the candidate countries, that both the EU, and Ireland in particular, remain fully committed to the enlargement process, and that we look forward to welcoming new member states into the Union from 2004.</P>
    <P>I will meet Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium on 6 December to discuss the preparations for the Council. At this stage I have made no plans for bilateral meetings at Laeken. However, we will keep this matter under constant review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the meeting of a number of European leaders convened by Prime Minister Blair in London on 4 November, I understand the meeting was primarily called to discuss the military involvement of certain member states in the current situation in Afghanistan. I did not receive an invitation to attend this meeting. This meeting could not be considered a meeting of the European Union, as it was not convened under the chairmanship of the EU Presidency and was not attended by all 15 member states of the Union.</P>
    <P>Individual member states are free to meet informally, on a bilateral basis, or from time to time in smaller groups, to discuss matters common to themselves, or to agree a certain course of action within the parameters of normal EU business. However, such meetings cannot in any way commit the EU to a specific course of action, nor can the views expressed at such meetings be considered representative of the wider EU membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Laeken summit, the Taoiseach outlined that defence matters would be addressed as a result of the events of 11 September. Will the defence of installations such as Sellafield be raised by him, in particular following the revelations in <i>The Observer</i> which indicated that security there was perhaps being compromised owing to the links between the <Col N="369" /> major investor in security there and the war on terrorism, as it is called, in regard to Afghanistan? I also raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning. It would be worth following up these reports before the Taoiseach goes to Laeken.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach note the observations by a retired senior army officer, and myself and others who visited Sellafield recently, on the lack of defence security so that matter can be raised at Laeken?</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of a European constitution in the Laeken declaration, will the Taoiseach elaborate on how the issue of an EU constitution was included in that declaration, given that it did not seem to figure in the 19 November meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers? Perhaps it arose through a bilateral summit between France and Germany on 23 November. If the Taoiseach proposes to deal with this matter, as I assume he will at Laeken, will he be objecting to this part of the declaration and, if not, will he address how the constitution could relate to any possible future EU constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the opportunity of raising the first matter with Prime Minister Blair when we meet on Friday and if necessary at any other forum.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the convention, as the Deputy knows, arising from the completion of the work early last year on the Charter of Fundamental Rights there was a debate within that working group prior to its completion of the charter as to whether it should have a legal basis or whether it was a list of rights, directives and policies of the EU. That was not progressed at that stage because it could not take legal effect. Debate centred on the question of issues within the charter being challenged and that the European Court of Justice would say this was in the charter but it did not have legal effect. A number of countries indicated that this matter should be revisited. There was much discussion at the time but no great agreement on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has answered the question regarding where the issue arose in more recent times. The press release by the Belgian Presidency stated it supported a French and German proposal to develop a European Constitution. The charter is one of the items of discussion at the next Intergovernmental Conference and I have nothing to add to the press release. It states: &ldquo;The future of Europe debate is at an early stage and it is inevitable that in any such debate it is natural for a wide range of ideas to be floated&rdquo;. Many are being floated day in, day out and decisions on the charter and the other issues are not likely to be taken until the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. Europe already has a constitution in the form of the treaties. They are the legal base under which all of us live and work.</P>

      <P>No, but the Union's constitution is in the form of the treaties because they govern it. They have been considered to be the constitution for years. That is not what some member state are now saying. They say they would deal with it in another format. This issue will go on for the next three years because many people believe the Community should have a constitution.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe Ireland's failure to ratify the Nice Treaty will weaken his negotiating position at Laeken? When the issue of enlargement and the ratification of the Nice Treaty is raised by other heads of government with him, what programme for ratification does he intend to outline to his colleagues at Laeken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme I outlined at Goteborg still stands so there will not be new discussion on that. That is still the programme we are following and I will outline the progress we have made on that issue. A number of individuals from different areas of the Commission and other countries have been or will be in Ireland and they will assist us in participating in that. I welcome that and I will ask for their co-operation on these issues over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other issue, our position is not affected at this stage because other countries know that we must deal with it. However, the four issues that were set out at Nice will be discussed at Laeken and they will be extended, although they will not be the only issues raised at Laeken. The four issues are the limitation of powers between the Union and member states; the charter of fundamental rights; the simplification of the treaties; and the role of Parliaments in the European structure. A number of European colleagues, both Heads of State and, in particular, Ministers <Col N="371" /> for Foreign Affairs, who have had a number of meetings to debate the report that will be sent to Laeken, have raised other issues which they want to form the debate at the intergovernmental conference over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The debate will be more detailed than that about which people were talking a year ago. That is inevitable. The items that will be finally agreed at Laeken to be discussed at a broader intergovernmental conference over the next few years are the subject of speculation at this stage and they will probably not be fixed at Laeken. The Laeken Summit will decide the structure, composition and formats for progressing the debate between 2002 and 2003. There will then be a firebreak period before the intergovernmental conference commences in 2004.</P>

      <P>Order, please. The Deputies are being disorderly. Deputy Quinn should proceed with his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government a position going into the Laeken Summit regarding the structure of the debate? Does the Government agree it should contain a brief analysis of the issues involved, including the question of re-writing the treaties to put them into a coherent constitutional framework? Most people agree that if one was to read all the treaties from cover to cover, one would not have the slightest idea as to the full and total powers of the EU and the European Community and there is a need for clarity in regard to the legal basis of the Union. That is normally described as a constitution and an EU constitution is clearly on the agenda. Whether it is to be a federal Europe, a federation of nation-states, a post-federal Europe or a confederation is a matter to be resolved down the road.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree, as the EU faces enlargement to up to 25 member states, there is a need for a constitution along the lines I have outlined without putting a label on what the nature of the state will be? Does he believe the fundamental charter of human rights should be incorporated in that constitution and the fundamental rights encapsulated in the constitutions of existing and future member states should be brought into line with the charter in a manner not dissimilar to the way the European Court functions in relation to our Constitution at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second set of questions relates to the composition of the convention, which will be the negotiating body that will lead to the intergovernmental conference and, ultimately, to a treaty in 2004. during which year Ireland will hold the EU Presidency. What will be the nature of Ireland's representation at the convention? Each member state will be represented and I take that to mean <Col N="373" /> the Government will nominate a person. National Parliaments will be represented by two persons. I want an undertaking from the Taoiseach that the three main parties in the House will be represented, unlike the previous convention on the fundamental charter on human rights from which the Labour Party was excluded. Does he agree the Government nominee should represent the Fianna Fáil Party and the Parliament should nominate two representatives from the two largest parties to maximise democratic representation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What action will the Government take in Laeken with regard to the unilateral action by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in calling a meeting and summoning to London a number of Heads of State and Heads of Government having a representative of the European Union at it, to wit Javier Solana? Will the Taoiseach raise on behalf of small member states generally, the practice and precedent whereby if a large member state or any group of member states wishes to have a special meeting of interested European states to discuss an issue of immense concern &ndash; the war in Afghanistan is undoubtedly that &ndash; there is a clear precedent for that, and it is to use the existing Presidency? It happened during the time of the collapse of the Berlin Wall when there was an extra meeting convened by the Presidency here. Members will recall that in the spring of 1990 the Irish Presidency responded to a call from President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl and a proper communitaire meeting took place at which all member states were present. Did Ambassador Anderson at COREPER act unilaterally or did she speak formally and officially on behalf of the Irish Government when expressing concern at the nature of the non-communitaire meeting? Will the Taoiseach agree it is a bad practice to be tolerated where large groups of member states acting in a quasi-director form can ride roughshod over the institutions of the Union in general, particularly the interests of small member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has asked three sets of questions to which I will give three sets of answers. The Deputy has raised two of four issues that came out of the Nice European council that will form the basis of discussion. First was the delimitation of powers and, second was the status of the charter of fundamental rights. I explained in reply to Deputy Sargent that we need to take that from where it was left at that stage, where it was a document which was completed by the convention, and take it forward. There would be constitutional difficulties for a number of countries if it was left in the form it was in. The <Col N="374" /> Deputy asked what if it was done in such a way that it adhered to the European Court of Justice and I agree that is the way it should proceed. In that way it could be more easily supported by people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Irish Government support that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we did so at the convention. The position was articulated by Deputy O'Kennedy who spent an enormous amount of time dealing with the issue that if it was just taken as a charter, it would not be linked with European constitutions or the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>On the simplification of the treaties, I agree that the treaties have evolved and developed and have been extended into so many areas that there is an enormous amount of work to be done to arrange the treaties, whether in blocks, in terms of rights, obligations or whatever. However, there is agreement that the debate will be about the simplification of the treaties. The Irish Government agrees with that but, needless to say, there will be a debate on how it can best be done. Deputy Quinn is familiar with some of the argument in regard to what blocks are put with what and how they are treated in the future. I have an open mind on how this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Irish Government support it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, put forward views in the preliminary discussions. We do not have just one stated position. We have said we agree with the simplification of the treaties. The Minister supports putting together the constitutional rights as against a great deal of the detail which is now built into the treaties. That would make the treaties far simpler, more readable and more manageable. The Deputy is aware of the role of national parliaments in the European architecture.</P>
      <P>On the composition of the convention, there is general agreement that the convention should be comprised of representatives of member state governments, national parliaments, European parliaments, the Commission and that applicant countries should be fully involved with the process. The Irish Government supports that position. It has not been defined precisely how applicant countries could do that. The exact details of the convention, which is going through the General Affairs Council, is still being debated, but that is the general position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of parliamentarians, it is currently envisaged that each member state will nominate two national parliamentarians. It is too early to say how they will be nominated but clearly the two members could not be from the <Col N="375" /> Government side. The Deputy asked could there be more nominees.</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach responds, I would point out that Members should not interrupt when the Taoiseach or anyone else is speaking, for two reasons. First, it is disorderly and, second, the microphone is not live and Members may subsequently wonder why the word &ldquo;interruptions&rdquo; is included in the report, as was raised yesterday during the course of the debate. Members should be clear that it is far better to wait until the Chair gives them the floor.</P>

      <Col N="376" /> The agenda of the meeting, had it been organised in a way which would have been satisfactory to everyone, related to the military actions and that is what should have been discussed. Unfortunately, other issues were discussed, which should not have been. With a number of other countries, we participated in a formal protest on the issue the following day to the Presidency and to the President of the Commission. It was the formal position of the Government that Ambassador Anderson put forward.</P>

Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Franco-German statement took no account of the decision of the people in this State to reject the Nice Treaty? Will he avail of the opportunity at Laeken to formally request that the other member states not proceed with the ratification of the Nice treaty because, unless all EU states are agreed, none are agreed? Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity at Laeken to raise the continuing crisis in the aviation industry and the dire need for State aid for national airlines, especially Aer Lingus?</P>

      <P>The debate on the future of Europe has gone on, in one form or another, since last year. Various countries, Ministers and political parties within countries have made many suggestions on numerous items and that will continue before and after the Laeken summit. There is nothing anyone can do about that and I do not think we should be overly concerned with people floating ideas. In some countries different government parties have floated very different ideas. The French and Germans have laid out a number of different positions on different issues, as they are entitled to do, but it will be a negotiated process. I have already given the items that have been agreed. I have told Deputy Noonan that many other items will be on the agenda and not just in four categories. A far more extensive debate will go on between now and 2003 and into the intergovernmental conference of 2004.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has put forward many ideas and suggestions for the debate at Laeken. It would not be helpful to start taking up positions and getting into arguments about every speech that is made. Recently five different speeches were made in four different countries in the course of one day. We must participate fully in the best way we can from Government, Parliament and official level. That is the obligation we must undertake and the process we must be involved in over the next two years.</P>

If this Government is to give any leadership on this issue the proper course of action is to set out a programme of action as to what it feels is necessary to ensure the Treaty of Nice, when it is put before the people again, is ratified.</P>

      <P>I agree that if we are not to ratify the treaty then we would be likely to be on our own. I do not see any difficulties in other countries. The ratification of the Treaty of Nice is essential for the process of enlargement to happen. That will then require us to go through a number of stages of development, which I outlined at Gothenburg and has the support of the European Council and the vast majority of this House. We have to follow our procedures and look at the issues that are important to us. All of those things are going on in the Committee on European Affairs and being looked at by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, me and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a democracy and unfortunately, or <Col N="378" /> fortunately &ndash; it depends on how one looks at it &ndash; when the Nice treaty was presented to the people in a referendum the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side, which I was on, was defeated.</P>

In view of the fact that most EU states have supported the military action in Afghanistan, will the Taoiseach raise for discussion the re-evaluation of this support in view of the utter disregard for the Geneva Convention and the massacre of prisoners on a daily basis?

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's previous reply in relation to the informal meeting in London, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already stated that he does not understand the basis on which Javier Solana attended the meeting given that his position is co-ordinator of European foreign policy. I have a straight question. Will Javier Solana be making a report to the European Council clarifying the basis for his attendance at the meeting? Does the Taoiseach further agree that co-ordination of European foreign policy at European Union level has been seriously compromised by the attendance of Mr. Solana at this meeting, which apparently has no status and does not have the general support of members of the Union?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the 1998 AEV was being published in November 1997 I decided that the summary tables should include information on the forecast outturn for 1997. I regarded this as a useful innovation which would enable the proposed allocations for 1998 to be compared with expected expenditure in 1997. I <Col N="382" /> continued this practice in each of the subsequent three years. However, I decided it would not be appropriate to adopt the same approach this year because I had not had the opportunity when the 2002 AEV was being finalised to deal with the emerging pressures for additional spending across a number of Votes. Instead I adopted the practice, which had been in operation prior to 1997, of including the 2001 Estimate figure as approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure is published by my Department on the weekend before the budget. The White Paper will be published at the usual time again this year and will, as usual, include the forecast outturn of expenditure for 2001, the pre-budget estimated expenditure in 2002, both voted and non-voted, and Estimates of receipts from taxation in 2002 at pre-budget.</P>
      <P>The following table shows the forecast 2001 outturn figures for current and capital expenditure by Vote. These figures reflect the intention to seek Dáil approval for Supplementary Estimates on a number of Votes. The figures may of course be subject to slight revision in light of emerging spending trends.</P>
      <P>The total forecast outturn for net voted current expenditure in 2001 is 20,653,734. The total forecast outturn for net voted capital expenditure is 4,947,276. A breakdown of the forecast outturn for 2001 by subhead is not available at this stage in the year. This information will be provided, as usual, in the 2002 Revised Estimates for Public Services which will be published in the spring.</P>

    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell: Will the Minister explain why he left this column out of this year's Estimates? Was he not trying to hide something? Was he not admitting in the other sentence he used, about ongoing pressures for additional expenditure, that the Book of Estimates he published was not the real Book of Estimates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, I introduced the innovation in my first published Estimates volume in November 1997 of publishing the forecast outturn. Until then the only figures that appeared in the AEV was the Estimate approved many months previously. It took no account of revised Estimates that would possibly have been passed and what Supplementaries would be introduced. I took what I thought was an innovative step of publishing what I thought the forecast outturn was going to be. I introduced that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can have it in the figures available now but the reason for not doing so is that I wanted the best information available. It was impossible before the AEV to sign off with a number of Departments on what they expected their supplementary demands would be. Supplementary Estimates were put before the House in the last two days which must go to committee and be debated. It was not possible with a number of headings to decide what the outturn would be, particularly with regard to some of the major spending Departments. That was the only reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is funny that the Minister can give figures this week when he could not give them last week. Was he not in fact trying to mislead the media into a false assessment of next year's Estimates? Will he tell us what additional expenditure has now been agreed between his press conference on the Book of Estimates and now that were not included in the Book of Estimates?</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested that the Estimates for 2002 are in doubt. The Estimates for 2002 are those I provided in the AEV. The question relates to why the forecast outturn was not there. I have already elucidated the reasons for not including it on this occasion. I introduced this in the first place much to the chagrin of my Department which opposed the additional work, but it does necessitate trying to get an estimate from various Departments before the AEV, probably in the middle of November, of what their Supplementaries are going to be. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has just told me that the Office of Public Works has only submitted its Supplementary Estimate today.</P>

      <P>It would have been false to publish a forecast outturn on this occasion by Vote head because it would not have been realistic. I decided to adopt the previous practice. At this stage the Supplementary Estimates from a number of Departments have been put before the House in the last two days and they must go to committees to be voted on. I am therefore in a position to give the Deputy the prospective forecast outturn for 2001, which is subject to the usual revision. There may be some changes between now and the end of the year. That is quite normal. I introduced the innovation of changing what had gone on for the last 60 or 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeated about five times that he introduced this innovation in 1997. I am trying to find out why he dropped the innovation this year. I believe he is hiding something, just as the Minister for Health and Children was hiding the problems in the health boards which accidentally got onto the Internet, though they were taken off. I want the Minister to acknowledge that he deliberately left out this column because the Book of Estimates <Col N="385" /> had not been completed. He published a Book of Estimates which was incomplete and, in a certain sense, fake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is slightly mistaken as regards the purpose of the Book of Estimates which relates to Estimates for next year. The Estimates for 2001 are now largely historical, although they were included in the recent Book of Estimates for the purposes of comparison. One could include the Estimates for the last ten years if one wished to identify trends during that time. When publishing a Book of Estimates, there is no obligation to publish Estimates for the present year, as the only requirement is to publish Estimates for the year to come. The Book of Estimates is about necessary expenditure for the coming year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that the interview to which he refers was wide ranging, covering the spectrum of national and international economic developments. When questioned on the implications of the budgetary arithmetic for the national development plan, I did not state that projects would be delayed. I said that my goal as regards the infrastructure programme of the NDP is to enable the key elements of the plan to proceed with the pace with which they have been put forward.</P>
      <P>The NDP is a seven year programme, which provides that year on year allocations may need to be modified in the context of budgetary parameters and available resources. The economic and social infrastructure part of the NDP sets down in current prices the indicative allocation of resources for each of the seven years of the plan, provided there is total Exchequer and EU investment of 7.95 billion between 2000 and 2002. Based on the recent abridged Estimates and the latest estimated outturns for 2000 and 2001, there will be a total Exchequer investment of around 8 billion over the first three years of the infrastructure programme, which is fully in line with that promised in the published operational programme. The Exchequer is, therefore, honouring its funding obligations in respect of the infrastructure operational programme under the plan. This reflects the importance attached by the Government to tackling the country's infrastructure deficit through the ambitious programme set out in the plan.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Jim Mitchell rightly pointed out, this year's Estimates do not include three year projections, although the Minister will be aware that such projections were in last year's Estimates.

Returning to the original question and my comments in the RTE interview, it should be borne in mind that the plan lasts for seven years. It is sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes, such as delays in some infrastructural projects for reasons unconnected with money. Other projects have proceeded a little more speedily than intended. Members will recall that the plan clearly sets out that it is dependent on economic growth and the budgetary position going forward. Targets for Exchequer funding during the first three years of the plan are being met.</P>

      <P>I repeat my point that estimated Exchequer capital spending for 2002 is £500 million more than the Minister said last year that it would be. Can the Minister confirm that the allocation to the National Roads Authority is £400 million less than the amount the authority has contracted to spend during 2002? Will the NRA have to delay or postpone projects?</P>

      <P>As I pointed out at the press conference for the publication of the abridged Estimates, I am considering allocating additional funding for infrastructural projects in the budget. Such allocations are contingent on competing priorities and Deputies will have to wait until next Wednesday to discover the extent of such funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to ask a second supplementary question. The Minister's comments confirm Deputy Jim Mitchell's point that the abridged Estimates have been devalued. They have become a small part of the budgetary story and tell us virtually nothing about Government spending plans. IBEC, the social partners and other independent commentators have said that cutbacks in infrastructural spending at this stage of the national development plan would constitute short-term thinking and would be short-sighted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entitled to put across his opinion, which is more welcome than the woolly thinking I have heard over the years. My comments at the press conference, regarding the Deputy's first question about the devaluing of the abridged Estimates, were not picked up by the media. I said there is a good case for a single budgetary process, as is the case in other countries, and that we should review our process of declaring Estimates three or four weeks before the budget, which deals with taxation and some items of expenditure, is announced. I have strong views on the matter and I hope to be in a position to do something about it in the future.</P>

      <P>I announced the Government's response to the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions on 28 September 2001. The Government has decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and has directed that a working group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the PPF, should be established. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, within six months of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>Parallel structures, subject to the same time frame and remit, are being established for the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Arrangements are also being made to facilitate pensioner group representation in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. My Department has had discussions with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regarding the establishment of the working group. Its terms of reference have been agreed and my Department has asked that a plenary meeting of the group be held as soon as possible. I am hopeful that this will occur in December. My Department is also finalising arrangements for involving pensioners in the working group process. A number of pensioner groups have been invited to send representatives to a preliminary meeting on 11 December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government undertook to protect public service pensions in its action programme for the <Col N="389" /> millennium. The Commission on Public Service Pensions has made recommendations in relation to the form which future pension increases should take. This will come within the remit of the implementation working group to which I have referred. As I have already indicated, arrangements are being made to facilitate pensioner group representation in relation to the commission recommendations on pensions increase policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view in relation to maintaining public service pay parity? It has been the case for some time that pensioners receive increases in their pensions as salaries increase.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's view on whether this system should be maintained? Following Delivering Better Local Government and other initiatives, a raft of changes has occurred in local authority structures in terms of the development of programme managers, etc. What is the Minister's view of pay parity for people who held such positions under a different title in the past, for example, council secretaries and county managers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1997 pre-election campaign, public pensioner groups conducted a significant degree of lobbying. At that time and in the programme for Government subsequently agreed, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats committed themselves to the principle of pension parity upon which the Government acted on taking office. The decisions we made were welcomed by the public service committee of ICTU. I am aware of the difficulties to which the Deputy referred. The PCW restructuring process which occurred in many areas of the public service resulted in difficulties in making comparisons between new jobs and previous ones.</P>
      <P>The McAleese commission was instituted by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, to examine the area of public service pensions. The commission's comprehensive report, covering a wide range of groups, advanced a number of ideas to deal with this matter which received a general welcome from the affected parties, including unions. Arising from that, the Government set up an implementation group and recently decided to invite pensioner groups to come before the group to outline their cases. The public service pensions group suggested that pensions should be increased in line with a general index of recorded changes in public service pay rather than changes in the pay of serving grades, as happens at present. That was the collective wisdom articulated by the group. The implementation group will proceed with its discussions with other interested parties after which it will publish a report upon which the Government will act.</P>

      <P>For somebody who normally speaks his mind I am disappointed that, although the Minister referred to the commission's report <Col N="390" /> and its contents, he did not outline his own view on this matter. Is he in favour of maintaining pay parity for retired civil servants? I want a straight &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer. If the Minister is in favour of this position, will he give us a commitment to stand over it and seek to maintain it in the future? If the Minister is not prepared to give us a straight answer, we can only conclude he is not in favour of maintaining pay parity.</P>

      <P>The Government accepted the thrust of the McAleese commission's report, as did almost all the relevant groups throughout the country. The commission outlined possible methods of approaching this area in the future which will overcome the problems that have existed in this area. In 1997, we outlined a floor for some groups which almost everyone accepted. However, some people on the margins attempted to compare jobs they held years ago with current jobs and that proved exceptionally difficult as job specifications have changed in a wide range of areas with the agreement of unions and in accordance with changing work practices. The Government has adopted the principle advanced by the McAleese commission, as has almost everyone else, and we now intend to proceed with implementation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the first and final reports of the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee inquiry into DIRT contained a large number of recommendations which fall to be implemented by a range of Departments and offices. I will confine my remarks to those recommendations which fall within my Department's direct responsibility.</P>
      <P>On 26 October 2000, in reply to a question by Deputy Howlin, I gave a detailed response on the various recommendations contained in the first report. Given time constraints, I do not propose to go over this ground again. Instead, I will outline the position with the various recommendations made in the sub-committee's final report which was published on 3 April 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that work on considering and implementing these recommendations has been given a high priority in my Department. Within the time allotted to me, it is not possible <Col N="391" /> to give a detailed response on the various recommendations for which I am responsible. In all, as a result of the sub-committee's recommendations, five separate pieces of legislation are in various stages of preparation at present. In some cases, a wide-ranging process of consultation with interested parties has also been initiated as part of the legislative drafting process. Steps are being put in hand in regard to the further studies recommended by the sub-committee. The various resourcing issues have been attended to in consultation with the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>I should mention that my Department is currently finalising a report to the Committee of Public Accounts which will detail the progress made on implementing all the recommendations made in the final report for which my Department has direct responsibility.

      <P>The establishment of an independent Oireachtas commission was proposed by the Committee of Public Accounts under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell. On 26 June 2001, the Government authorised the drafting of a Bill to provide for the establishment of an Oireachtas commission. This decision also authorised the initiation of consultation with the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the clerks of Dáil and Seanad Éireann and the Comptroller and Auditor General. These consultations are ongoing and the circulation of the draft heads of a Bill, on which work has commenced in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will be extended to include party leaders.</P>
      <P>The Public Accounts Committee also recommended that the funding formula established for the commission should include provision for the resourcing of individual Members and Oireachtas committees in line with best practice in other EU member states, an idea which Deputy Mitchell advocated long before he became Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. An independent resource review has been established which will specifically address the resourcing of individual Members and Oireachtas committees. Until such time as the consultants for Deloitte &amp; Touche submit their final report in January 2002, this issue cannot be adequately addressed. It is anticipated that the commission will maintain control of the financing of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The stability and growth pact requires member states to commit themselves to aim for a medium-term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus. The pact clarifies the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure provided for under Article 104 of the treaty and it also provides for the strengthening of the surveillance of member states' budgetary positions.</P>
      <P>Under the stability and growth pact, the main elements of which were agreed at the European Council in Dublin in 1996, the majority of member states have moved from having general government deficits to running surpluses and all have reduced their general government debt levels, a development which will underpin the capacity for economic growth in the EU going forward.</P>
      <P>As recently as 21 September, the ECOFIN Council in Liége reaffirmed its commitment to the stability and growth pact in a statement on the economic impact of the 11 September attacks in the United States. In the statement, the council made clear its &ldquo;commitment to the framework, rules and full implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact&rdquo;. As far as I am concerned, nothing has changed in this regard since then.</P>
      <P>For our part, as stated in the ECOFIN Council's opinion on last year's stability programme update, Ireland continues to comply fully with the terms of the stability and growth pact. Last year, we had one of the highest general Government surpluses of any European member state and had the second lowest debt to GDP level in the European Union. An updated stability programme will be published as usual on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that budgetary policy in this and every other country in the euro zone is an issue of common concern and therefore that observations by the European Council of Ministers, the European Commission or the governments of other member states should be considered in a polite and constructive way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the terms of the stability and growth pact. Ireland is the leading light in terms of compliance with the terms of the pact. Every member state must com<Col N="393" /> ply with the terms of the stability and growth pact.</P>
      <P>There have been recent suggestions by unnamed senior European sources that the pact might be interpreted with more flexibility. These suggestions were rejected within days by the European Central Bank saying that this was not the view of the ECB. Many people speculated that flexibility could be used to ease the positions in which some of the larger member states found themselves.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the difficulties which arose last year regarding the broad economic policy guidelines, a subject with which I have dealt on many occasions. The terms of the stability and growth pact and budgetary policy in that regard are a matter of common concern. The difficulties Ireland had with the EU Commission referred to differing interpretations regarding compliance with the broad economic policy guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the broad economic policy guidelines and the growth and stability pact are interconnected? The Minister has rejected the criticism, under the guidelines, that he was spending too much when the economy was growing apace. In retrospect, does he accept that the advice he rejected at the time was valid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not. In fact, most of the people who criticised me at the time now say that the Irish plans for 2001 were the appropriate ones. Even economists who were most vociferous in criticising me said as recently as two months ago that I had been right, but of course for the wrong reasons. This shows that economics is an inexact science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The commentators may have got it wrong then but I believe they are getting it wrong again. Just before last year's budget the Minister was able to announce the likelihood of a £3.5 billion surplus. Does he not consider it horrific that this year he almost certainly faces a deficit?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic situation, worldwide and in Europe, has changed dramatically over the past year. My critics attest to the fact that the Irish policy for 2001 has been the appropriate one. Imagine the situation if, in the light of declining world growth and of what has happened economically in Ireland and throughout the world, I had adopted a very restrictive budgetary policy last year? That would have taken further demand out of the economy and would have further depressed the situation. With the benefit of hindsight, most people agree that the Irish budgetary stance was the appropriate one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure this year has grown by 21% over last year. Where is the benefit of that growth to be seen? Does the Minister <Col N="394" /> agree that we do not have the output successes which should derive from such increased expenditure? Does he also agree that it is a normal part of the economic cycle to spend more in a downturn and less when the economy is booming? Does he accept that he has left himself without money to spend in the downturn in which we now find ourselves?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have never been a proponent of that economic theory. Deputy McDowell, who has marked me for the past four and a half years, is well aware of my views which I held long before the EU was making recommendations regarding the Irish position. I have disagreed with that view of economics for well over 20 years. There is nothing unusual about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make an exception for skateboards.</P>
      <P>I will however outline the current position with regard to skateboard parks. Under the current provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, section 284, if a person carries on a trade of operating a skateboard park he or she can write off expenditure incurred on any plant or machinery which is in use in the park, over a five year period at the rate of 20% per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, if the park is located in a tax incentive area which is approved for capital <Col N="395" /> allowances for commercial premises, capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of such a park may qualify. These allowances are generally available at a rate of up to 50% of the expenditure in the first year and at a rate of 4% in remaining years for the balance of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Finally, I draw the Deputy's attention to just one of the numerous measures by which this Government provides assistance to youth and sports activities in the country. Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, grants are allocated to clubs and organisations for the development of sports and recreational facilities. Details of the 2002 sports capital programme were announced by the Minister, Deputy McDaid, last weekend and it will be open to local groups involved in the development of such facilities to apply for funding under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very detailed reply. I was not aware that tax relief was available on the equipment used in skateboard parks.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that very few fiscal measures are in place to encourage the development of facilities for children? This is one of the difficulties encountered by public representatives day in and day out. Will the Minister examine the concept of extending relief on the capital cost of construction to skateboard parks in non-tax designated areas? To the best of my knowledge there is only one skateboard park in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister faces a difficult budget. I am giving him an opportunity, with a very small innovative measure, to take the spotlight off the rest of his budget. He could call this the skateboard clause. It would give him a way out, in more ways than one. This is the Minister's opportunity to include a skateboard clause in the budget.</P>

      <Quest>when the promised Irish financial services regulatory authority will be established; the role he envisages the authority will have regarding monitoring and reporting on access to banking services, especially having regard to public concern regarding the withdrawal of certain counter services and the closure of branches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The heads of the legislation to establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority were approved by the Government in June and the text is being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The legislation will transfer existing functions of the Central Bank, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This authority is to be established within the new structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of public concern at the fast pace of developments in the financial sector. The matter was recently discussed before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I am also aware of the recent initiative of the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association to produce a code of practice on branch restructuring with particular regard to <Col N="397" /> customer communications and relations and that there is a programme of public education organised by these bodies. I welcome such debate and initiatives, which help people to adapt to the changes in the banking sector and to take advantage of the new possibilities opening up to carry out banking transactions from the home and the workplace, as well as through bank branches. The banks need to work actively to bring the public with them as they restructure the retail banking network.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that in addition to the transfer of existing functions to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the legislation will establish a new post of the Consumer Director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The consumer director will have the function of monitoring and reporting on developments in the financial sector as these affect customers, as well as taking over various existing functions in relation to consumer issues. An authoritative source of information in relation to developments in this area should assist legislators and the public in ensuring the public benefits in the period ahead from a banking sector which meets the highest international standards of quality and competitiveness. In addition, it is intended the consumer director will, <i>ex officio,</i> be a member of the board of IFSRA. This will, for the first time, place a person with a legislatively defined consumer focus at the heart of banking regulation.</P>

      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and others addressed the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, referred to by the Minister. The meeting focused on two issues, the closure of rural branches and the withdrawal of some over-the-counter services. The Director of Consumer Affairs expressed the view that while she did not have the power to regulate these matters, the new single financial regulator would have responsibility for them. In response to a question last October, the Minister said the new regulatory authority would have &ldquo;a strong focus on consumer issues.&rdquo;  Does he intend the new single financial regulator will have a focus on over-the-counter services and the closure of rural branches?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I answered parliamentary questions there was a question on the closure of branches. I said it would not be possible legislatively to provide that banks would either have to operate in a certain place or not close branches at certain locations, no more than the Government could compel a person to act uncompetitively by opening a sweet shop, bicycle shop or such like. However, I also advised that following a series of meetings with us, a code of practice had been announced by the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Mortgage Savings Association, which outlines the practice they will adopt in the future regarding possible bank clos<Col N="398" /> ures. The position on over-the-counter services will be similar.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that Irish banks must take account of competition issues. Much of the competition they face is from foreign institutions who have very few branches in the country. As much of their business is done over the telephone, the Internet and other more modern means of technology, they do very little business across the counter. Irish banks must compete with that.</P>
      <P>Recently the banks have responded to suggestions in national newspapers that they were going to close branches. One institution said it had no plans in that regard. Like any other business, it is not possible to compel an institution to operate against its own best commercial interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This impinges on the issue of whether there is collusion among the banks. There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, at least, that there is collusion among them on the issue of branch closures. For example, two banks do not close a branch in the same area. Does the Minister agree this is not just a rural but a suburban issue? People in Ballymun, Cabra and Inchicore who have lost bank branches will confirm this. Does the Minister agree the banks should be required to have at least some social concern in their business and that to maintain competition between the banks, the aspect of unspoken collusion between them should be urgently addressed and that new rules should be enforced?</P>

      <P>The Deputy raises some interesting points on the social concerns of banks and other financial institutions. All organisations should adopt that as part of their agenda. However, the job of the Legislature is not to compel people to be good, it is to compel them to operate within the law. We are straying into an area here where it would be very difficult to draw up objective criteria under which one could operate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right to highlight that bank branch closures is not only a rural phenomenon. The same is happening in Dublin and other major cities and towns. According to our figures, there has been no net reduction in bank branches in the last ten years. Branches may have been closed in some areas but others have been opened. The code of practice recently agreed to and the process banks undertake before initiating closure will have a bearing on future developments.</P>
      <P>I recently spoke to a banker who takes an opposing view on the question of branch closures. He maintains that over the next ten years banks will seek locations to open branches, that the current phase of branch closures has ended and that under the new phase it will be deemed that the way to get business is to open branches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the details about criminal cases, convictions and prison sentences for serious tax evasion are as follows. A total of 17 cases have been completed before the courts since 1996, with 16 convictions obtained. Custodial sentences were imposed in eight cases, four of which were suspended. One conviction is under appeal and three individuals are serving sentences.</P>
      <P>In 1996, one case was completed, a conviction obtained but no prison sentence was imposed. In 1997, two cases were completed, two convictions obtained and one prison sentence was imposed of six months suspended. In 1998, five cases were completed, five convictions obtained and one prison sentence was imposed of two years suspended. In 1999, two cases were completed, one conviction was obtained with no prison sentence imposed. In 2000, three cases were completed, three convictions were obtained and two prison sentences were imposed, one case of two years currently being served and one case of one year suspended. In 2001, four cases have been completed, four convictions obtained and four prison sentences were imposed, one case of six months, which is being appealed, one case of 12 months currently being served, one case of three months currently being served and one case of one year suspended.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the very high level of evidence and proof required to sustain a criminal prosecution and that prosecutions can be taken only where such evidence is available. Sentencing is a matter for the courts taking all aspects of a case into account. In the five years to 1995, only one such prosecution for serious tax evasion had been taken.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me they are satisfied with the progress being made by Revenue under their more active criminal prosecutions programme for serious tax evasion. Their proposal to set up a specialised prosecution division will further enhance progress in this area. The Deputy should not lose sight of the fact that, in addition to the above cases of serious tax evasion, Revenue obtains in excess of 1,000 convictions each year for failure to file tax returns.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reaffirm the stated determination of the Revenue Commissioners to prosecute those who did not take advantage of the so-called voluntary disclosure scheme which terminated on 19 November last?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The big change in the law was introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. The Deputy will be aware that to get a successful criminal prosecution requires a very elaborate and detailed process. The Deputy was a practising solicitor and is aware that to get a successful prosecution in a criminal case is far different from other cases and the taxpayers must have their rights protected. It is a long drawn out, tedious process. The Revenue Commissioners is setting up a specialised prosecution division which should further enhance progress in this area.</P>
      <P>There is a separate set of questions tabled on voluntary disclosures. Already the Revenue Commissioners are making their case to the court and that matter will be progressed. However, it will be a long drawn out process as the same levels of proof will be required.</P>

That is the reality, though it is not the intention of the Oireachtas or the Minister. Does the Minister agree we must further address this issue? There were 50,000 bogus non-resident accounts while there have been 16 prosecutions over the past five years. We must do something in terms of prosecutions. We do not want to put people in jail for the sake of it, but we want to send out a message to tax evaders that there is no place for tax evasion in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly bow to the Deputy's absolute knowledge in this regard. He has done significant work in recent years in this area. Proportionately the number of prosecutions here for serious tax evasion is in line with the number taken by the Inland Revenue in the UK. In my previous reply I pointed out the difficulties in having a successful criminal prosecution. I am certain the number of prosecutions will increase in coming years. While nobody can state the level of tax evasion at any one time, I am certain that <Col N="401" /> as a result of activities in recent years, better compliance by taxpayers and more rigorous investigations and standards on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, the level of tax evasion is much lower now than it was a number of years ago.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme is being reviewed by an interdepartmental group which is being chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department are also represented on the group. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received more than 260 written submissions from interested parties.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the work of the review group is complex. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>
      <P>Therefore, many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. This work and analysis takes time.</P>
      <P>I have not received the final report and recommendations of the review group. I understand, however, that the work of the review group is at an advanced stage. As I have said in the past, I appreciate the difficulties faced in coping with everyday life by people who suffer from some form or other of physical disability. I assure the House that any proposals which may emanate from the review group, whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise, will receive full consideration.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate this is a very generous scheme and is very costly to the Exchequer. If we were starting again I am sure we would have taken the route taken by other European countries rather than pursuing this scheme. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will attest, when he had ideas in another position many years ago about reforming the scheme, all hell broke lose. The group has been teasing out all the problems. There are up to 360,000 persons who could claim some form of physical disability and it is not easy deciding which disabilities to include and which to exclude. I hope the group will be able to report in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment allows the family support agency to provide information and co-operate with other public authorities to assist persons in balancing their work and family responsibilities. It is important this comes within the remit of the agency and I am glad the Minister has brought forward this amendment. We have a poor record in supporting families in trying to balance work and family responsibilities. When comparisons are made it becomes clear that other European countries have been way ahead of us in providing supportive child care and more family friendly work policies. I note the amendment allows the family support agency co-operate with other public authorities. The Equality Authority is one group I would like to see it linking with, and perhaps some initiatives could result from them working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current arrangements are not without their difficulties. We have a combination of career breaks, part-time work, maternity leave, parental leave and carers' leave and there is a need for streamlining and for more information to be <Col N="404" /> given to people. I believe the agency will provide a very good facility for supporting families in that regard. In relation to maternity protection legislation, many employees are running into difficulties. Female employees returning to work are not given their &ldquo;old&rdquo; job back but many employers are offering what purports to be suitable alternative employment which, in many cases, is not suitable alternative employment. Such employees believe they are being discriminated against arising from the fact that they took maternity leave. I presume a case of that nature would go to the Equality Authority or the Labour Court but a situation could arise where an individual or a couple needing help in relation to other issues would turn up at a family support agency seeking advice and support. It is important to have that provided for in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There is another area of difficulty in relation to nurses who want permanent part-time positions and, although there is an agreement to allow that, they are finding it difficult to get the relevant authority to support that option. There is a real role for the agency in examining this issue, becoming well informed on it and working with the other authorities, as provided for in the Minister's amendment, such as the Equality Authority, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the employer bodies and the trade unions in order to get information to people on best practice in relation to family friendly policies and the various options. I welcome the inclusion of this in the terms of reference of the agency. We are still at a relatively early stage in relation to this important area, despite much discussion on it, and we are not particularly generous in providing flexible supports. The economic boom has helped and there has been some advance in recent times. However, from the statistics which Deputy Broughan quoted earlier on what is actually available, there is still quite a gap between what is available and what we would like to have available. I hope the Family Support Agency will play a strong role in that regard. I realise it is not really a primary task but, given the importance of this issue, it will certainly emerge in the work of the agency as a key issue.</P>
    <P>Last week, in England, there was a very interesting ruling from the courts on the issue of whether employees have to do shift work where they are trying to combine work and family life. The decision was that the employers did not have the right to require the employee to do shift work. This would be seen as almost revolutionary in this country but it may well be indicative of how things will develop here and that employers will have to be more flexible. Irish employers fought against paid parental leave although practically every other country in Europe has introduced some form of paid parental leave. Very limited maternity leave arrangements have been accepted in this country and I welcome the recent changes which the Minister has made in that regard. The previous situation displayed a rather mean approach to supporting women and their <Col N="405" /> partners in combining work and family life. Great credit is due to the many families who struggled to achieve that under difficult circumstances. I hope the agency will come forward with recommendations in this regard, drawing on the experience it will gain from working with families.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 11 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) to support, promote and develop those projects in the Family and Community Services Resource Centres programme which elect to transfer to the Agency,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments and some similar amendments in the name of Deputy Fitzgerald are at the core of the problem &ndash; perhaps the only major problem the Opposition has had with this Bill. The family affairs unit is widely respected by community workers and those who work with families. When this Bill was first mooted, there was grave concern among a significant number of existing family resource centres whose primary function, as they saw it, related to social inclusion measures rather than the family mediation service. Against that background, many of the agencies concerned &ndash; the Community Action Network, the Resource Centre Forum, the regional and specialist support agencies and the community development national representatives &ndash;<Col N="406" /> felt that the Minister did not engage in sufficiently wide consultation.</P>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech, the Minister said he engaged in a wide series of family fora at which 1,000 people attended. Deputy Fitzgerald and I attended those fora. Some of the older family resource centres, in particular, were concerned about a lack of consultation as to how the new Family Support Agency would operate. I had many presentations in that regard from family resource centres around the country who felt that, to some extent, they were being put in a corner by the Minister and that, irrespective of whether they wanted to transfer to the agency, they had to do so. That is the essence of amendment No. 3. With regard to amendment No. 5, many of those centres felt it would be more appropriate for them, while working closely with the agency, to continue independently under the community development support project programme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That is the nub of the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the key points to emerge from our consultations was that there has been an absence of an open and transparent consultation process with the key stakeholders of the CDSPS, including the national advisory committee, the community development projects, the family resource centre, core funded groups and regional and specialist support agencies, and that this has serious implications for the future operation of these programmes.</P>
    <P>It is felt the strategic planning process which takes place nationally in this area will be undermined by the way the Bill was brought forward. The first principle of community development is that one should consult the community concerned but this has not been undertaken sufficiently by the Minister. Without information, choice or consultation, structures such as family resource centres are being moved into the new agency. They should have the fundamental right of self selection.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Minister made this decision is in stark contradiction to the Government's commitment to consultation and partnership with the community and voluntary sectors, as detailed in the NDP, PPF, NAPS, the NAPS submitted to Brussels and, above all, in the White Paper on voluntary activity which was discussed at length in the House last year. It was generally felt that the lack of consultation and the diktat approach of telling certain resource centres where they had to go are a potential erosion of the social inclusion commitments in the national development plan. It fundamentally weakens the process of community development nationally by the transfer of neighbourhood projects from the explicitly anti-poverty context of the CDSPS to the mediation and counselling context of the family support agency.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, there are still concerns. The mediation service is a professional service. I pay tribute to my former colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Mervyn <Col N="407" /> Taylor, who played a dynamic role in the early development &ndash; I acknowledge this Minister has continued that development &ndash; and expansion of the mediation service beyond the Dublin region when he was a Minister in both the partnership and rainbow Governments of the early 1990s. He deserves great credit for his role in this area. However, there were concerns that people without qualifications would have to be involved in the specialist and demanding role of family mediation. The key point was that people in the community social inclusion and development sector, an area with which I am familiar and in which I was heavily involved before being elected to this House, were fearful that their role would be subsumed into other areas. They feared the impact on communities such as the 25 RAPID communities which comprise many deprived rural and urban areas. The remit of centres in those areas was to run all kinds of projects to improve social life and development in those areas. They fear that those projects could be in danger.</P>
    <P>The obvious way out is to allow a certain amount of self-determination to the community groups concerned, even as this Bill is going through the Houses, by giving them the freedom to continue with the work of social inclusion through the community development programme or to elect to join the new agency. I have commended the Minister and your party, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle on their emphasis&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;on the development of the family unit and family support policies. However, that could be undermined to an extent by giving social inclusion projects less importance in the implementation of this Bill. In the Dublin region the parish family resource centres, with which I am closely involved, took social inclusion as their remit when they were established. I referred on Committee Stage to the many ways, including the breakfast clubs for children of low income backgrounds, the anti-joyriding campaign, the anti-drugs campaign and the drugs task force, they try to deal with the severe exclusion problems that face families in certain deprived areas of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider these amendments and offer a degree of flexibility. It does not mean centres could not elect, at some stage in the future and following extra consultation, to opt to join the support agency. In the meantime, they would have the flexibility to see how the agency develops. One of the Department's interesting areas is the community support programme. There is surely potential for developing that in the future into the broader socio-economic areas relating to jobs and provision of economic activity. I hope the Minister will accept the amendments and give a little <Col N="408" /> discretion to our colleagues throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a detailed discussion of this on Committee Stage. The Minister told the committee that his officials were due to meet the family resource centres within a few days. If that meeting has been held, I hope some of the difficulties with the family resource centres were resolved.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly true that the way the Minister went about the establishment of the new family support agency raised concerns among the family resource centres. There has been a huge amount of lobbying by resource centres, which is an expression of their concern about the structures of the agency. That is a shame because there is enormous potential in this agency for the family resource centres, the mediation services and the counselling services to work together. However, the family resource centres felt a real anxiety, which is reflected in the amendments, at the beginning of the process of establishing the family support agency. I hope that has been dealt with because it is important they have confidence in the new agency. The way it was initiated, the centres' feeling of being outside the process and the lack of consultation they say they experienced in relation to its establishment will not, I hope, stymie the work of the agency or the centres' contributions to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister also reassured us on Committee Stage that the work of the family resource centres would continue and, hopefully, develop in the future but that the community development ethos, as it were, and the goal of social inclusion would continue under the agency. It might be reassuring if the Minister would spell out in more detail the type of model he envisages the agency working under and the way the different strands will be incorporated. It will be a complex undertaking to ensure the three different strands are equally well supported. Much will depend on the chief executive, the board and their terms of reference. It is not an easy task to run these three different types of service under one roof. It could potentially offer much support to communities but it will not be without its difficulties. That is what is reflected in the amendment and what was expressed by the family resource centres when they met us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope these anxieties have been dealt with. It is important that the energy in the family resource centres is brought into the new agency and that the initial difficulties around the establishment of the agency do not restrict the enthusiasm, commitment and expertise of the centres from reaching its full potential in the new agency. The Minister felt he could not accept the amendments on Committee Stage. He believed he could not include them in legislation because some of the concepts, such as community development, were too vague. However, he did reassure both Members and the agencies concerned that the ethos and type of work in which the three differ<Col N="409" /> ent groups have been involved will continue in the new agency.</P>
    <P>If there is anything further the Minister would like to add following the meeting that he was going to have with the family resource centres, I would be interested in hearing it. I hope there has been progress and that there will be ongoing progress in relation to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their remarks. In relation to these amendments I must say that I have a much more optimistic view of life than they might perhaps have in relation to this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that is just the way I am. I travelled the country with my officials and held family fora in at least eight different locations where over 1,000 people attended. All the issues in relation to the family policy area were thrashed out. All the partners in the voluntary community activity in the country were invited and most of them attended. The Family Mediation Service also attended to discuss the issues of family mediation. Deputy Broughan is quite correct when he says that the former Minister, Deputy Mervyn Taylor did a lot of work when he was there. There has been a dramatic change in the past four years &ndash; I do not mean in a political way but in a factual way. The Family Mediation Service had two centres, one in Dublin and one in Limerick, when I came to office; today there are 11 centres. The money for the mediation service has quadrupled in that four year period. We would have had another centre up and running in the north west but for the fact that there is no available qualified mediator in that area. We will be opening another mediation service in Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>In the area of marriage counselling, I can well remember when I came to office the amount of money that had been available for marriage counselling grants. It was in the region of £900,000 and had been stuck at that level for a number of years. It has increased exponentially over the last four years to somewhere over £4.5 million. Huge resources have been put into this area. We have even diverted some of the resources into the area of marriage preparation and into bereavement counselling. We have diverted some of the money that we had for counselling into the area of research. We indicated on Committee Stage the work that has been carried out in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third component which is the one at issue in this amendment is the family resource centres. This Government promised that we would increase the numbers of family resource centres which had numbered about ten for the previous ten years since they were initiated by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, in 1990. Ten projects were up and running in 1997. We stated in our programme for Government that we would increase the numbers dramatically &ndash; up to 100 over the <Col N="410" /> term of this Government. There are already 80 up and running and there are proposals for more.</P>
    <P>We could have stood still &ndash; we could have had the family affairs unit dealing with these three areas and other areas to do with family policy as they arise. The view was &ndash; and I know the Deputies do not disagree with this &ndash; that we should have a separate, dedicated agency with expertise on the board that was not available to us in the Department, in order to further expand those three main core areas and to look at new areas of family policy. That is why we decided to set up the agency.</P>
    <P>It was acknowledged in the discussions that it would be somewhat ludicrous to have a family support agency and at the same time have family resource centres outside the agency. It would not be possible. It was the strong view of Government that family resource centres would have to be included in the family support agency when it was established. The family resource centres could then go from strength to strength doing exactly what they have been doing. It is not correct for Deputy Broughan to say that they will change the focus or that the focus will be changed because of this change. Built into the legislation is an onus on the agency and on the family resource centres to continue in the role of examining social inclusion in the communities where they operate.</P>
    <P>I made these points on Second and Committee Stages. Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about consultation and even since Committee Stage there has been a meeting with the support agencies. Support agencies are the network groups which assist the various family resource centres and community development projects. We had a meeting with the support agencies. I met the family resource centres staff at the launch of the forum in the Mansion House. The forum represents about 40 of the 80 resource centres. There is a logic &ndash; and I do not understand why people say otherwise &ndash; in having the resource centres as part of the support agencies. To allow one to elect to remain outside the family support agency would in my view lead to a dissipation of the core issues. If family resource centres were allowed to remain outside while some chose to stay in, ultimately the centres which chose to stay outside would not really have the core principle of what family resource centres are about &ndash; assisting families in the locality. That is not to say that they would not continue to have the whole idea of developing their local community. I cannot see the logic in what the Deputy is suggesting in this amendment &ndash; that they can elect to be one or the other. The family resource centres engage with the local communities; they work with the local communities particularly in the area of preservation of family relationships.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the position of the officials within my Department and I as Minister is that the family unit will continue, the Minister will still have responsibility in the area, the family resource centres when part of the support agency will not only continue to do their work as <Col N="411" /> carried out over the years but they will be able to develop in a co-ordinated fashion with better expertise. I say that with due respect to the people in my Department over the years. I ask the Deputies not to take a negative view. I do not mean that as a criticism because I know they must accept the representations. I am somewhat surprised that people have such a negative view of what is being suggested. This is an extremely positive development that will assist family resource centres around the country. It was all right when there were only ten centres; there are now 80 and there will be at least 100 in due course. They need to be under the focus of the family support agency into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes a cogent argument but we still have the problem that there are a number of centres, many of which have professional workers, who are still concerned that the social inclusion function will not be sufficiently highlighted. Perhaps we can come back to it in a later amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) to support and develop Family Resource Centres according to principles of community development and to promote social inclusion,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have already gone into the detail of this and I will not repeat it. We are asking the Minister to write into the legislation that the work in which the family resource centres have been involved, such as community development and inclusion, will continue in the work of the new Family Support Agency. The Minister has said that will happen but the workers would prefer to see it written into the legislation in order to be reassured about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed surprise at what he perceives as the negative attitude of some people, but I incline more towards the view that they have concerns in regard to the priority that this work would get under the new agency. For whatever reason these concerns arose and have been expressed to many TDs in the House from a variety of resource centres throughout the country. There can be no doubt that this is a real issue for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this amendment is to put into the legislation that the work they have been involved in &ndash; community involvement and promoting social inclusion &ndash; will be continued by the work of the new agency. Despite the Celtic tiger and the progress that has been made, the question of social inclusion and increasing inequalities is a real one. These workers are very committed to tackling that issue and to bring forward local initiatives to deal with exclusion in <Col N="412" /> local communities. They want to be reassured that they can continue to do that work under the umbrella of this new agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects we are putting the same argument again. The fundamental element of this amendment is that we want to make it a core function of the agency that the family resource centres will be supported according to the principles of community development and to promote social inclusion.</P>
      <P>In section 4 (2), the Minister states that the agency in performing the functions conferred on it shall have regard to Government policy, in particular social inclusion policy. The Minister mentions social inclusion but what we are proposing is a far stronger approach in regard to social inclusion by making it a <i>raison d'être </i>of the new agency. There is a world of difference between saying that a central element for the existence of the Family Support Agency is the issue of social inclusion and community development and saying that it is something that the new board and chair and chief executive will take into account.</P>
      <P>It is closely linked to some of the major concerns that family resource centres have had in the past in regard to the provisions for research and information. I am aware that the Minister launched yesterday another report in the series from the family unit of his Department in regard to supporting parents, and I commend him on that. There has been a whole range of reports produced to date &ndash; I do not know how many there are in total &ndash; and it is fantastic work. It would be useful if we become as advanced a democracy as some of the Scandinavian democracies or some of the Benelux countries, for the Opposition to be given assistance in providing research to highlight the gaps in Government policy. I do not expect this Government ever to be so democratic as to allow that to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information in reports that we have seen already such as that on grandparenthood is valuable. One of the biggest problems faced by family resource centres, in spite of having very good committees, is the dearth of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was involved with a group in the Northside Centre for the Unemployed, and one of the first things we had to do was try to get some fundamental information in the parishes in which we operated as to the exact levels of unemployment, family income and so on. One of the big gaps in Government policy is in the area of justice, not just in social inclusion. It is unlikely that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will be listening to this but we do not have statistics on a spatial basis. We cannot say that such and such an area in the <Col N="413" /> midlands, the northside or the south west deserves extra resources. The research has simply not been done and what exists has not been done in a spatial way.</P>
    <P>I put it forward in regard to last year's budget that we need a great deal more research through the NAPS and by the Government itself on research into spatial disadvantage. We know where the areas are and we know the average incomes of certain parishes around the country are extremely low. We are aware that poverty has become endemic through a lack of economic development and yet we have not been able to take any fundamental action.</P>
    <P>For those reasons there is huge scope for inserting into the functions of the Family Support Agency an absolute commitment to the principles of community development and the active development of social inclusion &ndash; not that it would be taken into account, but that it would be a core role.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that community activists, professionals and board members came to see us in this House. It was their concern that the brilliant work that has been done in recent decades &ndash; and accelerated through the partnership process in 1987 and onwards through four of five programmes &ndash; could be lost through slippage because it is not at the heart of the remit of the new Family Support Agency.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Combat Poverty Agency exists as well as others such as local partnership companies, Leader groups and local authority development companies, but from a family-oriented point of view we had a unique opportunity to make it a primary function of the Family Support Agency.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment in my name and that of Deputy Fitzgerald and to insert it into the functions so there can be no doubt that social inclusion will be at the very heart of the work of this agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment as presented by Deputies Fitzgerald and Broughan. I have been watching the debate on the monitor up to this point. The Minister presents a very definite line and offers reassurance to those who are involved in the family resource centres network that the vista before them is not one of which they should be afraid. I would like to reflect my support for the amendment while recognising it is imperative that the community development principles under which family resource centres operate continue to be the basis for their operations. As the Minister is well aware, and this has been referred to by other Deputies, there is a great concern, which is not contrived, that this should be reflected in the legislation. On Second Stage I put that and a number of other concerns to the Minister. I ask once more that this strengthened position sought under the amendment through the insertion of a new paragraph (f) be accepted as it will help <Col N="414" /> relieve some of the concerns people have and recognise that FRCs fear the principles under which they have operated may be changed to a counselling and mediation focus.</P>
      <P>I want to add my support. It is imperative that we maintain the current thrust of the FRC network. There are two family resource centres in my constituency, which is adjacent to the Minister's, and there are two in County Meath, giving a total of four in the north east region. Each has reflected its concerns to the relevant Oireachtas Members over the past number of months. In part, this is indicative of a recognition on their part and that of the wider community that there is a breakdown in the traditional support network provided by the extended family and the wider local community has a critical role to play.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will be aware, this has been exemplified in the work the FRCs have undertaken. The role of the community focused FRCs has been critical in helping to fill a vacuum not only of advices and support but the many social needs of those in greatest need to combat their isolation and sense of marginalisation and all the terrible tragedies that can emanate from that. We are all too well aware of how that can play itself out in life's sorry story. I wish to add my voice in support of the amendment and urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

I cannot be accused of favouritism because there is none in Louth, which is a source of regret. Perhaps before the Government leaves office&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all. The Deputy did not read the statistics published by the CSO which have been disguised by the presence of Coca-Cola in the county. The Border region is one of the worst off in Ireland, unfortunately, and that has a great deal to do with the conflict on the island over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand why FRCs have adopted a community development approach and I empathise with their desire to maintain that. It is my wish that that would be the case. There seems to be some misunderstanding as to whether FRCs will be forced to accommodate mediation and marriage counselling services. Nothing could be further from the truth and that is not envisaged in the legislation. It is probably not prohibited in the legislation but it could not happen, particularly in regard to mediation and marriage counselling. Professional bodies are involved in these areas which would not allow counselling or mediation to take place if those providing the services were not fully qualified. At the same time it might be possible for some of the larger FRCs to contract in these services and while that may well happen by not including or excluding these ser<Col N="415" /> vices FRCs will be allowed to develop in their own way.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the mediation service has a particular ethos. We are not limiting or confirming this ethos in the legislation or the principles under which the service operates because it would be impossible to define such principles or the professional ethic of mediators. The more that is provided for in the legislation in that respect, the greater the restrictions on the services. As a result of changes that have progressively been made over the past four years, bereavement and suicide counselling are provided along with marriage counselling and a research programme has been developed. If principles were laid down in the <Col N="416" /> legislation in regard to counselling, more than 450 groups which have been in receipt of counselling grants generally could be restricted. Departmental officials could come along and inform different groups that they cannot offer certain services because it is not provided for under the principles laid down in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I caution Members. They must accept that the issue of community development has been at the core of FRCs and it is not envisaged that that will change following the passage of the legislation. The legislation specifically refers to social inclusion and the agency must bear that in mind as it deals with resource centres from now on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I highlighted the fundamental flaw in the legislation arising from the automatic assumption of culpability on the part of the registered owner of a vehicle even though he may not have been driving it at the time. I am probably not the first to point this out to the Minister but we have an obligation to deal with this problem because we should not pass legislation we know will not survive a court challenge. I suspect that this one will not.</P>
      <P>The immediate practical problem is that this will put enormous additional pressures on the courts, as registered owners have no option and are automatically referred to the courts if they refuse to accept the fine or penalty points.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends the grounds on which a driver may be requested to undergo a breath test and stops just short of random breath testing. I welcome this. However, the Minister is aware of the problem with the evidential breath testing boxes. There are 37 of them in use around the country. If their use is to become more widespread, and I assume that is one of the reasons for the Bill, the presumption of their accuracy will not be an adequate defence when it is challenged as it has been already. The Minister will have to go further if this method for testing for alcohol is to be regarded as cast-iron evidence in any court case. At the very least, existing problems need to be resolved.</P>
      <P>I am highlighting these problems to ensure there are not any loopholes in the Bill and that the legislation has a genuine impact on driver behaviour rather than merely increasing the number of court offences we are facing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the bilateral co-operation with other EU member states in applying driver disqualification. This is particularly relevant to us because of our border with Northern Ireland. I am sure I am not the only public representative who has received complaints about the apparent immunity of Northern Ireland drivers in the South. I am sure that feeling is reciprocated north of the border. I hope there will be active North-South co-operation in notifying each other of driver disqualification. I wish it was something that could go further and that penalty points applied here would be reciprocated in the North. Perhaps that is an area for further future co-operation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the transfer of control of taxi stands and the power to determine the location of bus stops from the Garda Commissioner to the local authorities. This is vital to the functioning of the current system. I do not know if the Minister is aware that his colleague Deputy O'Rourke is presiding over a gross abuse of the monopoly of Dublin Bus which is refusing to allow private bus operators use existing bus stops and is forcing duplication of the entire network when private operators get licences, few as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than a year, Dublin Bus has had an injunction against Dublin Corporation providing multi-user shelters. It is dog in the manger stuff. Dublin Bus will not provide the shelters but will not allow anyone else to provide them either. I <Col N="420" /> ask the Minister to use his influence with his colleague in lifting this injunction, getting back to the real world and having some thought for commuters rather than for Dublin Bus alone.</P>
    <P>If this does not happen, the rationalisation provided for in this Bill will be futile because it will not make any difference. I welcome the Bill in principle. Our road traffic code is technical and arcane. I would not claim to be an expert, but even I can see that it leaves itself open to challenge in a variety of ways. It is also flawed in terms of the resources and technology available to implement it. Much work is needed on this Bill before it is passed into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the long overdue introduction of this Bill. However, it is too little, too late. Since the Bill was published in March, more than 250 people have been killed on our roads. As we all know, Ireland has the worst fatality rates in the EU. This is evident every Monday morning when we read the litany of fatalities from the previous weekend &ndash; a litany of shame for this Government.</P>
      <P>The legislation was to have been passed into law in 1999. Upgrading of the Garda IT systems and the computerisation of the national drivers file was to have been completed by 2000 and the new penalty points system in place by January 2001. The new system is running two years behind schedule and as a consequence at least 100 extra lives will be lost on our roads. So much for this Government's commitment to road safety and the reduction in fatalities by 20% by 2002 &ndash; a goal which everyone agrees cannot be reached.</P>
      <P>To its credit, this is the first Government to introduce a road safety strategy, although it has failed to implement some of even the most basic proposals. This legislation, though it does not go far enough, will have a dramatic impact on the number of fatalities on our roads but it begs the question as to whether the Government ever wanted to implement such laws.</P>
      <P>Leaving these criticisms aside, this is a positive development and one which should be welcomed. However, it misses a golden opportunity to address fundamental problems in the way in which we use our roads. The Minister for Public Enterprise is forcing more heavy goods vehicles and vehicular traffic on to our roads. The proposal by Irish Rail to reduce its capacity to carry freight on the network by nearly 50% contradicts not only Government policy but EU policy and it flies in the face of this legislation and the road safety strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>HGVs are implicated in one in five of all road fatalities and the current proposal would see an additional 30,000 HGV journeys per annum. Such fatalities have been brought home to us by the deaths of Dominic Wogan and Fiona O'Neill who were killed on the Dublin-Belfast road last week, just as they planned to go to Australia. That HGVs are involved in so many fatalities puts a question over not only the proposal by Irish Rail but also road design. Throughout the country new <Col N="421" /> roads have been designed and built to relieve congestion and reduce accident rates, however the design of some of these, and more especially the design of the junctions, raises serious questions which have not been addressed by local authorities or the engineering firms involved.</P>
    <P>I am aware of two such junctions on the Athlone relief road where there has been a series of accidents. The local authority has to repair the warning signs on an almost weekly basis because they are being knocked down by motorists. This situation is repeated throughout the country as the number of accident black spots, which have seen repeated accidents take place over the years, have yet to be upgraded. In many cases they will only be upgraded after a fatal accident. Why do we have to wait for someone to be killed before any action is taken? Even when they are upgraded it can take years before such works are completed. In one such example, only after a fatal accident did the NRA address a dangerous section of road, even though members of the local authority had been pressing for such action for years. Now, three years after traffic calming has commenced, the upgrading has yet to be completed. How could this improve road safety? Even when such works are completed, signs indicating men at work, loose chippings and so on can remain up for years. This has become so prevalent throughout the country that most drivers ignore such warning signs. This is all the responsibility of an unelected, unaccountable authority, namely, the National Roads Authority. It is high time the NRA was made directly responsible and accountable to this House and that these and other serious questions were raised with them and proper and adequate responses obtained.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the condition of our roads and the NRA, serious questions must be raised about the causes of accidents. The NRA compiles statistics on road accidents and the causes of such accidents. It trots out figures such as 40% of accidents involve drinking and driving, 40% of accidents involve young drivers and 45% of drivers do not wear seat belts. Yet we are never told of the number of accidents where the road structure itself is a major contributing factor. Why? For two reasons. The NRA is not willing to highlight its own inadequacies and it is not prepared to put the spotlight on the Department of the Environment and Local Government because he who pays the piper calls the tune.</P>
    <P>A further question arises in relation to the drink driving figures. All those involved in road safety claim that 40% of road fatalities involve drink driving yet nobody can stand over these figures. It is a misrepresentation of the road accident figures to make such a claim as these figures are not compiled and in many cases the level of alcohol is never even assessed. As a consequence, to make such a claim is erroneous and the true extent of this as a contributing factor is unknown. If the numbers are accurate then Garda enforcement and the National Safety Council's advertising campaigns have failed dismally. Figures are <Col N="422" /> available for the extent to which drivers break the speed limit &ndash; as a contributing factor in road accidents it is easily assessed. Similar figures are not compiled in relation to alcohol.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong to assume automatically that accidents which happen in the early hours of the morning involve alcohol. Other factors such as speed or fatigue are rarely taken into consideration in such circumstances. A proper road accident investigation unit within the Garda is required. The framework for such a unit already exists within the PSV licence inspectorate. Such a unit could investigate the root causes of many road accidents and this information could be used to address the specific contributing factors. Similar work is already performed by the insurance industry when assessing claims but this information is never collated or published. The insurance industry itself must take a more proactive approach in this area. This would have a positive impact on the public's perception of road safety. If such statistics were compiled by the insurance companies it would be possible to differentiate between genuine accidents and downright carelessness and the results could also be used to make the public more conscious of dangerous driving habits.</P>
    <P>An accident may be caused by somebody's answering a mobile phone or tuning the radio if the driver takes his eye off the road. Speed may be only a secondary factor. All accidents should be investigated to see how the driver contributed to the accident, whether he could have done anything to avoid it and what the general driving population could learn from this accident. To make an impact on accident statistics we must change driver behaviour and attitude. This information could be a very useful tool, as it has been in many other countries.</P>
    <P>Another major issue of concern is young drivers. Judging by the majority of comments on road safety it is perceived that they are the root cause of all accidents. This allows older drivers to abdicate their responsibilities. Nevertheless, the figures showing that 40% of accidents involve young drivers and that by the year's end 100 young people will have been killed in single vehicle accidents, hitting a pole or a wall, highlights this serious problem, yet the Government's road safety strategy virtually ignores this section of the driving population.</P>
    <P>While everyone agrees that better driving skills and behaviour would make an enormous difference to the number of accidents, especially involving young drivers, nobody has been prepared to address the issue except my own party, which published its proposals in August 2000. While it was welcomed by all involved in road safety the only response from the Government was to send a backbench TD out to try to knock holes in it. If the policy was so bad from the Government's perspective, it has had the last 15 months to develop its own policy. Yet the silence is deafening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> There is ample evidence that the way many new drivers learn to drive is unsatisfactory. Too many people are ill-prepared when they take the test and fewer than half the candidates pass the test first time. Even after passing the test young and newly qualified drivers have a poor safety record compared to older and more experienced drivers. Fine Gael is determined to improve the safety record of young drivers and, as a consequence, address the issue of spiralling car insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Every week the State finds that 43% of drivers taking the test are unsuitable to drive, that is 1,394 drivers who are allowed back on the road after they have failed their driving tests. They are not even told what mistakes they are making. How does this improve our safety record? If there was a similar failure rate for the leaving certificate there would be a huge public outcry, yet we are prepared to allow people who have shown that they cannot pass the test to take charge of a potentially lethal weapon, a car. There are a number of reasons the failure rate is so high. A sizeable percentage of driving instructors have themselves never passed the test but are allowed to pass on their bad driving techniques to young drivers. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government turns a blind eye to the regulations for driving instructors.</P>
    <P>Drivers who fail the test are given a results sheet which is little more than double Dutch. They are none the wiser about why they have failed and are therefore unaware of their mistakes. They cannot improve their techniques or ensure that they do not repeat the mistakes on their way home after the test. If a student fails a subject in the leaving certificate he has access to the paper and can review the marking system. We must introduce a driving test report which would highlight the minor faults marked during the test. The idea is to make the driver aware of his weaknesses.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has also proposed the introduction of a log book to give a structured programme for driver training, yet the Government has ignored this issue. Even if a young driver is competent and safe there is no encouragement to take a responsible attitude to driving. The insurance industry ignores responsible young drivers who see their premiums double despite their unblemished records. The current policy of the insurance industry does not promote a safe and responsible attitude from young drivers to road safety. This policy is directly controlled by the insurance industry. The gardaí are going around with one hand tied behind their back in relation to enforcement due to the lack of resources.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister bring forward an amendment to this Bill which overnight would save at least 20 lives per year. I propose that the Bill be amended to introduce daytime running of car lights during the winter period. This has been introduced in Scandinavian countries to great effect and would be of major benefit to this coun<Col N="424" /> try. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has run two pilot projects but they have not yet decided, after four years, whether to proceed with this proposal. This is a simple but significant proposal which would benefit all road users and has been conclusively proven to work, even in this country, through the pilot projects of Donegal County Council, South Dublin County Council and the ESB. I therefore urge the Minister to include this proposal in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is a result of the first road safety strategy produced by this Government. However, it falls far short of what is urgently required and there remain serious question marks over its implementation and enforcement.</P>

      <P>This week saw the publication of the Government's national health strategy. It was a familiar formula. The Taoiseach stood at a presidential style podium and announced the good news.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the road. I was reminded, when I saw the fanfare for the Government's health strategy&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will remind the Deputy about something. It reminded me of the same type of fanfare three and a half years ago when the Taoiseach, using much the same formula, announced the Government's road safety strategy in 1998. When he launched that, in the same style, he told us that the level of road deaths was an unacceptable social problem and that road safety had to be tackled immediately and systematically.</P>
      <P>What did the Taoiseach mean by tackling it immediately? The cornerstone of the strategy was to be legislation introducing a penalty points system for driving offences. According to the road safety strategy that legislation was to be introduced in 1999. This Bill was to have been introduced in 1999 but we are debating it now for the first time. It was not published until March 2001, almost two years after the publication of the Government's road safety strategy. Having been published, it then languished on the Government's legislative list for eight months before it got its first outing in the House yesterday evening. We will be very lucky if this legislation is enacted in the lifetime of this Dáil and it will certainly be well into next year at the earliest before the provisions of the Bill come into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> When those of us who questioned the delay in the publication of the Bill raised this issue at various times we were told that it was very complicated legislation and that a lot of preparatory work had to go into it. That is clearly not the case from the Bill before us. It is a cut and paste job which borrows the penalty points system that applies in other jurisdictions, tidies it up somewhat and adapts it a little to meet our own road safety legislative framework, then inserts it in various sections of the parent legislation. It is difficult to see how it could have taken so long to prepare, publish and debate this legislation if the Government was serious about dealing with road safety as an immediate problem.</P>
    <P>As for the Taoiseach's description of road safety as a matter which had to be tackled systematically, let us look at the record regarding that systematic approach. The road safety strategy set down a systematic blueprint for dealing with traffic offences and road safety issues. The main objective of the road safety strategy, which I welcome and support, was to reduce road deaths and accidents by 20% in 2002 over 1997. Interestingly enough, the strategy, although it set a more ambitious target than the 15% set generally in the European Union, set a target which was significantly less than that suggested by experts to the high level group which drew up the strategy. At the time the strategy was being drawn up, experts were brought from Lancashire, the London metropolitan area and Victoria, Australia, to demonstrate the success they had had in reducing the number of road deaths not by 20% but by 50% in a seven year period. It is interesting that against that background, the more modest target of 20% over five years was chosen.</P>
    <P>However, the delay in bringing in the legislation was not the only missed target in the road safety strategy. Most of the deadlines set in the national road safety strategy have been missed. The establishment of a computerised national driver file, through which the penalty points system will be administered, was to have been completed by the end of 2000 but will not now be ready until well into next year. The random breath testing was to have been introduced in 1999. In the second report on road safety this was changed to 2000 and in the third report was changed again to 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the fourth report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory carrying of a driving licence was to have been introduced in 1999 but that has now been changed to 2001 and will probably have to be moved to 2002. The written theory test section of the driving test was to have been introduced in 1999 but was delayed until 2001 and then introduced only for first time applicants. Provisional licence holders who have taken and failed the driving test have been exempted from the new theory test. A national seatbelt wearing survey, which was supposed to have been introduced in 1998, will not now take <Col N="426" /> place until next year. The national speed survey, which was to have been conducted in 1999, has also been put back until next year. The average waiting time for a driving test was to have been reduced to ten weeks nationally but it has now gone up to 14 weeks again.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 25% of the drivers on the roads are not qualified to drive. They have not passed the driving test, they do not hold a full driving licence and they would not be allowed on the road unaccompanied in most other European countries. Enforcement of existing road safety laws is weak. Of the over 400 deaths on the roads in each of the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, only 12, 15 and 12 cases, respectively, were brought for dangerous driving causing death. The remaining cases were brought for dangerous driving only. The number of drink driving convictions work out at an average of just one per garda per year.</P>
      <P>Those who are wondering today if the Taoiseach and his Government are serious about implementing the national health strategy would do well to examine their record on the national road safety strategy. The road safety strategy is not unconnected to health. The most traumatic admissions to accident and emergency departments in hospitals are from road accidents. The economist Peter Bacon was engaged by the National Safety Council to produce an economic assessment of the road safety strategy. He estimated that the State would save over £500 million by implementing the national road safety strategy and that it would save almost four times the cost of implementing the strategy. Most of the savings would have come in the health services.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the Government, which was so loud in launching and publicising the national road safety strategy, has failed to implement it. Eddie Shaw, chairman of the National Safety Council, has stated: &ldquo;If the strategy had been implemented, people would be walking about now who are dead.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill is before us now because road safety is seasonal. Road safety, breath tests and drink driving advertisements are as much part of the Christmas season as Santa Claus and, like Santa Claus, they disappear again after Christmas. The reality is that road safety is not a priority at all for the Government because it has not implemented its own strategy.</P>
      <P>Page 13 of the national road safety strategy itself states:</P>
      <P>If responsibility for this strategy is seen to rest with Government and public agencies only, then it will fail. Road safety depends critically on public support from individual citizens and from voluntary and other local interests. This shared responsibility for our wider ownership of road safety is a critical success factor for many of the specific policies and measures of this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the National Safety Council, the State agency responsible for promoting road safety, was frustrated by the Minister for the <Col N="427" /> Environment and Local Government when it attempted to give meaning to the theory of localising the road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from a speech given on 27 January 2000 by Mr. Cartan Finegan, the former chairman of the National Safety Council, shortly after his departure from the council. I will quote some sections from the speech which were not widely reported, but which summarise the degree to which the attempt to localise road safety was frustrated:</P>
    <P>A lesson learned from the UK and Australian experience was that community ownership of road safety was essential and that this could best be accomplished through local authorities in recruiting commercial, social and educational involvement in the campaigns. In fact, the road safety strategy document was unequivocal in relation to that. Bringing it down to county level, involving schools, health services, chambers of commerce, etc., particularly the newly elected council, required the organisational resources of a road safety officer in each county to develop a road safety plan, a programme of activities linking in with road engineers and gardaí and national campaigns for road safety. The recommendation by the board of the National Safety Council to Government was that each county would have a full-time safety officer, instead of the existing systems where a designated official allocated approximately two hours per week on the safety function. From extensive consultation with county managers and councillors, it was evident that no new or extended functions would be taken on unless financial resources were provided and the cost benefit analysis had included £1.3 million, to be required over three years, to cover the cost of full-time road safety officers.</P>
    <P>This was the recommendation of the National Safety Council. Mr. Finegan, who was chairman of the council when the national road safety strategy was adopted, continued:</P>
    <P>The recommendation was rejected by the Minister, quoting the ongoing re-organisation of the local authorities and the proposed setting up of special policy committees. A revised recommendation was made, that ten counties as a pilot scheme be set up, but the December budget contained no provision for the necessary funding. There is a definite irony in the fact that 29 counties have full-time and funded arts officers and by the end of this year there will be eleven full-time and funded heritage officers in the counties, notwithstanding the constraints of local authority re-organisation quoted by the Minister. It would be a strange inversion of values if the promotion of arts and heritage ranked over the value of human life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> That is a strong statement, coming from the former chairman of the National Safety Council, describing the degree to which the efforts of the NSC to localise road safety and to get approval from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the appointment of full-time road safety officers in each local authority was frustrated.</P>
    <P>It may be that the location of the road safety function is a problem. It could be argued that it is no longer appropriate to allocate responsibility for road safety to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister may face a conflict in relation to road safety as he is responsible for funding local authorities, which are responsible for physical road safety measures and infrastructure, including the sometimes rushed construction of roads. Such matters seem to be taking precedence over road safety. The National Roads Authority has also been given a road safety function, despite the fact that its primary role is the building of roads and the reduction of journey times on major national roads.</P>
    <P>I wish to give an example of such conflict in my constituency. A roundabout outside Loughlinstown Hospital links the Bray-Shankill bypass which will eventually be part of the M50 motorway, the N11, the road serving Shankill village and the road into the hospital. The staff and management of the hospital have asked for many years that traffic lights be placed at the roundabout, so vehicles exiting the hospital can safely enter the flow of traffic. It is impossible to leave the hospital grounds at peak times, for example, during the morning rush hour. The request of the hospital authorities was supported by the local authority, which asked the NRA to provide traffic lights. The NRA refused to make such a provision, however, arguing that its job is to increase and improve the flow of traffic. It is a straightforward conflict. The National Roads Authority sees its role as facilitating the quickest possible flow of traffic through the roundabout and on to the N11. It is not in the least concerned about how long it takes for a doctor, nurse, ambulance or patient to get in and out of the hospital.</P>
    <P>If we are to be serious about road safety, the time has come to give responsibility for the problem to a dedicated single State agency. There is an argument that the agency should be the National Safety Council. Following a recent report by consultants, we were told that the Minister intends to establish an agency with responsibility for driver testing. It does not make sense to me that one agency will be responsible for the promotion of road safety, another will be responsible for the driving test, another will be responsible for collecting road tax and the Department of the Environment and Local Government will be responsible, in theory, for the provision of resources to implement the road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>There is an argument for giving responsibility for all aspects of road safety and driver behaviour, comprising everything from the issuing of <Col N="429" /> driving licences to the funding of road safety measures, to a single State agency. I believe, furthermore, that such an agency should be accountable to the Minister for Health and Children, not to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who has many responsibilities in this area. A connection needs to be made between road safety expenditure and health expenditure, especially in hospital accident and emergency wards, which will decline if road safety measures are successful. The case is supported by the assessment in Peter Bacon's report, which outlined the huge financial cost of road accidents and deaths. The full implementation of the road safety strategy, which needs increased expenditure, would lead to a reduction in the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads. This, in turn, could lead to huge savings in health and hospital budgets. Road safety should be seen as a function of the Department of Health and Children rather than a matter merely associated with roads and infrastructure, as has been the case.</P>
    <P>Road safety is not a financial issue, but a human one. Nobody can put a value on the lives lost on our roads or on the human suffering which results. It is clear that we have an enforcement problem even of existing road safety legislation. We are now creating a new raft of such legislation which introduces new offences when the existing road safety legislation is only being implemented and enforced on a haphazard basis. I quote from a letter received by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, from the Campaign Against Dangerous and Drunken Driving:</P>
    <P>As you know, there are two separate charges. (1) Dangerous driving only, brought in the District Court and (2) dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm, brought in the Circuit Criminal Court. The whole problem is that the Director of Public Prosecutions brings charges of dangerous driving in the District Court where the culprit kills or seriously injures an innocent victim. The charge of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm should be brought instead in the Circuit Court. Of the 400+ deaths on the roads, only 12 cases in 1997, 15 in 1998 and 12 in 1999 were brought for dangerous driving causing death in the Circuit Court. The remaining 380+ cases went to the District Court under the charge of dangerous driving only. The result of this scandal was that the culprit who killed or seriously injured a person gets off with a fine of usually about £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Garda has numerous responsibilities and a huge workload in terms of policing the increasingly difficult society in which we live. It simply does not have sufficient resources to fully enforce road traffic laws. Until such time as a dedicated traffic corps is created within the Garda Síochána or a separate traffic police force is established, we will not see full enforcement in this area.</P>
    <P>I generally support this Bill although there are issues which it should have addressed. A great <Col N="430" /> deal of emphasis is placed on drink driving. There is a widespread problem of illegal recreational drug use, particularly cannabis, in this country and our road safety legislation should address that. The road safety strategy refers to research into the effects of recreational drugs other than alcohol on drivers and these should be specifically addressed in the legislation. Significant numbers of people under the influence of these drugs drive motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>We need to reduce speed limits, particularly in urban areas where the current speed limit is 30 miles per hour. A provision should be included in the Bill whereby local authorities can, in urban areas or housing estates, introduce speed limits significantly lower than this to reduce traffic to a crawl in housing estates or near schools. We must address the problem of end-of-life vehicles, an issue I have raised on a number of occasions during Question Time, which contribute to road safety problems in so far as vehicles which do not pass the NCT are being driven around housing estates by joyriders at nights and weekends and are eventually burned out in the corner of a field. We must also address joyriding itself. My colleague, Deputy Broughan, introduced a Bill some time ago on this matter and I would like to see its provisions incorporated into this road safety legislation. Cycle ways have been developed in Dublin and some other urban areas and, while I welcome their introduction, we must address the issue of cyclists who put pedestrians at risk.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this legislation must be examined. This Bill proposes the introduction of a regime under which a garda will be able to issue on-the-spot fines and penalties for motoring offences. The legislation will confer significant additional powers on the gardaí. I strongly support the Garda Síochána which has served this country very well and which has a difficult job to do. Only last week, allegations of Garda abuse were made in this House. We must introduce a mechanism to ensure that any abuses of the powers which this Bill will confer on gardaí, however limited, can be dealt with. As it stands, a person who commits a traffic offence is charged and brought before the courts. However, under the new regime, a garda will be able to impose a one point penalty on a motorist whose left indicator does not work, for example. Once 12 points are accumulated, a person loses his or her licence for six months. The House must address any potential for the abuse of these powers during the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I propose to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage on behalf of the Labour Party seeking the inclusion of the measures and desired improvements to which I have referred. The Labour Party generally supports this Bill but I regret that the road safety strategy on which it was built has not been implemented with the same enthusiasm as it was launched. Road safety should be given a much higher priority by the Government than is evident from the delay in introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>Not everyone who travels on our roads on a daily basis does so in a safe manner. Gardaí are also victims of road fatalities. Only a couple of months ago, two gardaí in Cork lost their lives in the line of duty. Our thoughts are with the families of Garda Rice and Garda McIntyre this evening.</P>
      <P>Irish roads claimed the lives of 1,415 people during 2000 and to date this year 362 fatalities have been recorded. Driving on public roads is a social freedom but also a social responsibility. More than 26,000 people died in road accidents in the last century and for every death on the road there have been many serious injuries, some of which result in lifelong disability and reduced quality of life.</P>
      <P>Road vehicle travel in Ireland will have almost doubled by the end of the year 2001, compared with 1990. The strong growth in road transport is putting pressure on road safety, and road accident figures have been rising. Increased road travel is unavoidable, at least in the short term. The key to improved road safety in these circumstances is the systematic reduction of risk factors. International experience shows that a reduction in the number of road accidents can be most quickly achieved by targeting human behaviour. At present, about 40% of Irish cars and heavy goods vehicles drive in breach of the principal speed limits. Our rate of seat belt wearing is well behind international best practice and despite a welcome change in social attitudes alcohol is still a major factor in road accidents. Surveys have shown that the Irish public have a high level of concern about road safety and are generally supportive of action to improve it but, on the other hand, fewer than 2% of Irish drivers consider that their driving is dangerous compared with others &ndash; 57% believe they drive more safely than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland needs to be more serious about its road safety performance. We stand at mid-division in comparative EU terms and have been falling behind EU best practice. The time has come to adopt a more proactive and precautionary approach to road safety in Ireland. The requirements of efficient transport and the convenience of our social lives cannot be allowed to dominate road safety policy. We need to relate road safety to issues of health and security so that the various restrictions and disciplines imposed by road <Col N="432" /> traffic regulations are contributing positively to a safer Irish society.</P>
    <P>Apart from reducing road deaths and serious injuries, other benefits of a systematic strategy will include the freeing up of many acute hospital beds, reducing demands on our courts system and health and environmental benefits through increased walking and cycling. Economic and employment benefits are associated with more efficient road freight and other vehicular traffic, quality of life benefits exist in affording personal mobility to young and older people and smaller cars and motorcycles offer consumer benefits. The strategy will lead to a more friendly road and street environment.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective is to provide a safe, efficient and cost effective movement of persons and goods by road. There are many initiatives in place, including the Government's road to safety strategy. The Government wants to reduce deaths and serious injuries from road accidents by at least 20%. If the strategy succeeds &ndash; the Government and the road safety agencies are determined it should &ndash; 172 lives could be saved in the year 2002. The strategy specifies a set of policies and measures to improve human behaviour on our roads and to make roads and vehicles safer to support the achievement of this target.</P>
    <P>Achieving the strategy's ambitious target will place heavy demands on our implementing agencies &ndash; the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council, local authorities and others. They all support the strategy and are strongly committed to delivering on it. Major gains in road safety are achievable in Ireland as elsewhere by concerted efforts in the areas of speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. The strategy will prioritise these three areas by new initiatives and the intensification of existing instruments and measures.</P>
    <P>The Bill will extensively improve enforcement arrangements for road traffic offences. In particular, it provides for a system of penalty points which will trigger automatic disqualification from driving on the accumulation of points on a person's driving licence. The accumulation of penalty points will lead to the loss of a driver's licence. These will be the new facts of life for motorists. From now on, run-of-the-mill carelessness and lack of consideration in relation to safe driving will have the potential result of disqualification from driving.</P>
    <P>The Bill also extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen to include circumstances where a driver is involved in a road accident or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>The Government is the first to prepare and adopt a national road safety strategy. I am not aware of a previous Government doing so, although we heard Deputy Naughten pontificating about what should and should not happen. <Col N="433" /> I commend the Government on introducing the national road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>The Bill supplies the substantive legislative measure promised under the strategy to support the road safety agencies to continue to strive for a reduced toll of fatalities and serious injuries. I am confident that we can improve Irish road safety performance to the targets set out in the Government's strategy and progressively go beyond these.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support the development and introduction of new vehicle safety measures at EU level and will press for their implementation at the earliest possible date. These measures include mandatory fitting of anti-lock brakes to a wider range of vehicles, including all coaches and trucks, truck-towing trailers etc.; wider application of the requirement to fit speed limitation devices; and better safety belt standards, including more use of three point belts. At national level, practical measures to be taken will include the fitting of suppression devices to heavy goods vehicles; increased use of child restraints; enhancing school bus safety; the use of daytime running lights, as was mentioned by Deputy Naughten; the revision of the national regulations dealing with the construction, equipment and use of vehicles to take account of various technical developments in the field of primary and secondary safety; a wider and more effective use of speed limitation devices; and improved standards for tyres, mirrors, lights and signalling equipment. All these measures will contribute to road safety.</P>
    <P>Other measures will include the upgrading of Garda and other IT systems relevant to enforcement; the extended use of automatic speed detection systems, mobile and fixed; the active deployment of ice detection monitoring systems by the NRA; support for the application of developments in the field of telematics to road safety. All these functions, if introduced, will help to reduce accidents and improve road safety.</P>
    <P>Young road users need to be educated in road safety to develop the knowledge and attitudes which lead to responsible behaviour on the roads. This process includes action by parents, school-based programmes and novice driver training. Education and information in relation to road safety is being improved, including joint promotional campaigns with the Northern Ireland authorities. We must upgrade resource material for input to the primary school curriculum because children are a vulnerable category of road user. New material and programmes for the post-primary sector are vitally important for all adolescents. Awareness campaigns on speeding, drink driving, drugs and seat belt wearing, with specific emphasis on the wearing of seat belts on both short and long journeys, will be continued.</P>
    <P>The recent introduction of the driver theory test will supplement the long-standing practical driving test and will encourage a deeper and more structured understanding by novice drivers of information and behaviours which will assist them to become safer drivers. The test, which <Col N="434" /> covers matters such as the rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviours, is being conducted at a nationwide network of 41 test locations. The obligation to do the theory test applies to everyone applying for a first provisional licence on or after 25 April 2001. Effective training and education of novice drivers is important in influencing driver behaviour. The introduction of the driving theory test is a significant development in the education of our learner drivers and should increasingly be reflected over time.</P>
    <P>Research plays a vital role in developing road safety programmes and policies. Research will provide the foundation for a new generation of road safety measures and will ensure that the road safety effort is not misdirected into ineffectual strategies. A well focused research effort is required to support the Government's targets. Through comprehensive and well resourced research a more thorough understanding will be available of the causes and consequences of road crashes, the effect of existing counter measures in reducing the number and severity of road crashes and the likely effect of potential counter measures in reducing the number and severity of road crashes in the future. A better understanding of these factors will assist in identifying and targeting high risk and high incidence groups.</P>
    <P>Drink driving continues to be a national problem that tragically affects thousands of victims and their families on an annual basis. Every injury and death caused by drink driving is preventable but, unfortunately, a frightening percentage of all traffic fatalities is caused by drunk drivers. It is easy to forget that dry statistics represent real people and real lives.</P>
    <P>Like most other social problems, drink driving resists simple solutions. Increasing the cost of alcohol would have virtually no impact. Research and common sense suggests that heavy drinkers are not deterred by cost while increasing it would tend to discriminate against lower income consumers and create other problems of unknown magnitude. Rather than putting resources into laws that fail to address the real problem, we need to enforce the existing laws and proven policies that have demonstrated a significant impact. If we want to save lives we must go after the dangerous drivers on the roads.</P>
    <P>Improved roads and vehicles can contribute significantly to motor safety. Technological initiatives in the United States include raised lane markers, which are easier to see and emit a startling sound when a tyre goes over them. Corrugations along the edges of roads emit sounds when driven over. These are installed on parts of our motorways, thus alerting inattentive drivers to their inappropriate location. Wider roads, improved street and motorway lighting, breakaway signposts, brake lights positioned at eye level, door crash barriers and many other improvements can save lives and are cost effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The preliminary findings of the drugs research bureau on road safety underlines that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of growing concern. The identification of the presence of drugs is, however, more complex than in the case of alcohol. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is continually undertaking informative programmes of drug analysis. In one submission of blood and urine samples under the legal alcohol limit submitted to the bureau between 1 July and 31 December 1999, 37% of those tested were screened positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis. When all national and international research has been completed in this area it will point to the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possible changes to legislation. It is already illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to the extent of being incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry says accident statistics do not favour the argument that insurance premiums for young drivers are too high. A recent report by Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluated insurance costs in Ireland and found that the average cost of an insurance claim for claimants aged 17 to 24 years was twice as high as the average cost of a claim for those aged 36 to 40. I am concerned about rising motor insurance costs, especially in the young driver category. Anybody who runs a constituency clinic or is in contact with young people must realise that they are angry at the exorbitant cost of motor insurance. Young people who educate themselves to take their rightful place in the workforce for the first time should also have the right to pay equal insurance premiums but they find it increasingly difficult to do so. In some cases the cost of insurance is greater than the cost of the vehicle they have purchased to travel to and from work.</P>
    <P>In devising effective policies and programmes to reduce the cost of insurance, it is necessary to identify the key factors contributing to the high cost of liability and motor insurance. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has found that the main factors include the high delivery cost of personal injury claims, including legal costs, the high level of medical inflation and the disproportionately high awards of general damages in smaller personal injury claims. The cost of delivering compensation has a major bearing on the premium rate ultimately charged in the marketplace. This needs to be looked at by the Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the evidence that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance must be to reduce the frequency of accidents and the associated costs of claims. Unfortunately, many of our accidents on Irish roads involve young drivers and take place mainly between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. This speaks for itself. It appears that many young drivers who <Col N="436" /> are out late at night are tired when travelling home and are unable to concentrate in the early hours of the morning. This is a major cause of many accidents. It brings much tragedy to families when they discover that a son or daughter has lost their life due to a tragic accident.</P>
    <P>At my instigation, in the past 12 months the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport has considered the cost of insurance and its effect on young drivers. The chairman of the committee, Deputy Callely, took a deep interest in the matter. The committee sat for many hours. It invited representatives from the insurance companies and many of the drivers' groups to attend hearings. A delegation from the traffic division at Garda Headquarters also attended and provided the committee with the statistics I outlined earlier, with confirmation that the vast majority of fatalities involve young drivers.</P>
    <P>To secure lower premiums we must mobilise support from private citizens, voluntary and other local interests, local authorities and the insurance, motor, drinks and telecommunications industries. Multi-agency co-operation is also essential and there must be a vigorous commitment to the implementation of policies and strategies. If all these groups become involved and work together it will help to reduce the levels of fatalities on the roads.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of experienced road users could be improved through an ongoing series of co-ordinated public information campaigns. No Government has gone as far as this one in terms of policy development, national funding and the promotion of legislation on road safety. Drivers should go the extra mile in terms of addressing safety as a personal priority. They should never drink and drive, never drive under the influence of drugs and, for all our sakes, they should slow down. If they are old enough to drive they are old enough to drive responsibly. Responsible driving is a matter of life and death &ndash; the lives of the driver, passengers and other road users are at stake.</P>
    <P>I commend the gardaí, especially in Cork, for their strict enforcement of the road traffic laws. Because of their extra vigilance there has been a reduction in the number of traffic offences in Cork. There was an element of Garda bashing last week and this week. I fully support the gardaí for the work they do on behalf of the citizens under very serious conditions. I do not wish to be associated with the Garda bashing in the media over the past seven days. I support the gardaí entirely.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. Like others, I believe it will be useful if it can be implemented. We can spend endless hours introducing new legislation but irrespective of how <Col N="437" /> good it is, if it cannot be implemented it will be useless.</P>
      <P>Action must be taken in this area. The level of atrocities caused by accidents on our roads is shocking. Hardly a night goes by without a news item on television showing a most appalling accident. The accidents are so bad it is almost impossible to know the types of vehicle involved. When accidents happened in the past one would at least know there were two cars or whatever involved, but the impacts are now so dramatic nobody could possibly survive. The multiple death accidents are horrendous, and if this Bill addresses that then I support it 100%. There have always been blind spots in road traffic legislation and I am sure the same can be said of this Bill. However, we should at least give it a try. I do not believe we will solve the problem over night &ndash; it would be impossible to do so &ndash; but there are some provisions in the Bill which I hope will work.</P>
      <P>I believe everybody sees drink driving as a major problem, which it is, but speeding is worse. I cannot understand why, in a country with speed limits of 60 and 70 miles per hour, one of the attractions that sells cars is that they can reach a speed of 130 miles per hour. We cannot but have problems when one of those high powered cars is put in the possession of a young person who wants to test it &ndash; we were all young once and liked to drive fast cars. I assume there is no point in reducing the horse power of cars, but we are facing a head wind before we start in the sense that every time a new car comes on the market it has a higher power than the previous model. Speed is a killer. People talk about the need for better quality tyres and ABS brakes, and they are hugely important, but an extra eighth of an inch or quarter of an inch of rubber, or a particular type of brake or suspension will make little difference when high powered cars travel at speed. I am not suggesting, however, that cars should not have good tyres.</P>
      <P>There is a psychological aspect to driving offences. There is always a carrot and stick approach in terms of road traffic legislation. A clean driving licence will reflect itself in insurance premia, for example. I am not an expert, but one of the great strokes are traffic speeding cameras which will put manners on thousands of motorists. Those cameras can track hundreds of cars in a very short time, and if enough people have to pay a £50 fine or accumulate penalty points, they will soon realise they are foolish to break speed limits. Like every other politician, I travel a great deal throughout the country and I see more of those cameras in use. I admit I have been the victim of one of them, and having paid a fine of £50 I assure the House I will remember the speed limit in future. I assume the psychology works the same for everybody. Cameras are mechanical, and I understand they meet constitutional requirements. It is a matter of manpower and funding being invested in them. I assume all Garda divisions will shortly have access to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> I do not know how useful penalty points will be, but they appear to be a worthwhile system. I am concerned that many countries in Europe with a lower level of traffic accidents do not use that system. I am sure the Minister has given much thought to this over the years and perhaps he will indicate why other European countries have not taken the penalty points route. The Minister mentioned the countries which use the system, including the UK and Australia, and it would appear they have a very positive effect in terms of reducing traffic accidents.</P>
    <P>There will be much talk about the administration involved in operating a penalty points system. I am told there will be huge administrative difficulties, and I hope gardaí are not taken from other very important duties to operate the system. I assume this has been thought out as this is an integrated approach which will not have the necessary effect if we do not fire on all cylinders.</P>
    <P>One must question why, given all the talk and the television advertising, 50% of people still travel in cars without wearing seat belts. I find this astonishing. One has only to look around at the lanes of traffic coming into this city in the morning to realise that 50% of people do not wear their seat belts. I assume the penalty points system will work very well in that regard and that those who are spotted not wearing one will accumulate one point. Those who accumulate 12 points will not need a safety belt for the following six months as they will be disqualified, and that will be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I have never seen such striking advertisements on television portraying the worst effects of drinking and driving. They are a tribute to the advertising skills of the people who make them. The advertisement in which the drunk driver crashes into a front garden killing a child gives me the shivers. However, for whatever reason, the majority of people take no notice of it after seeing it once or twice. I do not know why that is so as that advertisement is awful.

      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill. Perhaps the media advertising for cars should be accompanied by a health warning, as in the case of cigarette advertising. Media advertising for the sale of cars is highly glamorised, often featuring high powered fast cars driven by young people. The major car companies have a big responsibility in this regard. Their financial deals are very much geared towards young drivers. The current road safety advertising campaign in the media is very effective, particularly on RTE 1. The increased powers which this Bill provides for the Garda are important and I hope it will be enacted as quickly as possible. There should be a special task force in each Garda district to deal with traffic matters. Every road accident is one too many. The impact on families, relations and friends is an experience they will never forget.</P>
      <P>A ban on the use of mobile phones while people are driving cars should be considered. The incidence of that dangerous practice appears to be on the increase. Driver error resulting from loss of concentration is another significant cause of accidents and the problem is compounded by the use of high speed cars. The introduction of the theory test as a requirement for the issue of a driving licence is a welcome move. Uninsured driving is a major concern and there should be an obligation on the insurance companies to provide all available information in that regard to the gardaí. A penalty points system is overdue. The equation of 12 penalty points over a three year period with a six months ban should provide an effective deterrent against road traffic offences. Some 68 offences, with penalty points attached, are listed under the Road Traffic Bill. The enactment of the Bill should be followed up with a media campaign so that everybody is fully aware of the situation. The wearing of seat belts should be more rigorously enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With half a million additional cars now on the road and with the emphasis in the national development plan on the improvement of the national roads structure, there is a greater need than ever before to concentrate greater efforts on road safety. The Garda Commissioner has described the incidence of drink driving as appalling and shameful. Approximately 1,000 arrests per month are made for drink driving <Col N="440" /> offences, amounting to over 37,000 since 1997. That is an outrageous and alarming figure and it underlines the need for much more rigorous enforcement. Regardless of the level of resources and legislative measures which are applied, the situation will only improve significantly if we can succeed in changing attitudes and behaviour of road users. Many road accidents occur after midnight and a considerable proportion involve driver only cars. A combination of high speeds and excessive alcohol consumption are clearly major contributory factors.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue. Although the Minister has referred to a reduction of 18 in the number of road deaths for this year to date, the figures are still far higher than the <i>pro rata</i> figures for the UK. I know the Garda already have a heavy schedule of work but, where over 300 people have lost their lives this year on the roads, with enormous consequences for thousands of families, greater enforcement of the existing road traffic legislation must be a high priority. There should be a major campaign on the drink driving issue with a long period of disqualification for offenders. Every life saved is well worthwhile. On the spot fines are very effective. There should be a greater investment in automated speed-check cameras, not only on national roads but also on class 3 roads. Such cameras have been very effective in the UK and the Minister should consider allocating a special budget for their widespread installation in this country. If there are appropriately severe penalties, that system will be effective in curbing excessive speeds. Automated cameras are more effective than manual speed checks by the gardaí, which are often counteracted by the practice of drivers warning each other of speed checks ahead. That is a regrettable tactic but it is all too commonplace. There should be an education programme on road safety, aimed at young drivers, through second and third level educational institutions.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue and I urge the Minister to implement its provisions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The changeover to the euro next January will involve considerable effort in adapting and becoming accustomed to the new currency. The provisions of this Bill are probably no less far-reaching in their potential effects as the vast majority of people are either car owners or drivers or have access to the use of a car or other road vehicle. The primary focus of the Road Traffic Acts is to provide a legislative basis for the safety of the nation's road network. It is a laudable and important goal when one considers the number of people, particularly young people, who die on our roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives pleasure to no Member on this side of the House to have to speak on a motion to defend the good name of a colleague. I am delighted Deputy Gildea is in the House this evening and I hope he will take this opportunity to make a full statement on the reason he made such scurrilous allegations last week. Last Wednesday he said that when Deputy Owen was Minister for Justice, &ldquo;. . . a force of up to 100 gardaí was amassed for use against the local law abiding rural population of Ardara &ndash; Glenties area. . . . The Garda Síochána in County Donegal was subjected to unacceptable pressure by her.&rdquo; He requested that Deputy Owen be fully investigated because &ldquo;as the enthusiastic and willing <Col N="442" /> handmaiden of Cable Management Ireland, she received financial remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement crossed the Rubicon of what Dáil privilege is about. I cannot understand how a Deputy could make such allegations without a scintilla of evidence or truth. The statement was scurrilous and defamed the good name of my colleague, Deputy Owen. I hope Deputy Gildea will take the opportunity this evening to clarify the reasons for his outrageous comments. To use the privilege of the House in such a fashion is an abuse of the privilege which Members of the Oireachtas enjoy. It is a privilege we should protect and respect.</P>
      <P>A Rubicon was crossed last week when Deputy Gildea made his accusations. What is to stop me making an allegation of bribery against any member of the Government without any evidence to support it? The Taoiseach has failed to consider the enormity of what took place in the Dáil last week. When serious charges of misconduct were made against the Taoiseach by an individual, who claimed to have given the Taoiseach money in a car park, the Taoiseach had the opportunity to clear his name through the judicial system. Unfortunately, no such avenue is available to Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>I cannot help thinking that Deputy Gildea's speech was a diversionary tactic used by the Government to deflect attention from the debate taking place on the McBrearty affair. Many serious issues were raised in the House last week but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform failed to answer them. When he spoke in the House last night, he again failed to respond to the Opposition's questions.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat the questions I put to the Minister last week even though I do not know when he will take the opportunity to answer them. Can the Minister tell the House why an exhumation order for Richard Barron's body was sought from his office by the Donegal coroner, following an application from the garda on 10 October 1997? Why did the garda on 16 October 1997 request the exhumation order to be put on hold? What senior member of An Garda Síochána requested the exhumation order to be put on hold and what were the reasons for that request? Did the Minister not find this request unusual? Why did it take him over four and a half years to investigate it? Why did he sit on his hands and not investigate it in the meantime?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister also confirm that a number of gardaí, who were suspects for wrongdoing in the initial investigation of Richard Barron's death in 1996, were reactivated into the Carty team to participate in his investigation process in 1999? Why was this allowed to happen? When serious allegations of misconduct are made against members of An Garda Síochána it is vital that such allegations are fully and properly investigated within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's unwillingness to answer any of these questions gives credence to the view that he is presiding over a cover up within An Garda <Col N="443" /> Síochána. If he has any respect for the office he holds or seeks to have the reputation of An Garda Síochána restored to its rightful place of respect and esteem in our society, he should immediately agree to the establishment of a public inquiry to investigate the McBrearty affair.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this serious debate. I am very much aware of the happenings prior to tonight's debate. I know both people well. Deputy Owen is a member of my party and has given sterling service to that party. She is someone I have come to admire. I got to know Deputy Gildea when I was elected to the Seanad in 1997. I knew him as a man who went about his business in a shy, calm way. He was elected because people in his constituency felt strongly about a particular issue.</P>
      <P>The person I heard last Wednesday night was not the Thomas Gildea I knew, the man I saw working hard for his constituents and who went calmly about his business each week in Leinster House. The outburst was totally out of character with that Thomas Gildea. However, as Deputy Blaney pointed out last night, Deputy Gildea acted out of frustration. That says it all, that a Deputy has to resort to making such statements to have notice taken of what he is saying.</P>
      <P>Who prompted the Deputy to make that statement? What prompted him to cause so much pain and hardship to a Member of this House, to a person who has given her life to politics and who has given sterling service as Minister for Justice? Somebody must be behind that outburst. Members of the public do not elect Deputies to Dáil Éireann to slag other Members and they are getting increasingly frustrated with politics and how politicians behave.</P>
      <P>Politicians have a duty to represent their constituents in a responsible way. Since becoming a Member of this House, I have become extremely familiar with the spin doctoring that takes place. People are not allowed to be themselves. Week after week Ministers come to the House to say that everything is well and that people are perfectly happy with what they are doing. That is not the reality. As politicians we have a responsibility to act in a more honest and decent way.</P>

I have difficulty in accepting the insinuation by Fine Gael that he was prompted by somebody. The Leader of the Opposition made the allegation that Fianna Fáil was responsible for the comments he made. That is an equally outrageous accusation.

God knows there have been times when all of us here may have gone a little too far and we do nothing to enhance the profession of politics when we do that. There are rules and there are limits and Deputy Gildea transgressed these limits and that is not in dispute. However, he has withdrawn the remarks and he has apologised. This motion ignores this simple and central point. We are really now debating not the question of the withdrawal of the remarks or the apology but the grammar that was used. The debate is about an unwarranted allegation made against Deputy Owen. It was wrong and this is admitted. I have the greatest respect for Deputy Owen and I am certain she has a level of integrity that matches anyone on any side of this House.

We have learned some lessons from all of this and I am sure Deputy Gildea regrets as much as we do on this side of the House that these unwarranted remarks were made. This House, including Deputy Owen, is entitled to a fulsome apology for what took place.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Last Wednesday night, Deputy Gildea made unfounded and baseless allegations against Deputy Owen. The comments made were disgraceful and I sympathise with Deputy Owen <Col N="447" /> for the hurt and humiliation she has suffered as a result. I know Deputy Owen since 1985 when we were both elected to Dublin County Council and in those 16 years I have known Deputy Owen as a friend and as a dedicated public representative. I felt for Deputy Owen on Wednesday night last and during the week that has just gone by. I would not wish what happened to Deputy Owen on my worst enemy. I am sure Deputy Gildea has also gone through a traumatic week. I would like to hear Deputy Gildea make a fulsome apology to Deputy Owen. I believe such an apology would lift a great burden from both Deputy Owen and Deputy Gildea. The rough party political debate of last night, which continues tonight is not conducive to an immediate resolution of this situation, where the personal sensibilities of two of our colleagues, and Deputy Owen in particular, have been so affected. From time to time in the House things are said that can cause insult and grief to individuals and embarrassment to all the Members, and this was such an occasion.</P>
      <P>Of course it demands immediate retraction and apology. This particular attack was exacerbated by the fact that Deputy Owen was not in the Chamber when the offence was caused and could not immediately refute the unfounded allegations made against her. Everybody, both inside and outside the House, realises that these allegations are totally unfounded.</P>
      <P>For a long time Deputy Owen has been a respected Member of this House, as a Minister in Government and a Member of the Opposition. While I accept and deeply regret that she has suffered personally in a serious way, I do not believe that Deputy Owen's solid reputation can be damaged by the spurious allegations that were made on Wednesday night last.</P>
      <P>It has been a tradition in this House that when allegations such as these are made against another Member, a withdrawal and apology are deemed sufficient to clear the matter. The notice of censure of Deputy Gildea is only giving further media attention to what is already a ridiculous allegation. I believe the moving of this motion of censure is worsening the situation for Deputy Owen, by giving legs to the false allegations that were made. This motion is allowing the pain and soreness that Deputy Owen in particular is experiencing to fester. The matter is also continuing to reflect badly on all of the Members of this House. The sooner this matter is dealt with the better, for Deputy Owen, Deputy Gildea and for all Deputies.</P>
      <P>Experience is a great teacher in life and I am sure Deputy Owen has been through a number of comparable experiences &ndash; though not quite so personal &ndash; during her political career. On the other hand, Deputy Gildea's experience in the House is not as complete as that of many other Members. I do not wish in any way to trivialise such a serious matter but in sporting terms this outburst could be considered a rush of blood to the head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> Very often the perpetrator of such outbursts suffers nearly as much as the offended party. Deputy Gildea has apologised to Deputy Owen in the House and he has withdrawn all allegations. Just as giving is more fulfilling than receiving, the quality of forgiveness is a great Christian quality and one we would always expect in a person of such experience and graciousness as Deputy Nora Owen. To err is human, to forgive divine. I ask her to adopt the divine mode and forgive what was an unacceptable, emotional and completely inappropriate outburst.</P>

      <P>My apologies Deputy Shatter. I totally reject the allegations as made by Deputy Gildea and I urge Deputy Owen and the proposers of the censure motion to show their qualities of forgiveness and accept the amendment as tabled. It would benefit all Members to put this very regrettable incident behind us.</P>
      <P>In the course of my four and a half years in Dáil Éireann, I have been struck by the readiness of some Members to accuse and indict their colleague Members for minor indiscretions. In the history of complaints to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Public Offices Commission it is apparent that the underlying reason is to embarrass the political party to which the person who is complained about belongs or to which they are affiliated. This party embarrassment seems to take precedence over the substance matter of an accusation. The person who is accused and their feelings and good name seem to come very far down the order of importance.</P>
      <P>Where is the collegiality? Where is the loyalty to colleagues? Is party political expediency so supreme that we do not care who we damage or how much we damage our own colleagues? I am not saying we should turn a blind eye on activities that are contrary to law or the accepted rules and procedures of the House, but I am saying that before we condemn our colleagues we should consider in our own hearts if we are going over the top in the sanctions demanded for the magnitude of the alleged wrong that was committed.</P>

      <P>I do not condone the content or the manner in which the statements were made here by my colleague, Deputy Gildea, last Wednesday evening. I believe Deputy Owen to be a hard working politician and a decent person. I know Deputy Gildea for the past three years and he is also a hard working politician and a decent person.</P>
      <P>Aside from the serious nature of the comments which were made in this particular case, it is never pleasant for a person to hear negative and personal comments made about themselves from the floor of this House, no matter how trivial they may seem to others or to those who make the comments. It is unacceptable that comments of a personal nature should be made from the floor of this House about any Member. Not alone is it unfair to the Member involved, but it lowers the standards of the House.</P>
      <P>As one of the four Independent TDs who support the current Government, I have taken my fair share of negative comments from the floor of the House. I admit that some of it is fair criticism while more of it is probably a play to the gallery to get the Independents to vote a particular way on a particular issue. On a number of occasions, however, I feel that comments have gone above and beyond that. It has been stated by Members of the Opposition that Independent Deputies have been bought. It seems to have conveniently slipped the mind of the Opposition that the rainbow coalition tried to negotiate a deal with the Independents four and a half years ago. It now constantly criticises us for doing with others what it wanted us to do with it &ndash; to support a stable Government.</P>
      <P>The Opposition elevates the Independents to kingmakers one week and then relegates them to the status of simpletons the following week, of being incapable of grasping a particular amendment or having the import of a particular argument lost on us. These constant references to Independents are not serious enough to warrant a response but just because they go unchallenged on a weekly basis does not mean they go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion of censure of Deputy Gildea I am going to do what only a small number of speakers have done so far in this debate, that is to speak about the motion itself. Last night I listened to the debate with interest and pondered whether this motion was to censure Deputy Gildea, whether it was a re-run of last week's Private Members' Business or a motion to censure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Last Thursday morning on the Order of Business, Deputy Noonan made a strong case that the time to deal with the comments made by Deputy Gildea was that very day. He had a point when he said that it would not be possible to repair the damage if false allegations were allowed to be made over the following five or six days without rebuttal. He said he wanted Deputy Owen's name vindicated in the House that day. He also said he wanted a platform to allow Deputy Gildea to come back in to this House and do more than the technical withdrawal indulged in the previous night. He said it was an extremely serious issue and went on to say that it was extremely damaging to Deputy Owen and that it was insufficient to say it would be rectified in due course and must be done that day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gildea acceded to this request. He rose to his feet and clarified that he had withdrawn the remark the previous evening and went on to apologise for the hurt caused to Deputy Owen and to her party. This apology was carried on RTE news bulletins throughout the day.</P>
    <P>I believe this apology was genuine and, while it does not turn back the clock on what has been said, it was an attempt to repair the damage caused. Why do we have this motion tonight which, if successful, could change how these matters are dealt with in the House. There is a long standing precedent in the House on how to deal with serious allegations such as those made by Deputy Gildea. The Ceann Comhairle asks the speaker to withdraw the offending remark and if the speaker does not do so the matter can then be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It should not be up to us to change the rules as we go along. If we are not not happy with the system, perhaps it should be changed, but it should be changed only following calm consideration and not as a knee-jerk reaction to a comment. Deputy Gildea withdrew his allegations and did not partly withdraw or half withdraw them. These allegations undoubtedly attracted unwarranted media attention to Deputies Owen and Gildea. However, the Opposition has succeeded in exposing and prolonging this issue for longer than is necessary.</P>

      <P>A censure motion is appropriate only if a Deputy does not withdraw his or her alle<Col N="451" /> gations. That is clearly not the case in this instance.

However, after everything that was said, Deputy Gildea withdrew the remarks and he immediately apologised to Deputy Owen.

      <P>I wish to set out for Deputy Gildea the sequence of events as they unfolded over the past few days. First, all the Fianna Fáil Members came forward and apologised as best they could. They went over the same ground repeatedly and attempted to apologise on behalf of a colleague who had supported them from the Independent benches in the past four years. They extolled his virtues and appealed for a full and abject apology. That appeal was made again and again last night without success. I have not been in the House as long as some Members but I have learned a golden rule. If one attacks the character of another Member under privilege one must substantiate the allegation or make a total and abject apology. If Deputy Gildea does not have the guts to make such an apology a new standard will be set for the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>One may intend to live by the sword but, unfortunately, history has taught all of us that the sword is double edged and can return quickly to the area from where it came. I appeal to Deputy Gildea. I always thought he was a decent man. All those who represented his constituency during my tenure in the House were decent, courageous people who were fearless in their representations on behalf of their constituents but they never had to do what Deputy Gildea did last Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Questions have been raised by various people regarding who helped the Deputy. Was it his own unaided effort or was he given help? If it was his own unaided effort, shame on him. If helpers concocted and cynically and sneeringly planned this statement, shame on them. It is easy in the aftermath to say an apology was made. I recall a time in the House when if a Member attempted to qualify an apology he or she was immediately ejected. That was the golden rule when I entered the House but that has changed over the years. However, that has been a dangerous change and it will come back to haunt the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the contributions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Seamus Brennan, both of whom attempted to encourage Deputy Gildea to withdraw his statement fully and unconditionally. They were unsuccessful and Deputy Gildea is now the villain of the piece. The good Members of the main Government party have come out without exception, apologised on his behalf and appealed to him. Let us hope the Deputy has the <Col N="454" /> courage of his convictions to make that apology. If he does not do so, there will be a time in the future when he will reflect on this occasion.</P>
    <P>For example, if a Member made a criminal allegation against Deputy Gildea, let it sit for 24 or 48 hours, then apologised for the hurt he caused him and withdrew the allegation would that be enough for him? Is something more not needed since the nature and seriousness of the allegations is such that the character of the person has been taken to the extent that an ordinary simple apology does not work? It is as if a man walked into a pub, hit another man and then said, &ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo;  I wonder how that would go down? It just does not work that way. Unfortunately, the Deputy is a relatively new Member of this House and I ask him to stand up and make the unconditional apology which has been the tradition in this House over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known Deputy Owen since 1981 when she was elected to Dáil Éireann. I have always found her to be a person of absolute integrity, commitment, dedication and with an interest in her job. She rose to the rank of Cabinet Minister in the last Government where she held the sensitive portfolio of Minister for Justice, a ministry which involved her in confidences of the State and the very essence of our democratic system and in matters of continuous and serious import to the lives of our citizens. Her integrity and good name have been bandied about for the last week. I have no doubt the people of Dublin North will make their judgment on her integrity in a resounding fashion next year.</P>
      <P>I have known Deputy Gildea since he came to this House. The public perception of the Deputy is of a quiet man, inoffensive, to whom this kind of character assassination remark appears to be grossly unnatural. I listened to his remarks on Radio na Gaeltachta and it is patently obvious he will not go beyond what he did, that is, he withdrew the section of the statement the Ceann Comhairle deemed to be offensive and he apologised.</P>
      <P>The right of privilege in this House under Article 15 of the Constitution is absolute. The chief executive officer of the company mentioned by Deputy Gildea now stands with his name indicted also. He has no mechanical way, legal or otherwise, of having his good name addressed in a court of law for himself, his family, his friends and his future. Therefore, it is not just about an apology being withdrawn and an apology being given to Members of the House, it is far more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan's last comment is relevant here. If an allegation of a serious sexual nature, criminal nature or a vicious allegation against any Member of this House is made by another, or against a person outside, not only will that be publicised and bandied about throughout the country, but that person must live with the consequences of a statement made in this House for the rest of his or her days. That is why this issue <Col N="455" /> must be put to a Vote this evening, so that the censure and right of privilege which is granted to Members elected by the people to this House is seen and understood to be a privilege and is used accordingly.</P>
    <P>The sad thing about this saga is that Deputy Owen became the cog in the wheel over the last week-end, diverting attention from the real issue being discussed here, that of a public inquiry into serious allegations in relation to the McBrearty affair in County Donegal. The person I blame for all of it is the person who sat opposite and accepted the same seal of office presented to Deputy Owen when she was appointed Minister for Justice. It may well be that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform in his smugness felt the remark attributed to Deputy Owen previously on another serious issue, that is, the Cahirciveen connection, was to his benefit by getting one back on Deputy Owen.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day in many ways for the kind of business that has been conducted here over the years. For over a quarter of a century, I have witnessed some of the most sensitive and personal allegations made in this House being withdrawn fully and completely and with no hard feelings afterwards. With every respect to Deputy Gildea, this appears to be a forced apology and one which is not real and wholesome. In the context of a forthcoming general election at the end of April next year, there may be other Deputies who might see an unnatural opportunity or advantage in this by making similarly wild statements about others. One could have an ever-increasing spiral of wild allegations and false statements to the detriment of the good name of democratic politics and those elected on trust to this House.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Gildea to go further than his remarks on Raidió na Gaeltachta and in this House and to take the opportunity afforded to him by every Member of this House, except Deputy Blaney who supported him, by standing up and addressing his remarks to Deputy Owen, and through her to the rest of the country. It is necessary for him to do so for the sake of his family and his supporters in Donegal who sent him here in the first instance to treat this House and the mechanics of national politics with respect and honour. He will go back to Donegal a better man for doing so.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, too, that this debate has been necessary. I am sorry Deputy Gildea did not take the opportunity of fully withdrawing the very serious and damaging allegations made against the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. I know the Deputy very well because both of us serve on the Committee of Public Accounts and we are involved in other activities around the House. I was astonished at the remarks because I consider them completely out of character for Deputy Gildea although I am not attributing them to his pen or anyone else's pen. Nonetheless, his remarks were very damag<Col N="456" /> ing. More importantly, as Deputy Kenny said, it diverted the debate and publicity from the subject of the motion last week on the inquiry into Garda activity in the McBrearty case in Donegal.</P>
      <P>This debate is not or should not be a &ldquo;bash Deputy Gildea&rdquo; debate. It is about the principle of parliamentary privilege and that privilege being upheld. This debate could also be about the conduct of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who sat idly by when the remarks were made. Perhaps he knew what he was doing. I am not saying it was part of an overall plan, but perhaps he sensed it would divert attention from the important debate which was taking place at the time. It is inexcusable for the Minister to have sat idly by without coming immediately to the defence of the previous holder of the office he now holds. If he intervened last week, perhaps we would not be having this debate because Deputy Gildea might have responded more positively to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gildea did not attempt to withdraw his remarks. Everyone is saying he withdrew his remarks immediately. The Dáil was adjourned on two occasions before he came in here and, at the insistence of the Government Chief Whip who was getting a bit panicky at that stage, the Deputy made a sort of withdrawal of his remarks. Some might say the Opposition is making big play of something which is not very important. I listened to the rambling contributions of the Minister, Deputies Fahey and Smith who said this was a matter of minor importance. It is not a matter of minor importance, it is a matter of serious concern. I or any other Deputy could get up here and accuse Minister X or Minister Y of behaving in a manner entirely unbecoming to their status as a person or Minister. I could come in here after the Dáil was adjourned twice and withdraw the remarks, but those remarks would be on the radio, television and newspapers the next day and a certain number of people would believe the outrageous remarks I had made. When one includes remarks on the record of the House, they remain on the record forever, therefore, it was a very serious matter. Deputy Gildea still has that opportunity. The Independent Deputies, in a show of loyalty to Deputy Gildea, said that he withdrew his remarks. The Fine Gael Party and the entire Opposition, with the exception of one, took this matter so seriously they stayed out of the Dáil. The Minister for Defence made light of that but that is how seriously the matter was taken. It is serious for continued goodwill in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Let us withdraw parliamentary privilege altogether. If it did not exist then Deputy Gildea, I and other Deputies would be a lot more careful about what we say in here because we would have to stand over it outside the House.</P>

      <P>I too support the motion. I am impressed by the number of people who have spoken here, and in private, about the esteem in which Deputy Owen is held by all sides of the <Col N="457" /> House. I have been impressed by many of the statements from the Government benches and their views on the damage done to Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>It is a privilege to be in this Parliament. For centuries we fought to have a parliament and it is a privilege that this generation can represent the people in an independent Irish Parliament. Privilege is at the heart of our democracy. That we have the freedom to raise issues without threat of any kind is important and central to our democratic system. That privilege brings with it responsibility and we have obligations because of it. We have obligations to ourselves, our parties and the Parliament and we must be as accurate and honest as possible in the statements we make. Deputy Gildea's statement was calculated. Many other statements referred to were made off the cuff and in the course of political debate &ndash; and were totally out of order because of that. A calculated, clear, detailed and unambiguous retraction should be made.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Gildea quite well and have great respect for him. What hit us hardest at first was that what he said was so out of character. I do not understand why this happened. Maybe Deputy Gildea, a very decent Member of this House, will explain to us why this took place. Deputy Owen should not have been put in a position where her integrity was questioned or where the media reported what happened. It is rightly the duty of the media to do that. Her integrity should not be questioned in that way because, as everybody agrees, her integrity is without question. She should not be forced to defend her good name in public and in private or have to explain the position she finds herself in. Neither should her family have been put in such a position. I had a discussion earlier today with a member of the Government who had experience of their family being put in such a position.</P>
      <P>I recognise the contribution that Deputy Owen's family have made and the special position it enjoys in this party. Like every other party, there are families in a special position. Her grand-uncle was one of the founding fathers and maybe the hurt runs a bit deeper because of that.</P>

      <P>The debate here last week sought an inquiry into the conduct of a number of gardaí in Donegal. A cloud has been hanging over the Garda Síochána in Donegal for the past four years, a family felt they had been seriously wronged. A public inquiry was sought to investigate the matter. Last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke about having an inquiry. One of his points was that it would not have been possible to have such a debate as there could be civil, legal or criminal proceedings taking place. In that event, and if that is the reason he is giving for refusing such a debate, there would be no one at Dublin Castle for the Flood Tribunal and no tribunal of inquiry into the infection of persons with haemophilia. Pro<Col N="458" /> ceedings were issued before that; the Minister can check that out.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, spoke about the Director of Public Prosecutions and his function on whether to charge people. The people involved are still members of An Garda Síochána and a cloud still hangs over them. Many of those gardaí will be preparing files and sending them to the DPP for his adjudication. The object of the debate last week was to try to clear things up in Donegal and it was disappointing that the two Donegal Deputies did not support the motion. Not alone did they let down the people of Donegal and the country as a whole, they let down the Garda. A number of gardaí I meet are anxious to have such an inquiry.</P>
      <P>We all come into this world in the same way. We come in with a good name and while we are in this world it is up to us to either improve or damage that name. The Minister admitted to Deputy Owen's honesty last night, although he had failed to protect her when she was attacked. In 40 years time, a grandchild of Deputy Owen may research the family and find these charges in the pages of the <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Times</i> and the record of the House. While Deputy Gildea has withdrawn his comments and apologised for the hurt to Deputy Owen and Fine Gael, he did not say that what he said was untrue. He did not say there was no substance to what he said nor did he say he was wrong. Why did he make those statements? I worry about why he made those statements. He should give an explanation why he made them.</P>

      <P>It gives me no pleasure to speak on this motion. I do not like to see any Member under attack. I have known Deputy Gildea since I came into politics and I like him as a person. The attack he made on my colleague, Deputy Owen, last week was probably the most outrageous attack anybody has made on an individual since I came into this House. I ask Deputy Gildea to withdraw the remark immediately and to say there was no substance to what he said. I sat beside Deputy Owen last week and she was devastated by his remarks. She was devastated outside the House and in the Members' Bar. I do not know who asked Deputy Gildea to make those remarks. He should do the honourable thing tonight and tell the Irish people who put him up to it. If he said it himself he should apologise. He should be big enough to say: &ldquo;I'm sorry. I did something that was wrong and I want to say to Deputy Owen, her friends and family that I made a very serious mistake.&rdquo; He should withdraw all the remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone said, when one comes into this world as a baby, one has nothing but one's good name.  One brings that through life and tries to <Col N="459" /> pass it on to one's children. One tries to protect one's family, which is difficult enough to do in politics. It is hard to keep one's family out of public life.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Gildea's remarks and I watched the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and Deputy Gildea went down in my estimation. As Minister, with 75 spin doctors and £130 million spent on consultants, he went through every file in his Department for the last four and a half years and he knows, as all the Government knows, that if any wrong had been done it would not be Deputy Gildea spreading muck. It would have been done by Fianna Fáil because they are past masters at it.</P>
    <P>I ask that these remarks be withdrawn because what happened last week was that Deputy Gildea was embarrassed. There were constituents of his present whom he had promised to support if a motion came to the Dáil proposing a public inquiry. He was embarrassed and he looked for a way out. He and Deputy Blaney told people in Donegal: &ldquo;When we go to Dáil Éireann as your representatives we will back you.&rdquo; They got the opportunity last week to do so and the best Deputy Gildea could do was to destroy the name of Deputy Owen. Her grand-uncle was the great Michael Collins and we saw in the past how people tried to destroy his good name, though he helped to set up the State.</P>
    <P>I was elected to the Dáil in June 1994 and it is the greatest honour that can be bestowed on anyone. There are 166 people elected to receive that great honour. The privilege of the Dáil should not be abused by anybody, Independents, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, and nobody's good name should be taken away. I listened to the Independents tonight and I nearly took out my handkerchief and cried for them. These are the same Independents who are telling the nation they are the ones propping up the Government but they do not like criticism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gildea is a man I always respected. If he does not withdraw these remarks tonight he is doing himself, his family, his constituency and the Dáil a dishonour. Withdraw the remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my privilege to propose Deputy Owen to the House for appointment as Minister for Justice and to introduce her to the President to receive her seal of office. Deputy Owen's term of office will be recalled as one where she showed tremendous courage and integrity under extreme pressure. She was an efficient Minister for Justice who acted speedily when issues needed to be dealt with but above all else she was and is a compassionate human being. No other member of the Government or my party, when I was privileged to lead it, came more frequently to tell me of a colleague who might be in difficulty or pain of some kind. She would urge me to do whatever I could to offer them consolation or encouragement in their difficulty. <Col N="460" /> Deputy Owen is someone who feels for other people and who understands the hurt that others feel. Because she is that type of person she is therefore much more hurt than most others would be by the sort of comment made by Deputy Gildea.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gildea is not a fool. He has been here for the last four and a half years and he has observed public life in Ireland for a long time. He knew exactly how hurtful his remarks would be to Deputy Owen. Those remarks were prepared. His was not an off the cuff remark made in the course of a heated debate. He came in with his remarks written out, deliberately prepared and ready to be delivered. Deputy Gildea knew well that if he said those things outside the House he would be sued. Deputy Fox has referred to the fact that I met Deputy Gildea after the last election, as I met her and Deputy Healy-Rae. Deputy Gildea made no suggestions to me about the integrity of Deputy Owen when he met me privately. He did not do so because there is no foundation to such remarks and if he had, even in the privacy of our discussions, it would have been slander and he would have been liable to be sued. No, Deputy Gildea waited and waited until, on an entirely extraneous debate that had nothing to do with his remarks, he could say those false things knowing he could not be sued and that he personally could not suffer.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Gildea has studied history. He will know there are Deputies who have made such slanderous remarks under privilege against other Members without suffering politically, even though they deserved to. Unfortunately the Irish people are not as discerning as they ought to be and they do not recognise the deep cowardice involved in making the sort of statement Deputy Gildea made under privilege. People will just think: &ldquo;isn't he a great man, he could speak up. He could say what people were thinking but were afraid to say,&rdquo; even though that was completely untrue. They will admire him for it. He only needs a quota, not 100% of the vote. In a cool, calculating way, Deputy Gildea has worked out that some people at least in Donegal will think that way and say: &ldquo;Good man, Tom.&rdquo; I say: &ldquo;Bad man, Tom.&rdquo; Deputy Gildea is a disgrace to this House and his unwillingness to show any real feeling or to speak from his heart in his apology does him no credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspect of political life which causes me the most distress is the ability of politicians from all sides to engage in personal vilification. We have had plenty of examples of it in the House since I became a Member and many of us have suffered from it. The kind of personal vilification that passes for political debate at times in the House is worse than being mugged in the street by a stranger because it is like being assaulted by a neighbour or a colleague. It is all the more distasteful if an attack is made within Leinster House on a Mem<Col N="461" /> ber. All of us believe in our profession and this House is the centrepiece of our democracy and we all have a duty to act in a responsible manner at all times, not just when it suits us. We should be responsible towards each other and those outside the House. If we are not we devalue our role as representatives and leaders of our people.</P>
      <P>I put my sympathy, if that is the correct word, with Deputy Owen on the record. I do not believe anybody in this House should endure the experience she suffered. There is no place in decent politics for unsubstantiated allegations against Members, whatever their political hue.</P>
      <P>This matter transcends party politics. It cuts to the root of the malaise of cynicism from which the Irish political process currently suffers and I do not make excuses for the fact that Deputies often contribute to the cynicism. All Members have heard those outside the House saying politicians are only in it for themselves, for what they can get out of it. The motives of good men and women have often been questioned. We know that the vast majority of politicians do their best to act honourably and honestly, even if they do not get everything right. When an incident such as the one under discussion happens, it makes it difficult for voters to respect those involved in political life. How can people be expected to vote in elections if they do not respect politicians? Who will go forward as a candidate in an election in the belief that they are liable to suffer a character assassination?</P>
      <P>I have to say that episodes such as that which occurred on 21 November serve to undermine the flagging confidence in the body politic. There can be no excuse for Deputy Gildea's behaviour and his actions were not supported by those on the Government benches. Those who engage in similar behaviour in the future will similarly find no succour on this side of the House. Having said that, Deputy Gildea withdrew the allegations he made during Private Members' time last week, albeit only having been formally requested by the Ceann Comhairle to do so. He apologised on 22 November to the House, to Deputy Owen, her family and her party and thereby complied with the practices and procedures of the House, which is why I support the Government amendment asking the Dáil to accept Deputy Gildea's withdrawal and apology and to accept the custom and practice of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some misdirected criticism was levelled at my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was in the House at the time. I found myself in a similar situation some years back when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was the victim of a savage and personal attack from Opposition Members, although I have to say they were not Members of the Fine Gael Party. I had to sit on my hands as I expected the Chair to defend the integrity of Members. This sorry episode has tarnished the reputation of the House, just as it tarnished Deputy Owen's good character and reputation. I hope a lesson can be learned from the week gone by, that this <Col N="462" /> House should have the highest possible standards. It is a lesson we should not have to learn. If we do not show respect to one another, we cannot expect those outside the House to respect us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gildea's behaviour was the worst form of cowardice I have ever witnessed. I have had the pleasure of being both Government or Opposition Whip on four occasions. I have never encountered any Member, from any side of the House, acting in such a cowardly and disgraceful manner as I witnessed last Wednesday. I was shocked to read the rubbish spoken by Deputy Gildea, who accused a colleague of receiving bribes, and indeed accused another person of offering bribes.</P>
      <P>What has Deputy Gildea been doing for the last four and a half years? He is a public representative and a legislator. If he had information suggesting that a Member of this House received bribes or if he was aware that somebody was bribing a Deputy, why did he not contact the Garda Síochána to have the matter investigated? He did not report the matter to the Garda as he knew it was completely and utterly untrue. If he knew the Garda in County Donegal had acted in an improper fashion, he should have reported it to the Garda Commissioner. He did not do so because he knew it was not the case.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter for division along Government and Opposition lines. I say to Members on all sides of the House that it is time we stood up for ourselves. It is time we declared that certain things are acceptable and certain things are unacceptable. Whips should not be imposed in this instance as it is a simple motion which one either supports or does not. For the Government to put down an amendment to a simple motion of censure is nothing short of ridiculous. Deputy Gildea's comments were not a slip of the tongue. His script was written by somebody. I admire Deputy Rabbitte for challenging Deputy Gildea and for defending the good name of Deputy Owen, but Deputy Gildea continued to speak until the bitter end. He made certain that he delivered all his rubbish so that it went on the record of the House. He did not stop.</P>

This is a bad example to set for prospective Members. The new recruits who come into the House following the next election will realise that all they need to do to get publicity is make a wild statement about somebody which will receive banner headlines and withdraw it the following day because there are no sanctions.

      <P>Let the record show that time was offered. There are a number of questions everyone wishes to put to Deputy Gildea. Why did he say what he said? Why did he write down what he said in advance? Why did he not completely withdraw the statement when he was finally forced to withdraw it? Why will he not now state that there was no substance to the allegations? Let us be very clear about Deputy Gildea's charge against Deputy Owen although its restatement may be hurtful. A former Government Member was charged with illegally directing approximately 100 members of the Garda Síochána to undertake a course of action on behalf of a commercial company in which she had a beneficial financial interest. That is a devastating charge. Yet Deputy Gildea sits silently behind me although he still has an opportunity to explain his reasons for making such an allegation or to state it is completely without substance. Deputy Gildea's apology, no matter how sincere, will not make amends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gildea's first comment when the Ceann Comhairle finally came into the House last week was &ldquo;can I continue with my speech?&rdquo;. Deputy Shatter will confirm this. This, following objections from Deputy Rabbitte and others through which Deputy Gildea ploughed on. I was so shocked that I did not have a chance to rise in defence of my former Cabinet colleague. What<Col N="465" /> ever happens, Deputy Gildea's comments will remain on the record. He has not substantively withdrawn his statement, nor has he stated that the charge was completely without substance. No motive or explanation was outlined as to why Deputy Gildea made this premeditated statement.</P>
    <P>Was this some kind of attempt on Deputy Gildea's part to detract attention from the Visitors Gallery in which people who had worked for him in his constituency prior to the previous election sat? Deputy Gildea embarked on a suicide mission to detract attention from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who refused to provide for a public sworn inquiry into the outrageous abuses allegedly undertaken by gardaí in Donegal which have been the subject of civil legal proceedings. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the short-term winner of Deputy Gildea's self-destructive action and people just outside this Chamber are hovering like vultures to take the Deputy's seat at the next election.</P>
    <P>The Minister, an experienced politician, must stand partly indicted for what happened in this House last week. The longest serving Minister for Justice in modern times sat in the front bench knowing that the first part of Deputy Gildea's allegations in regard to the Garda Commissioner would have been impossible to achieve. The Minister sat there and failed to defend two things&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will turn to the righteous morality of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in a few moments. The person who has the honour of being part of the Cabinet and who is endorsed by this House could at least have indicated that this part of Deputy Gildea's charge was untrue. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform chose to say nothing. His reaction yesterday in this Chamber and his repeated assertion of lies &ndash; his words, not mine, which were still are on the blacks this morning &ndash; is an indication of how he felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn to the defence of the Fianna Fáil Party, articulated with heartfelt feeling earlier this evening by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. There is a certain degree of hypocrisy in the action taken by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats. We <Col N="466" /> understood that the Government Chief Whip, whose skill with the Independents is beyond doubt, worked over the weekend to encourage Deputy Gildea to come into the House and make a statement although his efforts clearly failed. The Fianna Fáil Party did not have to table an amendment to this motion; it did not have to do anything. However, Fianna Fáil is so dependent on Deputy Gildea's vote until it takes him out at the next general election that it is not even prepared to allow the House to censure him for something in which it had no part. If the Government could not bring itself to go all the way and censure Deputy Gildea for his obvious abuse of privilege, it did not have to do anything. Yet, it is so dependent on Deputy Gildea's vote, until next May or June at the outset, that it could not run the risk of him failing to vote with it on the next critical vote. Deputy Power, clearly against his better judgment, will come into the House to vote for something in which he does not believe, as will other Government Deputies who have both privately and publicly intimated their abhorrence &ndash; a word used by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in his contribution &ndash; in this matter. The Government is refusing to censure a Deputy for a gross abuse of parliamentary privilege.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's pre-election campaign slogan was &ldquo;people before politics&rdquo;. If ever we needed a succinct exposition or demonstration of the degree to which politics is put before any aspect of people's lives, we can see it in the Government's dependency on the vote of someone who has clearly abused the privileges of this House and cast a slur on the character of another Member. In the next couple of minutes the actions of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will prove that politics comes before people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the senior Government Minister in the House, to consider not pressing the amendment even at this late stage. The Fianna Fáil Party does not have to vote at all. It can simply abstain and allow the record to demonstrate that a sufficient number of Deputies voted in favour of a motion of censure on a Deputy who has refused to speak and explain why he made premeditated allegations in this House which are without substance and the content of which is completely libellous. Deputy Gildea has refused to avail of the time offered to him to fully withdraw those allegations. If, as expected, the expedient of politics over people carries the day, the position of every Deputy in this House, irrespective of his or her political allegiance, will be damaged in a manner which will be very difficult to repair in the future.</P>

      <P>There are very few parishes that have not been touched by road deaths and, in many cases, the death of young people has been involved. If this Bill saves lives on our roads, it will be very important. It is geared towards changing the behaviour of road users, improving the safety aspects of vehicles, correcting certain deficiencies in relation to road traffic signage and providing basic infrastructure. It is important that all aspects of safety infrastructure are addressed.</P>
      <P>The principal feature of the Bill is the concept of penalty points which has major implications for all road users. I welcome the extended use of speed cameras and the new provisions in relation to breath testing to combat the problem of drink driving. The fact that 33% of road fatalities are drink related is a convincing argument for a very strong clamp down on drink driving. The Bill, in introducing the penalty points system, promotes the same focus as has been used in other countries. As a Deputy for County Donegal, I would ask the Minister to elaborate on how the penalty points system will be co-ordinated with the system already in operation in the six counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am aware that if one is disqualified on one side of the Border, the disqualification will be recognised on both sides. However, can the penalty points be acquired in either jurisdiction?</P>
      <P>The charge will be increased by 50% if payment of the original amount is not made within 28 days. That is only right and fair. If people have committed the crime, they should pay promptly for it. A commitment was given in the road safety strategy that there will be a review of the present legal requirement for a member of the Garda Síochána to form the opinion that a person has consumed alcohol before a breathalyser is used. I am glad the Bill widens the Garda powers in that regard. A fixed charge is not provided for in relation to careless driving, using a vehicle without insurance and dangerously driving a defective vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the issue of driving without insurance it would be remiss not to mention the problem of insurance for young drivers. Of course nobody should drive without insurance. However, last week I heard the case of a young man in my constituency. He is an apprentice and earns about £150 per week. He lives in a rural part of the con<Col N="473" /> stituency and he must have transport to get to his job. There is no public transport in the area so he had to buy a car. He bought a cheap car and was charged £1,200 for his first insurance policy. Unfortunately, he had an accident in the first year and when the insurance came up for renewal he was charged £4,300. The car was worth about £500.</P>
    <P>If a person is earning £150 per week and is faced with an insurance bill of £4,300 for the year, one wonders if they will choose the right or wrong thing to do. One can see that the two situations are difficult to reconcile. I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and other Ministers are examining the issue of car insurance. There must be imagination and continued effort to resolve the issue of car insurance for young people. I deliberately used the example of somebody who had had an accident because we mainly hear about the people who never have an accident.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not deal with the faultless driver and what carrot they should get. It deals with penalty points. Sometimes it would be nice to have a balance between both. I could talk for 20 minutes solely on the issue of car insurance for young people. It should be kept to the fore when discussing a Bill dealing with road safety. When it is impossible for young people to get any other method of transport and there is no public transport, they need a car. That does not excuse them driving without insurance but the insurance bill I mentioned was £4,300 &ndash; I am sure there are other cases of higher and lower amounts &ndash; and the person will be in that situation for five years. It will be five years before anybody else will even give them a quote. It is a serious issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the protection of the environment. There is no NCT testing centre in Inishowen. I was given the impression from the criteria for such centres that Inishowen would have been entitled to one given the fact that most of the population live more than 30 miles from the nearest test centre. This is causing difficulty and could even be called discrimination against part of my constituency. While I am told there is much discussion between councillors, the NCT agency and so forth, we still do not have a testing centre and that is causing problems for my constituents. I hope the Minister of State will be able to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have huge implications for all road users given that they could be put off the road after accumulating 12 points. It must be directed at those who cause real risk on the road. Some people are drinking and driving and that must be eradicated. Some people drive at wildly excessive speeds which also must be stopped. One hears people boasting that they drive at speeds of up to 140 miles per hour. That should not happen.</P>
    <P>We are updating the 1961 legislation. Perhaps <Col N="474" /> on Committee Stage the Minister will address the issue of people driving under the influence of drugs. The gardaí can stop motorists and test them for drink. Is there a way that they can also stop motorists and randomly test them for drugs? What are the difficulties and issues involved? I am anxious to know more about that. Given the changes that have occurred since 1961, the increasing speed of our lifestyles and the long distances involved in commuting to work, it is not easy to describe the reality for the road user.</P>
    <P>I drive a colossal number of miles so I see at first hand most of the problems one will encounter in all geographical locations. I have driven through practically all of Ireland. I would like to be a law abiding person when I drive the car. I do my best, although I do not always succeed, to give good example on the road. We have discussed the motorist's responsibilities on the road and one of them is to give good example and to drive safely.</P>
    <P>We are talking tonight about responsibility, giving people penalty points and penalising drivers who break the law. However, the debate must go further because there are associated complex and simple issues of rights as well as responsibilities. There is a right to have roads that are safe for driving and free from potholes or frost. There should be a right to have roads that are wide enough for the pedestrians and motorists who use them. We have a right to have roads that are adequately marked for junctions, turns and lay-bys and which make the road safe for other motorists to access and leave it without endangering others.</P>
    <P>There is a right to have main roads that are appropriate for driving at a reasonable speed, which should encompass the right to drive at speeds up to the national speed limit. As a motorist, I am most concerned about this issue. We are seeking to deal with people who break the law and drive dangerously and at excessive speeds but the vast majority of people are not in that category. That majority should have the rights I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Pedestrians want the right to walk safely and motorists want the right to expect other road users to be visible. This relates to the use of reflective bands by pedestrians. We tend to go through phases of promoting the use of such bands but it cannot be promoted enough. I drive many country roads and have encountered all sorts of situations. Bicycles and cars should be properly lit. Motorists should not be permitted to use mobile phones when driving. Whatever about using a hands free unit, it is incredible to see motorists holding a mobile to their ear and trying to drive, change gears and turn corners at the same time.</P>
    <P>It is important that people adhere to the rules of the road and use basic courtesy on the road, thus enabling other motorists to travel safely to <Col N="475" /> their destinations. However, some of our main roads are extremely narrow. My attention was recently drawn to the stretch of road which links my home town with Derry and Letterkenny. The road was resurfaced and what drew my attention was the continuous white lines which seemed to extend the length of the journey I was making. Under current legislation it is an offence to overtake on such lines. It will also be an offence under this Bill and will result in penalty points. It is only right that there be safety rules where the road is too narrow. However, should the motorist not have a degree of fair play?</P>
    <P>The road I am referring to is a recognised scenic route as well as the main road between two urban centres. Should this road serve as a tourist route with the implications that has for speed on the road? Often one is trapped in a queue of traffic because somebody is travelling at 30 miles per hour and cannot be overtaken. Should it be a road that lorries and cars from our northerly location use commercially for regular transit? These lorries serve the fishing industry and are travelling hundreds of miles while I, too, travel hundreds of miles. Can it be both? Have we the right to travel slowly and take in a view while simultaneously offering other road users the right to get from A to B at a reasonable speed and in reasonable time? How much thought goes into road design and the adequacy of the policies of the local authorities or nationally pertaining to the inclusion within road design of lay-bys at regular intervals. I have raised this at county council level this week by way of a motion which was very positively responded to. We do not have national primary or secondary roads so we rely on the county roads as our main access. I would like to hear the Minister's response to the concept of a minimum speed limit on some roads as is the case in other countries. I wonder how this would work in practice given the farming nature of much of our country. I look at the wide sections of road on the N2 from Carrickmacross to Castleblayney. It is a two lane road and invariably when one travels on this stretch of road one will encounter the person driving at 30 or 40 miles per hour in the centre of the road. The tailback grows behind him.</P>
    <P>Surely the simple solution here would be to put an extra lane for overtaking which would leave room for pedestrians and a hard shoulder. Practical solutions to real problems will alleviate the situation for people who must travel long distances and do not want to travel at 80 miles per hour. The vast majority of drivers prefer to just get from A to B within the speed limit and in a reasonable time. Often the car that has delayed a queue of traffic for miles will stay in the outer lane even when there is a climbing lane provided ensuring that those who have waited patiently for a location to overtake are further frustrated in <Col N="476" /> their goal of achieving their destination in a reasonable amount of time. This leads to dangerous mistakes and risks being taken out of frustration. The Minister may say people should allow more time for their journey but I am outlining the reality. The reasonable expectation of a journey time is being expanded on a daily basis. The 170 miles from Dublin to Moville in any other European country would take a maximum of three hours. In Ireland it takes four to five and a half hours. I wonder if that is a reasonable expectation of a journey time.</P>
    <P>The N2-A5 road is a classic example of where a driver could be in trouble in relation to all 12 points if he wished to complete the journey in less than five and a half hours. This road has not yet been given motorway status under the national development plan. It has a huge volume of traffic and has all the problems that I have outlined &ndash; miles and miles of narrow roads with practically no option for overtaking or pulling in. Surely the people of the north-west are entitled to the same right as the people who travel to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Belfast? Surely we should be entitled to a road that can safely allow motorists travel and drive up to the national speed limit and not drive at an average of 37 miles per hour for stretches of perhaps 30 miles at a time? I am reiterating my long-standing request to the Cabinet to work with the Northern Executive to present us with a proper safe road that will keep us out of the clutches of the 12 points.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people do not wish to drive recklessly and fast. There is a small percentage of people who need to be stopped but we also need the right to a road that is capable of taking the type of transport about which I am talking.</P>
    <P>The new written test will improve knowledge of the rules of the road. Some older drivers are set in their ways and we must remind people about the issue of courtesy on the roads and the rules of the road. I was in Spain last year and I saw a little playground where children could bring their small bicycles or skateboards. It contained roundabouts, traffic lights and all the different items that one would meet on the roads. What a child would not have learned about the rules of the road in that small playground would not have been worth knowing. We should consider developing such playgrounds here. A primary school child could be taught about yield and stop signs and the proper way to negotiate a roundabout.</P>
    <P>We should look at the carrot as well as the stick approach. Drivers who respect the rules of the road should be rewarded. All motorists who achieve a number of consecutive years of accident free driving should be given some sort of motor tax credit for a given time such as a year.</P>
    <P>It is a serious offence to drive without insurance but at the moment it is so expensive <Col N="477" /> that it is creating a difficulty of its own which needs to be addressed. We need to be sure that when we drive around a corner we will not meet someone who is full of alcohol. I commend the ideals behind this Bill. I hope to hold on to as many points as I can for as long as possible.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill. The year 1998 saw the publication of the &ldquo;Road to Safety&rdquo;, the first time such a strategy had been produced here and I acknowledge that. That was three years ago. I remember the time well because it followed a period of a high number of deaths on the roads. Many of the incidents were particularly horrifying. After a spate of dreadful road accidents that culminated in the deaths of two children and three adults in a head-on collision in County Wicklow, there was a huge public outcry and we were spurred into action. We were assured that the road safety strategy which had been announced two months previously would be implemented in all its elements as quickly as possible. Today three years later we are now just discussing the legislation which will introduce the most valuable element of that strategy &ndash; the implementation of the proposed penalty points system.</P>
      <P>The delay in this implementation is inexcusable. It is obvious to all of us that we will not see the introduction of the penalty points system by this time next year. The necessary infrastructure for its implementation will not be in place. The difficulties in setting up a register of drivers could take many years to sort out. There are Constitutional and legal complexities involved in establishing this register. The law in force at present means that the Garda cannot use a person's PRSI number to identify him or her for prosecution purposes or to establish a database. The establishment of the database of drivers and the introduction of the technology to allow the automatic issuing of fines and endorsements will take years to establish. After three years of delay and with the legislation before the House now we need to solve the problem of fatal road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 or 1998 I was one of those calling for an immediate introduction of the penalty points system. We had an annual total of road deaths of 470 people and that had been increasing since 1993. It was quite frightening when we compared our statistics with other EU countries. The UK has a far lower accident rate. We were comparable to places like Spain and Portugal. I know that the figures have decreased slightly this year, but not enough. This month we have again seen a number of horrific accidents. Each weekend brings its own tragic story. It appears that we will reach a figure of 400 road deaths this year. It is a tragic story, one of which none of us can be proud and we should not forget all those who are injured or permanently maimed in accidents. <Col N="478" /> They exist and the heartache that is visited on them and their families is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I was struck by a statement made by the Chairman of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, when launching the organisation's annual report last year. He said that 1,000 of the 62,000 young people who sat the leaving certificate will have been killed in road crashes by the year 2008, and 4,000 more will have suffered serious injuries. He has been critical of the Government's inaction in the delay in implementing the road strategy.</P>
    <P>If this programme had been implemented we would have saved up to 200 lives and prevented many more injuries over the period of delay. Is this due to a lack of financial resources or has a lack of political will slowed up the introduction of the strategy?</P>
    <P>I believe a penalty points system works very well as seen in the case of Northern Ireland. I lived in the UK for a number of years and I have personal experience of the system there. After one or two speeding offences, one becomes acutely aware of the consequences of additional points. A total of 12 points results in an automatic endorsement on one's licence. It is a deterrent that should prove to be very effective. Fines are too easy to pay &ndash; even an on the spot fine of £50 &ndash; and one quickly forgets the incident. The consequences of an endorsement are much more serious. Being without a licence can have consequences for employment and other areas &ndash; most people are now very reliant on their cars as a means of transport &ndash; and it will also have an effect on insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that the system is put in place if we are to reduce speed and save lives. Speed is one of the major killers on the roads today. It is incongruous that we see an array of car advertisements emphasising performance and a car's ability to get from nought to 60 in so many seconds. What is the point of all this when we have speed limits? Being a woman I do not see the attraction of speed or powerful cars. I use my car to get from A to B at a reasonable speed and I fail to see the value of something which one cannot legitimately find an opportunity to use. That is the market and the world we live in and we have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations relating to a range of road traffic matters which includes the maximum speed limits. I wait with interest to see how that can be implemented. As we import all of our vehicles I am not sure how this can be implemented but it must be possible.</P>
    <P>Speed is the biggest factor in road accidents and road deaths. It is estimated that over 40% of fatal accidents are caused by excessive or inappropriate speed. Speed reduces control of the car and the driver cannot negotiate bends in the road with the same degree of care that can be achieved at a lower speed. It takes longer to stop a car <Col N="479" /> going at excessive speed and the faster the car moves the less time the driver has to react. Many situations are beyond the control of the driver, such as obstructions, pedestrians and the reckless behaviour of other drivers.</P>
    <P>A car travelling at 60 miles per hour on a wet road will take 140 yards to come to a halt and this obviously increases with higher speeds. We are all aware of it but need to be reminded that the faster one goes the harder it is to stop and the less control one has over a car. The higher the speed the greater the consequences should there be an accident. A pedestrian hit by a car travelling at 35 miles per hour is more likely to be killed than if they were hit by a car travelling at 30 miles per hour. A small increment in speed can result in the death of a pedestrian.</P>
    <P>Many young men die on our roads and it is a sad fact that the majority of road deaths are of young men. The profile of a driver most likely to be killed or injured on the roads is a male in the age group 17-25 who has been a licence holder for less than two years. Young men in this category are involved in over half of all road accidents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the driving theory test. It is a good measure. My colleague, Deputy Naughten, put together an excellent document in which he proposed to facilitate young drivers with insurance. High insurance premiums discriminate against young people. I questioned the Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently on the forthcoming report on the insurance industry which is examining the high rates of premia for young drivers. We are told this is due to their high accident rate, and I do not doubt that, but we need more transparency on those figures to try to ascertain if that group is bearing an unfair burden. Car ownership has become almost essential today and it is very hard to get around without a car in the absence of adequate public transport. It is therefore essential for young people to have a car, particularly when they get a job.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme and other youth groups have produced very valuable proposals in this area to facilitate discussion with the insurance companies to bring down the currently high rates of insurance premia. Some insurance companies have moved in this area and are focusing on driving tests to ensure that young drivers who have a higher degree of competency will accordingly have their insurance reduced.</P>
    <P>There are 400,000 provisional licence holders and there is no prohibition on those who have not passed their tests from returning to the road. Provisional licence holders drive unaccompanied all the time. They have to wait so long to be called for a test that they ignore the law. Everybody turns a blind eye. We know this is happening but the law is not being observed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Seat belts are extremely important and we have a lax attitude towards them. Three out of four people will be killed or seriously injured in a 30 miles per hour head on crash if they do not wear their seat belts. Seat belts save lives and everybody is legally obliged to wear one, including back seat passengers. I compliment the National Safety Council which is currently running an effective television advertisement road safety campaign. The advertisements send shivers through one's spine as they graphically portray car accidents and the injuries caused to those who do not wear seat belts. We should all take stock of these advertisements, especially given that wearing of rear seat belts is not observed in Ireland. Very young people should be restrained. Today I saw a baby on the lap of an adult in the front of a car. It was frightening because a minor impact could have sent the baby through the windscreen. Vigilance in regard to the wearing of seat belts is essential.</P>
    <P>School bus safety is also important. Throughout the country school children travel on old buses three to a seat to swimming classes, football matches and on their school tours. This is highly dangerous because they are unrestrained. This issue has been debated previously and we have been told this is down to economics. If only one life is saved, that argument does not stand up. A new fleet of buses should be provided. There are difficulties in doing this but the issue can be addressed.</P>
    <P>Cycling is a wonderful mode of travel, but many cyclists do not wear helmets and are not aware of the rules of the road. In built-up areas in particular, one encounters cyclists who do not understand signals or the layout of junctions, yet they are let loose on our roads without having undertaken a test in the basic skills of cycling. I feel strongly about this and we should ensure that cyclists know the rules of the road and how a car operates so that they are aware of blind spots for drivers. We all know how things can go horribly wrong if someone is not aware of a driver blind spot for instance.</P>
    <P>As to the effects of alcohol and drugs on ability to drive, I am not sure about the details of drug testing but it is important that it should be introduced. It must be recognised that a person's senses are dulled by drugs and he or she is not in full control of his or her body as a result.</P>
    <P>I live in an urban area and, like other local authority members, receive constant requests from householders and residents' associations for the introduction of traffic calming measures on roads that have become rat runs for traffic. Can reduced speed limits be applied to such areas to make drivers slow down and realise they are entering built up areas where young children and pedestrians are on the streets? Such a policy has been adopted in the UK and the police were willing to accept it provided ramps were used. It <Col N="481" /> would be worthwhile. Many of the queries I receive from my constituents relate to traffic calming and the local authority does not have the resources to implement such measures everywhere. Reduced speed limits in built up areas should be considered. They are applied in industrial estates and I do not see why they cannot be introduced in areas where local authorities believe they would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to contribute. Road safety is a major concern for all of us. I am particularly conscious that so many young men lose their lives unnecessarily. We should all remember, as we debate this legislation, the young people who have been horribly injured in accidents and who must carry that burden for the rest of their lives. I welcome the introduction of a penalty points system at long last, which will help to reduce speed on our roads.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution on this legislation, which is very necessary. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on bringing it forward. He outlined in his opening contribution that the Bill enhances the code of law that was originally promulgated in 1961. There have been major changes in Ireland since and our distinguished Ceann Comhairle is the only Member who served in the House at that time. The structure of our society and our roads infrastructure have changed dramatically. The number of vehicles parked in housing estates in both urban and rural areas is a major problem as many households run three or four cars.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is confident an agreement will be reached between the Irish Farmers Association and the National Roads Authority in regard to progressing the national development plan and, in particular, the development of the national primary road network. I hope the necessary preparatory work in design and planning will commence as quickly as possible and farmers will provide access to farm land to officials to carry out this necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three categories of driver in Northern Ireland &ndash; learner, registered and fully licensed. The registered category should be introduced in the Republic. I have travelled extensively in the North and registered drivers take more care and pay more attention to their driving. An individual requires registered status following a driving test, having spent time as a learner driver. This predominantly concerns young people and it is necessary for them to gain experience and to adopt good habits in terms of <Col N="482" /> good practice on roads. Many drivers in the registered category in the North, unfortunately, do not maintain due care and attention when they travel on roads south of the Border. I hope the Minister will consider introducing a new category of registered driver.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney quite rightly alluded to the exorbitant cost of motor insurance. It is time decisions were made to substantially reduce the significant burden of insurance, particularly on young people. The legal and medical aspects of insurance awards should be addressed and those costs should be reduced substantially.</P>
    <P>A number of people have raised the question of a reserve Garda force with me. People may say there are sufficient civil and public servants but those who spoke to me had in mind the opportunity that exists to employ retired Garda personnel or retired Permanent Defence Forces personnel to police traffic. All of us know the frustrations that arise from delays when travelling on the main national roadways and the minor routes. Traffic could be policed not necessarily by the Garda Síochána but by a reserve Garda force, particularly in view of the need to control traffic through built-up areas and urban centres. Deputies Keaveney and Clune spoke about the need to be able to assess drivers whom a garda believes is under the influence of drugs. That is a necessary move, particularly at a time when there is widespread abuse of different drug substances.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which is often brought to our attention is the erratic driving by motorcyclists, particularly those travelling on heavy motorcycles and in convoys at high speed. These people frighten drivers of other motor vehicles. I hope more strong and stern action will be taken to deal with these people who are a danger to themselves and to other road users.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Road Traffic Bill which is being introduced in this House adds to the general corpus of legislation in relation to the Road Traffic Acts. The Minister mentioned specifically that he intends introducing regulations on the control of driving instruction, which I welcome. It is absolutely essential that before people acquire a full driver's licence, or learner drivers, should have to take lessons. There is a pilot scheme in my county where a voluntary group has established a driving academy, working in partnership with the County Partnership Board. This gives young people, particularly those who come from households with limited income, the opportunity to avail of driving lessons. That group has targeted youths who may be at risk of becoming involved in less desirable activities. It gives them an opportunity to acquire motor skills and driving licences.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the penalty points system. In reading through the Minister's script, I was surprised the system is not operational in more countries. I hope it will have the <Col N="483" /> desired effect here. The Minister is confident it has been successful in the countries in which it has been adopted.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, there has been a reduction in deaths and injuries on the roads in recent years but, unfortunately, any road death or injury is one statistic too many. I would not have thought there was a reduction in the level of deaths and injuries in recent years. Every week-end morning, including too many week day mornings, we hear the grim news of another fatality in some county, or the fatality of someone we may know well ourselves. I hope the rigorous enforcement of this legislation, together with the subsequent regulations, will ensure the roads are safer for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Road Traffic Bill, 2001 as an important addition to the legislative basis for the safe use of the nation's road network. That legislative basis seeks to control the behaviour of road users to deal with the safety of vehicles and to provide for traffic signs and safety-related infrastructure.   We expect penalties and driver disqualification orders to promote compliance. As the Minister said, the existing code is based mainly on the Road Traffic Act, 1961. However, this legislation derives principally from the Government's five year national strategy for road safety, which underpins legislation and policy in this area and, it is fair to acknowledge, has been quite successful.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, we have had a pretty comprehensive code in relation to drink driving and, perhaps more importantly, we have reached a stage where drink driving is far less acceptable among one's peers that might have been the case a few years ago. We speak much more about drink driving and less about drunken driving, which is an important distinction. However, as a number of speakers said, more and more people are suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. There does not appear to be an adequate testing system, if any, for people driving in that condition. The evidence which is available strongly suggests that it is equally as dangerous, if not even more dangerous, than driving under the influence of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the control of traffic by way of legislation is the use of speed limit controls. These controls are frequently criticised, mainly because the 60 mile per hour speed limit, which is the universal one outside of built-up areas and motorways, for some roads is perhaps too low and for a great many others, particularly county roads and some regional roads, is far too high. That is an area which brings the law into disrepute because anyone with common sense would say it may well be quite safe to drive at 70 or 75 miles per hour on a dual carriageway, where the 60 mile an hour speed limit obtains, while exactly <Col N="484" /> the same speed limit obtains on minor county roads which join it. Likewise, people are very critical of the 70 mile per hour speed limit on motorways. There is some scope for increasing that. The rationale for doing that would be to shorten the length of journeys because, ultimately, one of the huge contributors to excessive speeding is the fact that people must spend so much time in their cars travelling relatively modest distances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to the time it takes to travel between Donegal and Dublin. The same applies to anywhere in the west. It is not unusual to have the experience I and several other Deputies had last Friday of leaving here at 3 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. and not reaching one's county boundary until 9.30 p.m. That is a huge amount of time to spend driving. Apart from the frustration of spending so long behind the wheel, there is the additional burden of tiredness which is bound to affect drivers.</P>
    <P>While one frequently hears criticisms of the Garda for not sufficiently enforcing traffic law, the Minister quoted statistics which I thought were quite startling in regard to the enforcement of the law in 2000. There were 224,000 fines for on-the-spot speeding; I presume some of them were caught on camera but a huge majority were caught by the gardaí; 59,000 offences of non-wearing of seat belts seems an absolutely huge number. I thought we were long past the point where people realised the importance of wearing seat belts and where almost everyone has a reflex reaction on sitting into a car, particularly drivers, of automatically putting on the seat belt or instructing passengers to do likewise. There were 104,000 drink driving offences brought before the courts, which is a horrendously high number. This gives the lie to my earlier contention that considerable progress is being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the introduction of new deterrents and a substantial review upwards of the financial penalties. It also provides for something which has been talked about for a very long time, that is, the penalty points system for relatively minor traffic offences. I am pleased the Bill provides that these tot up to quite large points penalties if one goes to court in relation to the offence because far too much court time has been taken up with road traffic offences over a number of years. It is important that as far as possible administration of this area is moved out of the courts. I realise there have been difficulties in this regard because of legal and constitutional considerations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the advocacy of the carrot and stick policy proposed by a number of speakers. There is a great deal of merit in the carrot and stick approach in the case of car insurance costs for young people. It is wrong to penalise people who have no offences or crashes registered against them. That is something that should be <Col N="485" /> very carefully looked at. By whatever means, young people who avoid incurring penalty points and accidents should have insurance provided to them at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties encountered by people trying to promote better driving and road safety is that people do not seem to believe the statistics. They may believe the numbers of those killed and injured because the proof is there, but they do not appear to believe the causes of the accidents. Until people believe that speeding, drink driving and the other matters dealt with in this legislation are the factors which cause deaths and injuries, it will be difficult to make progress. Enforcement alone is not enough to change behaviour. I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith that there is a considerable waste of Garda manpower and time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace for being in the House at this late hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase is general insurance is very serious, whether it is for cars, lorries, homes or <Col N="486" /> anything else. The issue to which I wish to refer is insurance for hackney drivers. A few weeks ago I was advised of a hackney operator whose insurance for third party, fire and theft on a car worth £6,500 was £1,900 in 2000 but increased to £3,300 this year. He is now waiting to renew his other insurance. Yesterday another hackney operator gave me renewal notices for his minibuses for 2001, the cost was well over £9,000 while it was well under £4,000 last year. The cost of insurance for another car, with a different company, increased from £1,150 to £4,850 in two years. He was offered an instalment plan with interest of 17%.</P>
    <P>Can any business carry this level of increase? Can this House stand idly by and watch as hackney operators are forced out of business. The car with almost £5,000 in insurance costs would have to travel 11,000 miles to pay for that insurance alone. I have received a copy of an explanation from one insurance company which reads:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, due to the unprecedented rise in claims costs, motor insurance premiums across the board will increase this year. Our Bus &amp; Coach Insurance Programme is no exception and I regret that we have had to impose a &ldquo;claims factor&rdquo; loading on all of our clients.</P>
    <P>The increase in traffic. the appallingly low standards of driving, and the inflation in wages, medical and legal costs have combined to produce the worst results in the motor industry for some time. We aim to reduce this increase over the next three years through your good management, continued loyalty to the programme, driver training at advanced level and major group discount packages &ndash; all to be introduced during 2001.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and at this time, our premium reflects these increases. I do hope you understand the position and our obligation to always protect your interests through the provision of a strong, solvent and reliable Bus &amp; Coach Insurance Programme.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister made any inquiries as to why there are increases such as that from £1,100 to £5,000 in two years? Have insurance companies got a free hand to charge what they like? Has the Minister had any meetings with them? I hope the long awaited Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which is currently before the House, will improve driving standards. The Government must give some immediate support, especially in rural areas where there is no alternative transport.</P>
    <P>When the aviation industry was affected following 11 September, special arrangements were made. There is no doubt the events of 11 September had some influence on insurance pre<Col N="487" /> miums. Some support or intervention with the insurance companies must happen immediately if the hackney industry is to survive, especially in Border areas. Already there are quite a few cars working there and I question whether they are all working under the same regulations, or if the Garda Síochána are fully implementing the rules they are supposed to oversee. The hackney industry has increased in size in recent years since new drink-driving regulations were introduced. The industry provides a good service at all hours of day and night. The availability of a good hackney service is vital to ensure that young lives are saved. If the service is not available more drivers may take chances under the influence of alcohol and we have all seen the results of that.</P>
    <P>Emergency legislation is before the House to pay an insurance increase for Aer Lingus. Can the Minister do the same for hackneys? Otherwise even more cars will give a service without proper insurance and operate under ordinary private insurance without hackney plates. Insurance claims have cost more in legal terms than compensation paid. Urgent action is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past two months there have been numerous letters and telephone calls from the public and from businesses indicating that motor, liability and property insurance premiums have increased substantially in the period. The latest CSO figures are for mid-October and therefore would not fully reflect the events in New York on 11 September. Nevertheless, for house insurance they show an increase of 11% as compared with mid-October 2000 and an increase of 27% for motors. These statistics reflect the market as a whole. I am aware that individuals and businesses are facing increases that are much larger than this. I understand many businesses and individuals are experiencing extreme difficulty in meeting these increased premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons, international and domestic, for the sharp increases in the past two months. Insurance is a cyclical business, and it has been generally agreed that after a number of years of technical losses, the industry, both in Ireland and elsewhere, is entering a phase of the cycle where prices are increasing. That effect has been intensified by the events of 11 September. Reinsurers in particular have borne the brunt of the cost of the events in New York and have had to increase rates to compensate. These events also point to an increased risk in certain types of cover, including cover against losses from terrorist attacks. Reinsurers have reconsidered the <Col N="488" /> cover they are prepared to underwrite and have introduced restrictions. The net effect for consumers is that the cost of insurance cover has increased dramatically and the availability of cover has contracted.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs are also related to the cost of settling claims. These costs are high in Ireland because most compensation for personal injury is paid through a private insurance system rather than the social welfare and public health systems. Two recent High Court judgments may have the effect of increasing awards in outstanding as well as future cases, thus requiring insurers to strengthen existing reserves. Of the total cost of settling personal injury claims in Ireland, an estimated 40% is accounted for by legal expenses.</P>
    <P>It is clear that insurance costs can only be reduced by tackling their underlying causes. The Government has a number of initiatives to reduce claim costs, thus reducing insurance costs. These initiatives include measures, including the Road Traffic Bill, to reduce motor accidents, the strengthening of the HSA and the promotion with the social partners of the workplace safety initiative to reduce accidents in the workplace.</P>
    <P>There are two initiatives specifically related to insurance. The Government has decided establish a personal injuries assessment tribunal so as to reduce the costs of delivery of personal injury compensation. I should stress that there is no intention to reduce the amount of compensation to injured parties. An interdepartmental implementation group, charged with progressing the establishment of the PIAB expects to report close to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The motor insurance advisory board was set up to advise on motor insurance issues generally and to report on premiums charged for motor insurance, with particular reference to the relationship between premiums charged to different categories of driver and the claims experience for that category. That board will report close to the end of the year and its findings are awaited with interest.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some taxi drivers have been quoted greatly increased premiums. Unfortunately, so have other policyholders, including other businesses that provide employment. Clearly, the Government cannot intervene on behalf of one category of insurance policyholder, especially when all categories are experiencing similar difficulties. I would encourage policyholders, including taxi drivers, to seek as many quotations as possible either through broker channels or directly from insurers. I would urge insurers on the other hand to explain clearly to their clients why increases, when unavoidable, are necessary and to discuss risk minimising stra<Col N="489" /> tegies with their clients with a view to moderating premium rates.</P>

      <P>Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and John Gormley have given notice of their intention to raise the matter of the closure and threatened closure of local post offices in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this issue because of the imminent closure of the post office at Sandymount in Dublin. This follows either the closure or the threatened closure of a number of post offices in Dublin. In Dublin South East alone that includes Merrion and Baggot Street. Donnybrook and Terenure have been under threat and some post offices have closed for a number of months and then reopened. We have a very uncertain picture as far as the service is concerned for local people.</P>
      <P>The proposed closure of the post office in Sandymount has caused much concern and disappointment in the locality. This post office is central to the local community, particularly the elderly. Senior representatives of An Post have confirmed that there is a slight extension to this service in Sandymount but it is unlikely to go on beyond January. I ask the Minister to outline what is Government policy in relation to these post offices. The nearest alternative post office to Sandymount is in Ringsend. There is a crisis in public transport in the area and it can take a long time for people to complete their business in different post offices.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a high demand for post office services. If one goes into any of them, there are long queues. Last Saturday I was in both Rathmines and Ranelagh post offices and there were queues of 15 or 20 people waiting half an hour for services. We must ask the Government what their proposals are on the staffing of post offices.</P>
      <P>There seems to be difficulty getting people to staff the post offices and I wonder why that issue has not been addressed in the past year. I ask the Minister if there are any plans to put together a realistic strategy to address the problems that exist. It appears that employment in the post offices is not seen as a viable option for members of the local community. An Post says that there is little profit for those who choose to run post offices after they have paid their staff and overheads. Surely there should be an incentive plan to encourage local people to be involved and make it financially viable to run these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a valuable local service and I ask the Minister to outline what plans are in place to <Col N="490" /> ensure that local post offices in the Dublin area survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Due primarily to pressure from the Green Party and from other groups, the Sandymount post office will remain open until January. However, it is essential that the long-term future of the post office is secured. The post office is vital for the village of Sandymount where we have seen dramatic changes over the years including the destruction of the church, the disappearance of the fish shop to be replaced by a dingy pub and cutbacks in public transport which have resulted in the loss of certain bus routes.</P>
      <P>If we lose the post office, it would be a serious blow to all of us who enjoy the village, but particularly to our senior citizens who are the most frequent users. This is why I have campaigned so vigorously for its retention. I have spoken to the Minister and senior members of An Post. At the moment, An Post has agreed to staff the post office until January but in the long-term we need a permanent postmaster. I hope that when the premises is sold the new owners will apply for the job, understanding the significance of the post office for Sandymount.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has brought unforeseen difficulties. The price of property has escalated and it is increasingly difficult to find quality staff. This could present a problem for the new owners. The post office section of An Post is running at a deficit. It has argued that it is operating a commercial enterprise and not a social service but I believe An Post and the Government have a responsibility to our communities. I remind the Government of its slogan at the last election that it would put people before politics. If it is to do so, it is essential that the network of post offices which are so vital to our villages are retained. It should not be that the mighty buck and the bottom line dictate policy all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fitzgerald and Gormley for raising this matter. May I point out that the present policy is that there should be no post office closures? However, vacancies within the network arise as a result of illness, death or retirement. In such cases, An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively, canvasses for suitable persons to fill the positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found that a post office is closed on a temporary basis pending an application from such a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February last year the Minister requested Phil Flynn to carry out a review of the sub-post office network in the context of the Government's explicit commitment to the retention of the rural sub-post office network in the White Paper on Rural Development and given the fact <Col N="491" /> that regional and rural development are cornerstones of this Government's economic and social development policy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn's terms of reference were two-fold. First, to review the financial and business environment of the sub-post office network which included sub-post offices in Dublin and, second, to examine options and make recommendations on the sustainable development of the rural sub-post office network against the background of the obligation of An Post to provide a nationwide service.</P>
    <P>The facts outlined in the report are stark. The company operates a network of 1,914 offices. This is the highest<i> per capita </i>in the EU. Ninety-seven of these are staffed by the company and 1,117 are sub-contracted offices. A significant proportion of these sub-offices are loss making, with a very small volume of transactions. The post office division made a loss of nearly £3 million in 2000 on a turnover of £3 million. Due to increasing costs and falling margins, further significant losses are projected by the management of An Post based on current tariffs and the existing network structure, rising from £12 million this year to nearly £28 million in 2004. Total losses over the four-year period 2001-04 are forecast at nearly £80 million. These projections have been independently verified as accurate.</P>
    <P>Finally, the post office division is dependent on just three contracts for 80% of its revenue; they are the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for welfare payments, the National Treasury Management Agency for savings certificates and RTE for licence fee collection. These customers are held on their short-term contracts, all of which are either currently or shortly up for renewal. The implications of the report for the network is clear. The current situation which I have briefly outlined is unsustainable and threatens the continuation of the existing level of services as well as the future viability of An Post. The Government and the Irish Postmasters' Union agree that remedial action is urgently required to ensure the future of the network and the widest range of quality services to its customers.</P>
    <P>The Flynn report outlined a wide range of scenarios, options and recommendations to guarantee the future viability of the network. In light of the report the Minister announced on 4 April last that the Government had decided to establish an interdepartmental group to assess options for the long-term viability of post office services. The group's report, published in July, provides the framework for the development of a viable post office network service which meets the requirements of both the customer and the operator. In the context of the report the Government has <Col N="492" /> agreed that short-term actions by An Post need to focus on the pilot introduction of postal agency arrangements and second, that in situations where it is impossible to continue a post office service on an agency basis a Government services outlet network should be developed, having regard to the availability of already existing equivalent community-based or statutory services, to meet the needs of the community within each county.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government agreed to increase the share capital of An Post by 10 million on the basis that this would facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms, in particular through payment of the increase for sub-postmasters recommended in the Flynn report which has been implemented by An Post this month. The increase in share capital is subject to clearance by the EU Commission as it may constitute a State aid. We have, therefore, made a submission to the EU Commission for clearance under the State aid regime. The Minister has also met representatives of the Commission to press Ireland's case for an early and positive response to our request.</P>
    <P>The Minister also established a partnership forum, chaired by Phil Flynn, to oversee the developments in the network. The IPU, An Post and the relevant Departments are participating in the forum and the Minister is confident it will make a constructive input into overcoming the difficulties faced by the network.</P>

    <P>It is easy to overlook the positive side of developments in the network. Business has grown more than 34% for An Post since it was established as a commercial State company. Prudent <Col N="493" /> investment in automation has equipped the company to be at the forefront of the electronic payments revolution. This is reflected in the agreement with the banks earlier this year in relation to bill-pay facilities and recently with the TSB for counter payment services.</P>
    <P>A further very positive development for the network and especially for the rural customer, given the number of bank branch closures, was announced by AIB today. The bank is to link up with An Post in a joint initiative which will see a thousand post office outlets becoming agents for the bank from July 2002. AIB personal customers will be able to lodge cash to and withdraw cash from their accounts using their local post office.</P>
    <P>I refer to one of the first commitments the Minister gave, when appointed in June 1997, concerning the post office network. She promised that there would not be a forced closures of post offices. The position has not changed since then. The Minister and the Government remain committed to a viable and competitive post office network. The Minister fully appreciates the work undertaken by postmasters and post-mistresses over the years in terms of providing excellent services to the customer, particularly in rural areas. The Government is committed to ensuring that the public service ethos offered by the post office network will remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the ongoing threat to the elderly of evictions from nursing homes because of the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to allow health boards to pay subventions at rates to meet each individual set of circumstances.</P>
      <P>Services for older people in Ireland fall short of adequate standards. They are characterised by huge gaps, by queues and waiting lists and by unaffordable costs. The facts are: the population aged over 65 in Ireland is growing rapidly and is forecast to increase by 400,000 by the year 2030, an increase of 50%; at present, less than half of full time carers receive any financial support from the State; access to long-stay residential care is highly arbitrary and inequitable and an adequate preventative health strategy has not been developed to manage the problems of older age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Older people must be encouraged to live in their own homes and communities with the adequate supports available to them. In the Southern Health Board area there are 18,000 elderly people living alone and only 35% receive home help. In addition, there are currently only 187 public health nurses serving the entire population of elderly in the Southern Health Board <Col N="494" /> region. Many families with an elderly relative very often find that the necessary support required to keep an elderly person at home is not there and the family is often left with no alternative but nursing home care. At the moment the total number of elderly receiving the nursing home subvention in the Southern Health Board region is 721. The average subvention is only £131 per week with families often struggling to make up the shortfall of up to £300 per week.</P>
    <P>At present, less than half of full-time carers receive any financial support from the State. In the Southern Health Board area there are only 76 respite beds, which serve the entire elderly population. This week again patients fear that they are facing discharge from a private nursing home in Cork while, at the same time, families throughout the country are accumulating massive debts with private nursing homes simply because we have a Minister for Health and Children who is failing to make decisions on the review of the nursing homes subvention scheme undertaken by his Department in association with the Department of Finance. The Minister's failure to make decisions means we are now in a crisis where elderly people are being threatened with eviction and families are living in fear. The Minister is well aware of this serious situation but is failing to act.</P>
    <P>The Minister publicly said in early June that he would not be bounced into a decision regarding enhanced subventions but his failure since then to make decisions means that elderly persons are afraid they will be bounced out of nursing homes. The Minister, who is a member of the Government with vast resources at his disposal, is effectively abandoning the elderly. The very people who built our economy are now being left in a hopeless situation. The Minister's failure to act has also brought about a situation where a high percentage of acute hospital beds in all public hospitals are occupied by elderly people who cannot be discharged back home because they need nursing care. They cannot be accommodated in nursing homes because the beds are not available. This results in seriously sick people being unable to get into hospital and obtain treatment because of the occupied beds.</P>
    <P>This situation is making the waiting list crisis even worse so I am now asking the Minister for Health and Children to take immediate decisions to increase allocations for health boards right throughout the country so that the nursing homes subvention scheme can be implemented as recommended by the Ombudsman's report, which was scathing in its criticism of the Minister and his Department. The Minister must also make immediate decisions on the expenditure review of the nursing homes subvention scheme undertaken by his Department in association with the Department of Finance and completed since <Col N="495" /> last June. I also demand that the Minister guarantees here tonight that he will make the resources available to the health boards to implement the Ombudsman's recommendations in relation to the refund scheme for families who were obliged to sell family properties and exhaust family savings for their elderly parents and relations because of irregular decisions made by health boards arising from directives from the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are private arrangements between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional funding has been provided by Governments since its introduction in 1993. In 1994, in the first full year of the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme, £12 million was made available. In 1997, when the Government came to office, £27 million was allocated. This year, an additional £14 million was <Col N="496" /> provided by my Department, bringing the amount available for the scheme to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Southern Health Board, Deputy Allen will be aware that the board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for each board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it should be noted that the nursing home subvention regulations do not specify a maximum amount to be paid in respect of enhanced subvention. A decision relating to the amount to be paid is a matter for each health board, following assessment on a case by case basis and bearing in mind their obligation to comply with Article 20 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, as well as the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996. Article 20 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations provides that if, under section 31 of the Health Act, 1970, the Minister specifies a limit on the expenditure to be incurred in providing services under the Act, a board may pay such amounts as would enable it to contain its expenditure within the specified limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in due course in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. As announced in the health strategy, which was published on Monday, it is also the intention of my Department to amend the nursing home subvention scheme to take account of the expenditure review of the scheme and to introduce a pilot home sub<Col N="497" /> vention scheme in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This will be carried out in the context of an integrated approach to meeting the needs of ageing and older people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have specifically referred to Kilkenny County Council but my remarks are directed at the schemes operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Health and Children. I refer specifically to the disabled person's grant scheme, the essential repairs grant, the scheme for improvement works in lieu of local authority housing which is operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the scheme for the elderly operated by the Department of Health and Children through the health boards. Each of these schemes has been developed in a piecemeal way over the years, leading to confusion, bureaucracy, overlapping and bad value for money. It is time we looked at the individual schemes and tried to focus on bringing them into one scheme that would look after the elderly and vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is operated by Kilkenny County Council in my area. Looking at the Book of Estimates presented to the council, the estimate provided for those grants is nothing short of disastrous. A report has to be referred by the council to an occupational therapist, who is employed by the health board. As a result, there is a delay, another cost and another level of bureaucracy. The matter goes back to the council, where there is an engineer's report and a foreman is involved. Then the work starts. The maximum grant allowable under the scheme is £16,000. Because of the limited amount of money, the time factor and the administrative waste, there is a shortage of funding not just for the year concerned, but on 1 January 2002, when the new funding comes in, Kilkenny County Council will have that entire budget spent almost immediately. That deals with those on the list already &ndash; there is no scope for additional applications during the year.</P>
      <P>The essential repairs grant is a scheme that remains a mystery to me although I have been on the council since 1974. The scheme is complicated, there is very little money involved and it is practically impossible to qualify for it. Why we have all these schemes, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The scheme for works in lieu of local authority housing is different and is administered by the councils but each individual application has to go to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for approval. One can imagine the lengthy process involved for applicants and councils in getting approval from central Government. It is a waste of time and a sham.</P>
    <P>The health boards operate the scheme for the elderly, which involves a maximum of £2,000 and generally allows small works on windows or doors. The funding for this scheme is usually exhausted by the beginning of each year.</P>
    <P>Various Departments are involved, the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance, but is it high time we brought all these together and had one scheme which would serve our requirements? It should not be aspirational for people to want proper heating, windows and doors and a downstairs shower for those who cannot use stairs. It is time we put all this together as, although there is possibly enough money going into the scheme, too much of it is being wasted on administrative costs and on layers of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I have argued for a long time that the fund for the free fuel scheme, administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, should be increased. I believe the scheme should be included in the overall review I seek. A single Department should have responsibility of looking after a proper scheme, in which all moneys would be pooled. There is much more I could say about this issue, but my primary purpose in raising this matter was to try to focus the minds of those in the various Departments. They should come together to provide a decent scheme which serves those in need and not those who administer it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Aylward for raising this matter. The disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes are administered by local authorities in accordance with a framework laid down in statutory regulations which is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities administering the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the disabled person's grant scheme, grants are available from local authorities to adapt existing houses to meet the needs of disabled people. The scheme is designed to provide a substantial incentive to carry out necessary adaptations or improvements to dwellings to facilitate disabled persons. A grant of 90% of the approved cost of the work is available in the case of a privately owned house while the grant generally covers the entire cost of works in a local authority tenanted dwelling. The essential repairs grant scheme enables approved applicants for <Col N="499" /> local authority housing, living in accommodation which cannot be made suitable in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic repairs carried out to their houses so they can enjoy an acceptable standard of accommodation. The grant covers 100% of the cost of the work.</P>
    <P>The Government has introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of both these schemes on three occasions since coming into office. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled person's grant scheme has doubled from £8,000 to £16,000 and the grant under the essential repairs grant scheme has increased from £1,800 to £7,500. The recoupment rate has also been increased, as in November 1998 local authorities were recouped 50% of grants paid, but now they are recouped two thirds of the amount, up to a maximum of £10,667 for the disabled person's grant and £5,000 for the essential repairs grant.</P>
    <P>The amount payable in respect of disabled persons or essential repairs is a matter for local authorities, as the schemes are funded from authorities' own resources, within constraints imposed by the amount included for that purpose in the authorities' estimates of expenditure. Authorities have to determine the funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within overall allocations by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for house purchase and improvement loans, disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant. The allocations are based on estimates of demand for the schemes provided by the authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authority capital receipts, surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing programme and the remedial works scheme, can be <Col N="500" /> used to meet the authority's portion of the grants paid under the disabled person's and essential repairs grants schemes, with the Minister's approval. The Department of the Environment and Local Government's involvement in the schemes relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The recoupment by the Department, as I have stated, to the local authority is two thirds of the grant paid. The significant improvements to the terms and conditions of both of these schemes, together with significant increases in funding from the Department, have resulted in a much higher level of activity under the schemes. In 1997, the Department recouped a total of about £5.28 million to local authorities, a figure which increased to £16.14 million in 2000. An allocation of £24,726,000 has been provided this year.</P>
    <P>In line with significant increases in the Department's provision for these schemes, recoupment to Kilkenny County Council has increased substantially. This increase has resulted in increased activity under both schemes within the authority's area. In 1997, the county council paid 39 disabled person's grants, but so far this year there have been 67 payments under the scheme. Some 28 payments were made in 1997 to people in County Kilkenny under the essential repairs grants scheme, compared to 44 payments to date this year. The position regarding grant assistance under the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes will be kept under review. Deputy Aylward made some interesting points, which I will convey to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. We will take a close look at the situation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 November 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by IBEC and CIF regarding the implications of delays in implementing the national development plan; if he discussed these concerns with IBEC at his meeting with the body on 22 October 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have noted the positive endorsement of the key infrastructural objectives of the NDP by both IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation in urging the Government to continue with the timely implementation of the plan. The matter was discussed at the meetings I had with both IBEC and the CIF on 22 October.</P>
      <P>As I stated to IBEC and the CIF, and as I have already indicated in answer to an earlier question, the NDP is a seven year programme. It specifically provided that year on year allocations may need to be modified in the context of the budgetary parameters and available resources. In relation to infrastructure, the economic and social infrastructure programme of the NDP, which sets down in current prices the indicative allocation of resources for each of the seven years of the plan, provided for total Exchequer and EU investment of 7.95 billion for the period 2000 to 2002. Based on the recently published Abridged Estimates and the outturns for 2000 and 2001 there will be a total Exchequer investment of some 8 billion over the first three years of the plan in the infrastructure programme, which is fully in line with that promised in the published operational programme.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer is, therefore, honouring its funding obligations in respect of the infrastructural programme under the plan. This reflects the importance attached by the Government to tackling the country's infrastructural deficit through the ambitious programme set out in the plan. I welcome the continuing support of IBEC and the CIF for this objective.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in reply to a parliamentary question on 24 October put down by Deputy Howlin, I informed the House that the board of ACC Bank plc had recommended to me that it should proceed to sale contract negotiations with Rabobank Nederland and that I had approved its recommendation. I also stated that I was looking forward to receiving the board's recommendation following completion of the negotiations. I am still awaiting this recommendation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, contract negotiations are ongoing between the two banks and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way on these negotiations until such time as they are completed and I have received the recommendation from the board. If the board's recommendation is acceptable, I will take the matter to Government and, in due course, under section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 2001, I will seek a motion of approval from the House before proceeding with the sale of my shares in the bank. As previously stated, details of the board's recommendation will then be given to each Member of the House prior to the date of the motion to allow Deputies reach a fully informed view.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have begun the process of using powers, provided by the Finance Act 1999, to identify the holders of bogus accounts. Revenue has lodged papers with the High Court seeking the first in a series of orders of the Court requiring the financial institutions concerned to supply names, addresses and other relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the commissioners that any estimation of the number or value of the remaining accounts, in advance of the results of them using the powers given by the 1999 Act to identify the account holders concerned, would be unreliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners have emphasised that the estimates of the number or value of bogus <Col N="503" /> accounts previously mentioned &ndash; 25,000 or more accounts &ndash; are, of necessity, no more than the broadest of estimates, nor does it follow that every holder of such an account will have a tax liability.</P>
    <P>I have sanctioned a significant increase in Revenue staff resources in the past year. Some 850 staff will be engaged in the audit and investigation area, which is an increase of some 160 staff over last year's level. I understand the commissioners will keep the position as regards resources under review. They have stressed that Revenue will continue with normal audit work and with the other major investigations in which it is involved. The commissioners have indicated publicly that, if they should need more resources, they will ask for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 42 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's cash changeover plan outlines the main measures in place to ensure a smooth changeover to the euro. On 1 January 2002, accounts in banks, building societies, post offices and credit unions will be converted to euro free of charge. From then on withdrawals from accounts will be in euro; ATMs will begin dispensing euro notes; wages, salaries, pensions and social welfare payments will be in euro; banks, building societies, post offices and, where feasible, credit unions for members, will exchange IR£ cash for euro and will continue to accept IR£ cash in lodgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key requirement for retailers is that, from 1 January 2002, they charge only in euro and give change only in euro. Several features of the plan are aimed at facilitating retailers in this regard. The dual circulation period is less than six week long, and it is expected that the bulk of cash transactions will be in euro by the end of two weeks. ATMs will initially dispense mainly ten and 20 euro notes &ndash; more than 80% of ATMs <Col N="504" /> should be dispensing euro notes by the evening of 1 January &ndash; and in the first week of January, social welfare payments made at post offices will generally include at least four five-euro notes. These measures will help to put low-value notes into circulation quickly, so helping retailers as regards giving change in euro.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of other measures have also been put in place. Banks will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002, and will not charge cash lodgement charges on Irish notes and coins lodged by retailers between 1 January and 15 February. In addition, banks will not debit retailers' accounts for the advance euro cash provided to them, until 2 January 2002 at the very earliest.</P>
    <P>Starter packs of euro coins will go on sale to the public from mid December. These packs will help people to familiarise themselves with the euro coins before they go into circulation and should also help to facilitate a smooth changeover. The Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has been providing extensive information to the retail sector. Very large numbers of a guide to help retailers to plan for the changeover have been distributed since the spring, both directly to retailers and by various other channels. Forfás has also distributed a retail training kit to every retailer. The kit includes a euro calculator; a ready reckoner; a handy conversion chart; dummy notes and coins for training purposes; and posters for display in-store, as well as a training manual.</P>
    <P>Forfás have also worked closely with FÁS, which is providing euro training for retailers and sales assistants. The training is being delivered at local level in FÁS training centres, locally in major towns, in urban shopping centres and where appropriate on retailers' premises.</P>
    <P>Forfás also sent a leaflet on cash management to retailers in August, and a further pack of leaflets will start to issue to retailers this week covering the final key messages. The public is being advised, through the euro handbook and through leaflets that will be widely distributed, how we can all as individuals help to make the changeover run smoothly.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's question, from estimates supplied to my Department in respect of Departments and relevant bodies, the cost to the Exchequer of the changeover to the euro is estimated to be of the order of £100 million, approximately 127 million. Changeover costs are of course once-off, whereas economic and monetary union confers ongoing benefits.</P>
    <P>As regards public awareness, survey results indicate that substantial majorities of the public have seen pictures of the euro notes and coins and know the date of introduction of euro cash and the value of the Irish pound in euro; and know that the euro is made up of cent, that they will receive their change in euro from 1 January, and that euro notes and coins can be used in all the euro countries. I should add that the Euro <Col N="505" /> Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, has been carrying out a very extensive public information campaign on the changeover. As part of this, a handbook on the euro changeover was sent to households in October, and An Post expects to complete distribution of an electronic converter to households by 10 December. These initiatives will build on the public's existing levels of awareness in the run-up to the changeover. In addition, the ECBI is distributing more than half a million information items a month, is running an extensive advertising campaign, and operates a LoCall helpline and a website.</P>
    <P>Finally, bank drafts are prepaid instruments and there is no time limit on their validity. After 1 January 2002, Irish financial institutions will continue to accept Irish pound drafts that are dated on or before 31 December 2001. Value will be given in euro when they are presented for lodgment or encashment. However, in the interests of facilitating the early changeover to euro, it would be advisable that this be done, where possible, before 9 February 2002.</P>

The Marine laboratories will be located at Oranmore, County Galway on a site previously occupied by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the costs of acquiring are expected to be minimal. The estimated construction cost of the new laboratories in Galway is £31 million including inflation, fees and VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an agreement at departmental council, staff representatives are informed of the outcome of every meeting of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and which is responsible for overseeing the relocation of laboratory facilities from Abbotstown. In line with Government policy no compensation or removal expenses will be paid to civil servants volunteering to relocate to Backweston and Galway. However, non-Civil Service fixed contract staff <Col N="506" /> working at the Marine Institute who do not wish to move will benefit from a severance package which is being negotiated. The precise costs of this package will not be known until final agreement is reached.</P>

Nor, therefore, am I in a position to comment on the likelihood of any particular location being included in the programme. What I can say, however, is that consideration is obviously being given to the selection of particular locations for inclusion in the programme as well as the basis on which such locations will be selected. I am aware of the very many well made cases for such inclusion and, in that regard, that the case made in favour of County Cavan will be given full consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gender equality policy restates the strong commitment of the Civil Service to gender equality. As a first step, the policy requires individual Departments to set strategic objectives and equality goals for increasing women's representation at all levels, but in particular at the higher management grades where women are under-represented. This is being done in departmental strategy statements.</P>
      <P>To focus the policy, the Government has set a target for the key assistant principal grade. Departments must work to ensure that, by 2005, 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women. At present, women fill only 27% of these posts. The aim is to ensure there will be more women who can be promoted to senior levels.</P>
      <P>The policy also requires Departments to set goals to deal with obstacles to career progression for women at all levels. Initiatives will be taken in the main human resource areas.</P>
      <P>The equality unit in my Department will support other Departments with the implementation of the policy. The unit will meet Departments to assist them in introducing the policy. The aim is to exchange ideas and to help each other in what needs to be done. The unit will prepare a short report outlining what has been done and suggesting the further steps that might be taken.</P>
      <P>In the Department of Finance, targets have been set which, over the next five years and subject to the number of vacancies arising, should see the representation of women increasing from 28% to close to 35% in the assistant principal grade and from 14% to close to 25% at the principal grade. A policy is being prepared for the Department which will address a wide range of equality issues.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article to which the Deputy refers, and have read it with interest. It is inaccurate, however, to suggest that I am cutting back on <Col N="508" /> infrastructural spending. In fact, current projections will see another year-on-year increase in capital spending to ensure infrastructural deficits will not cause us to lose competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Government remains committed to implementing the NDP especially in the key area of infrastructure. The recently published AEV honours the Exchequer's obligation to funding of the infrastructure operational programme of the NDP. Based on the Estimates published and the outturns for 2000 and 2001 there will be a total Exchequer investment of some 8 billion over the first three years of the plan in the infrastructure programme which is in line with that promised in the published programme.</P>
      <P>Regarding the payment to the national pensions reserve fund, I am statutorily required to put at least 1% of GNP per annum into the fund. It would perhaps be useful if I briefly set out the reasons for the establishment of the fund. Due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates we are set to experience a significant ageing of our population over the next half century. This increased dependency ratio will give rise to serious budgetary issues. In particular, it will put severe strain on the capacity of future Governments to continue to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis. During the debate on the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, I set out for the House my Department's projections on the likely scale of increased pension costs as follows. The Exchequer cost of public service and social welfare pensions in the year 2000 was 4.7% of GNP; by 2026 the Exchequer cost of broadly maintaining this level of pension provision will rise to 8.1% of GNP; and by 2056 this cost will have risen to 12.4% of GNP. The increase which we are facing in pension costs is a known liability. I take the view that one should budget for such known liabilities. The establishment of the national pensions reserve fund marks a radical departure in the management of the public finances and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning. The statutory 1% contribution is central to the success of the fund and I remain committed to it. The credit rating agency, Standard &amp; Poors upgraded Ireland's long-term sovereign debt rating to triple A this year. In announcing the upgrade, Standard &amp; Poors stated, &ldquo;The sustained decline in the public sector debt burden and the creation of the national pension reserve fund provide ample fiscal flexibility to meet the challenge of an ageing population. This places Ireland, with its relatively favourable demographic profile, in a better position than most EU members&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, primary ministerial responsibility for the dormant accounts scheme is now vested in my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. As the scheme is due to come into operation next March, much is being done to ensure that once the first accounts are deemed dormant at that time, the mechanisms provided for in the Act, designed to notify account holders and to monitor compliance on the part of the institutions, are immediately effective. I am informed that officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are preparing the commencement order which will give formal effect to the provisions of the Act. I understand that the order should be signed shortly. I am also informed that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun work on arrangements to establish the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, provided for under section 30 of the 2001 Act. I understand that it is the intention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that his Department will undertake a consultative process to ascertain interest in membership of the board.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the 2001 Act obliges credit institutions to arrange for publication of a notice, in the form prescribed by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in two or more daily newspapers and the Iris Oifigiúil, advising the general public of the scheme. The first such notice is scheduled to be placed next 30 April. Discussions on the form of this notice are under way between my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, as well as the representative bodies of the financial sector. When these discussions have concluded, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will make the necessary regulations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also recall that I undertook, during the enactment stages of this legislation, to run a public awareness initiative to bring the scheme to the attention of the public at large. I intended that this would be once-off advertisements which would reassure the public &ndash; in particular, the elderly and infirm who may not get into their banks or building societies often &ndash; that the State was not depriving them in any way. Work on this initiative is well under way, and I hope it can be published by mid-February next year, after the launch of the euro. It is my intention that the advertisements to be placed should be as clear and informative as possible, and should serve to reassure the public of their rights under the 2001 Act.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the first and final reports of the Public Accounts Committee Sub-Committee inquiry into DIRT contained a large number of recommendations which fall to be implemented by a range of Departments and offices. I will confine my remarks to those recommendations which fall within my Department's direct responsibility.</P>
      <P>On 26 October 2000, in reply to a question by Deputy Howlin, I gave a detailed response on the various recommendations contained in the first report. Given time constraints, I do not propose to go over this ground again. Instead, I will outline the position with the various recommendations made in the sub-committee's final report which was published on 3 April 2001.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that work on considering and implementing these recommendations has been given a high priority in my Department. Within the time allotted to me it is not possible to give a detailed response on the various recommendations for which I am responsible. In all, as a result of the sub-committee's recommendations, five separate pieces of legislation are in various stages of preparation. In some cases, a wide ranging process of consultation with interested parties has also been initiated as part of the legislative drafting process. Steps are also being put in hand in regard to the further studies recommended by the sub-committee. The various resourcing issues have also been attended to in consultation with the relevant parties.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should mention that my Department is finalising a report to the Committee of Public Accounts which will detail the progress made on implementing all the recommendations made in the final report for which my Department has direct responsibility. This report should be ready for submission to the committee in the near future.</P>

      <P>The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector recommended that a new scheme of performance-related awards, based on 10% of the payroll for the group, should be introduced for secretaries general, deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries in the Civil Service. It was also recommended that, when the necessary conditions are in place, schemes of performance-related awards should be introduced for the commissioner, deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner ranks in the Garda Síochána and <Col N="511" /> for top posts in local authorities and health boards. As regards non-commercial state-sponsored bodies, the review body recommended that the extension of schemes to the chief executives of these bodies, where they are not already in operation, should be considered by the parent Departments in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that performance-related awards should not be introduced for secretaries general or for the Garda Commissioner because of the nature of the working relationship between people at this level and Ministers. However, the recommendations of the review body in relation to the other groups have been accepted. The Government also decided that an awards scheme should be applied to the ranks of brigadier general and major general in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The new scheme for deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries, and other posts at equivalent levels, in the Civil Service is being introduced from 1 January 2002. The new scheme will replace an existing scheme, based on 4% of the payroll, which applies to assistant secretaries. My Department will consult other relevant Departments about the introduction of awards schemes in the areas outside the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I have also established the Committee for Performance Awards which was recommended by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector to oversee the new scheme of performance related awards for deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries in the Civil Service and certain other posts.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1998 they obtained details of 430 cases of investments made under the National Irish Bank &ndash; CMI schemes. To date, 296 of these cases have been settled and 134 are still under investigation. Eleven cases are under investigation for possible prosecution through the courts.</P>
      <P>Revenue has collected £25.7 million, 32.63 million, in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases. This is made up of £19.03 million, 24.16 million, in settled cases and £6.67 million, 8.47 million, in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> Following a further review of their records by National Irish Bank, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by Revenue in April 2001. Of these, 15 cases involve very small sums and are unlikely to involve significant tax. All the additional cases will be investigated as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the bank has paid compensation to some investors. Revenue has discussed the question of tax liability on the payments with the bank. The Revenue view is that these payments would attract capital gains tax liability and arrangements are being made to collect the tax arising.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the interview to which he refers was a wide ranging one, covering the whole spectrum of national and international economic developments. When questioned on the issue of the implications of the budgetary arithmetic for the NDP, I did not state that projects would be delayed.

In relation to infrastructure, the economic and social infrastructure programme of the NDP, which sets down in current prices the indicative allocation of resources for each of the seven years of the plan, provided for total Exchequer and EU investment of 7.95 billion for the period 2000 to 2002. Based on the recently published abridged Estimates and the latest estimated outturns for 2000 and 2001 there will be a total Exchequer investment of some 8 billion over the first three years of the plan in the infrastructure programme, which is fully in line with that promised in the published operational programme.</P>

I also stated that I was looking forward to receiving the board's recommendation following completion of the negotiations. I am still awaiting this recommendation. Meanwhile, contract negotiations are ongoing between the two banks and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way on these negotiations until such time as they are completed and I have received the recommendation from the board.</P>
      <P>The terms of an ESOP have been recommended to me by the board of the bank and an information process is in train between management and staff.

      <P>If the board's recommendation in relation to the potential sale to Rabobank is acceptable, I will take the matter to Government and, in due course, under section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 2001, I will seek a motion of approval from the House before proceeding with the sale of my shares in the bank. As previously stated, details of the board's recommendation will then be given to each member of the House, prior to the date of the motion, to allow Deputies reach a fully informed view.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank has informed me that, to date, the accounts of about half a dozen persons have been frozen by the financial institutions and that the total amount involved is somewhat less than £100,000. These accounts have been frozen by the financial institutions on the basis of Council Regulation EC No. 467/2001 of 6 March 2001 which,<i> inter alia</i>, freezes funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan. It is directly applicable in Ireland and therefore has the force of law here. This regulation, which has been amended by the EU Commission on three occasions since 11 September, lists the entities and individuals whose accounts must be targeted. There is an obligation on the financial institutions to ensure that these accounts are frozen and it is therefore not accurate to say that the accounts have been frozen by the Central Bank. However, the bank is one of the relevant competent authorities in this country for implementing the regulations and it has been maintaining close contacts with the institutions in the matter. I have also signed statutory instruments which provide for penalties for fund transfers which are in breach of the regulations.</P>

    <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the <Col N="516" /> new scheme of administering tax relief in respect of qualifying mortgage interest &ndash; tax relief at source. This is a major simplification measure that I announced in my Budget Statement in December 1999. The essence of this scheme is that, from 1 January 2002, tax relief on qualifying mortgage interest will no longer be administered through the personal tax system but will instead be given at source by the financial institutions, the mortgage lenders, which will then be recouped by Revenue.</P>
    <P>There are in the region of 477,000 taxpayers in receipt of tax relief for mortgage interest. To instruct the lending institutions to allow the tax relief at source, it is necessary to have full loan account details for each claimant. Earlier this year, Revenue undertook an extensive matching exercise with the lending institutions to match the loan account details with the appropriate name and address for each borrower.</P>
    <P>Full matches were achieved for 200,000 cases and Revenue wrote to these borrowers and advised them to verify the matched loan details and to contact Revenue only if there was an error. In the remaining cases, where a satisfactory match was not achieved or where there was some doubt, Revenue wrote to the borrowers concerned during June and July 2001 requesting loan account details. In the case of local authority mortgage holders, estimated at 70,000 accounts, who are currently claiming tax relief, a simplified scheme is being introduced from next January which does not require a form to be returned.</P>
    <P>To date, 87,000 forms have been returned. It is estimated that in the region of 120,000 claimants who should have returned the forms have not yet done so. Revenue has just completed a reminder notification to all those who have failed to respond to the initial letter with their loan details. This reminder notification is being supported by an extensive radio and press advertising campaign and is expected to result in the majority of outstanding forms being returned before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The majority of those currently entitled to the relief will receive it at source from 1 January next. Any claimants who are late in returning their loan account details to Revenue will still receive their full entitlements as soon as is practicable following receipt of such details by Revenue.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has been carrying out <Col N="517" /> detailed investigations since October 1999. The investigation has essentially two elements. There are Ansbacher-type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits. Revenue has indicated there are 185 Ansbacher type cases consisting of 121 cases named by the authorised officer and 64 similar cases discovered by Revenue. The investigation includes examining the tax position of identified entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connec<Col N="518" /> ted entities in relation to core cases under investigation is now more than 600.</P>
      <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available. To date a total of £12.33 million, 15.66 million, has been received as payments on account in 47 cases. This is made up of:</P>

    <P>The investigation into three cases has been concluded: one following clarification from the taxpayer and the other two cases were settled on payment of £200,000, 253,948, and £220,000, 279,342, respectively. Other than these, no cases have been settled and the other payments received represent payments on account. It is quite clear that the investigation is more extensive than earlier envisaged. Revenue has informed me that it is both time-consuming and complex and it is likely to continue for some time to come but that it is confident that the investigation will yield significant results.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received figures from the banks or financial institutions indicating the numbers of applications received for the special savings investment scheme; if, on the basis of such figures, his Department has an assessment of the likely cost to the Exchequer of the special savings investment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the monthly returns to date made by the qualifying savings managers under the new savings scheme, the total tax credits claimed by the institutions so far amount to some £43.5 million, 55.2 million, in respect of subscriptions of £173.8 million, 220.7 million. As I said recently when replying to a virtually identical parliamentary question, the number of special savings incentive accounts in operation will not be available until after 28 February 2002, when the first comprehensive annual returns giving details of individual accounts are furnished by the qualifying savings managers.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously in replying to parliamentary questions regarding,<i> inter alia</i>, the likely cost of the scheme, it is difficult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the special savings incentive scheme because of its very nature &ndash; it is new and innovative and the size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on take-up by participants in the scheme. When the question was being looked at prior to the publication of the 2001 Finance Bill provisions, my Department considered various ranges of costs based on different assumptions. As I said earlier in the year when answering a parliamentary question on this matter, a tentative estimate for a full-year cost was approximately £100 million, 127 million, and that in so far as the take-up turned out to be very strong, I said that this figure might have to be revised upward.</P>
      <P>Figures to date indicate that the cost to the Exchequer for the first six months of the scheme is some £43.5 million, 55.2 million. However, it is not possible to extrapolate reliably from these figures what the twelve-month cost to the Exchequer of the SSIA scheme will be. It is likely, however, that the £100 million, 127 million, figure that I have already referred to will be reached, taking into account that the latest monthly figure indicated a cost to the Exchequer of some £11 million, 14 million. If this level of tax credit claims were continued for the next six months, the total cost for the first 12 months of the scheme would be some £110 million, 140 million. To the extent that the number of claims increases further, the cost will also increase.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 61 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that over the years a number of economists have attempted to measure the shadow economy in various countries. This has proven extremely difficult and there is no measuring system that economists regard as definitive or even reliable. For this reason, the figures referred to in the question, which I understand are derived mechanically from calculations outlined in economic literature, merely give some guesstimate of potential scale.</P>
      <P>Tax evasion is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who work closely with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in combating shadow economy activity. In their statement of strategy, covering the three year period 2001-03, Revenue has undertaken to examine the feasibility of Revenue itself measuring the tax gap, that is the amount of potential taxation that is lost through evasion, including the shadow economy. The paper to be published following this examination may provide some much-needed information in this area.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they have a comprehensive range of strategies to combat the shadow economy and these are set out in their statement of strategy. They include, <i>inter alia</i>, increasing the resources that are devoted to compliance and audit programmes, making full use of computer-based information-matching facilities and increasing the number of prosecutions and convictions by establishing a special prosecutions division.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have embarked on a complete reorganisation of its operations at head office and at local level including, for example, a new large cases division, focusing on large customers and an operations policy and evaluation division which will advise on best practice and conduct research including on tax evasion. It is expected that some of the new divisions will come on stream early in the new year. The restructuring contains a number of elements designed to improve the handling of tax evasion.</P>

      <P>The OECD Economic Outlook No. 70 published on 21 November gives the OECD's views on the economic performance of the OECD area in general and of each member country.</P>
      <P>According to the outlook, output growth in real terms in the OECD area is expected to be 1% this year. Growth may pick up in the course of 2002 and may exceed 3% in 2003. This projection assumes a politically benign environment. World trade is expected to rebound strongly in the latter part of 2002, consistent with a recovery of spending on ICT goods and a strengthening pull from US imports from mid-2002 onwards.</P>
      <P>The section on the Irish economy included in the outlook projects real growth of 5.6% this year, slowing to 3.7% in 2002 before recovering to 6.4% in 2003. Exports and associated imports are likely to remain weak until well into 2002 when a pick-up in the world economy is projected. It also suggests that unemployment may reach 5.3% in 2002, but that wage growth and inflation should slow.</P>
      <P>The OECD identify a number of risks to its projections. A key risk is that wages will continue to grow rapidly. If, in addition, the euro were to appreciate, competitiveness might deteriorate significantly, which would reduce the impact of the global pick-up going into 2003 and, with the economy slowing, house prices could weaken, leading to reduced consumption and less buoyant household sentiment. The OECD advises that policy needs to focus on improving human capital and infrastructure but that moderate pay increases in the private sector will also be required to maintain competitiveness. It also advises that rising current expenditures need to be carefully monitored to ensure objectives are being achieved efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the OECD's overall analysis of the state of the Irish economy and with its advice regarding future policy requirements. The improvement of human capital and the provision <Col N="522" /> of infrastructure are key priorities of Government policy. I also agree with the OECD's view regarding the need for these policies to be supported by moderate pay increases to maintain competitiveness.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that while the OECD forecast slower economic growth next year for Ireland than what we have achieved in recent times, it still sees Ireland growing more rapidly than virtually all other OECD member states through 2002. It foresees a renewal of strong economic growth into 2003 as the world economy picks up. It also confirms the view that Irish inflation should continue to ease over the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I will publish our own estimate for growth on budget day.</P>

    <P>IDA Ireland fully recognises and is committed to ensuring the process of balanced regional dispersal is achieved in the west. Construction of a new 27,800 sq ft advance unit on a new 35-acre busi<Col N="524" /> ness park in Ballinasloe is now completed and will be shortly occupied by Valois SA. The IDA is working with Gort Chamber of Commerce regarding the development of a 20,000 sq ft advance factory under the IDA BES scheme. The factory premises will be completed by end of December 2001. The IDA has acquired 27 acres of land in Tuam and planning permission for site development has been received. A contractor has been appointed to commence site development works in November 2001. Following on from this, IDA will seek developers to provide advance buildings on the site in the course of the 2002. A new 20 acre office park is under development at Parkmore East outside Galway city and construction is complete on a new 25,500 sq ft high quality office building on this park. TerraNua, Fidelity, currently based in the IFSC has committed to a full floor in this building with a plan to employ 100 people in a software development activity in Galway; this project has now commenced. A new 25,000 sq ft industrial unit is proposed for Parkmore West in Galway City.</P>

      <P>Approximately a year ago Valois, a French company that makes dispensary systems for the perfumery and cosmetic industry, was due to set up in Galway with approximately 80 jobs to be created over five years. The company has been in temporary accommodation in the old AT Cross factory in Ballinasloe. Valois now has a reservation in the new 27,000 sq. ft. advance factory in the IDA industrial estate in the town. Valois is in negotiation with the developer in relation to carrying out some modifications of the building. I understand the company aims to be in the building at the end of the year and will start production as soon as it is settled. Valois employ 1,700 people worldwide. Early next year IDA Ireland will put in place plans for the next phase of the development of the Ballinasloe industrial estate.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the media reports supplied and in my reply to Question No. 28645/01, on 20 November 2001, I addressed many of the issues raised including the steps taken to heighten awareness among immigrant workers of their rights and entitlements under our labour legislation. Two points stand out. One is that the statutory rights and entitlements of all who work in Ireland will be assured, irrespective of nationality, and that effective mechanisms are in place by which all workers can vindicate their legal rights. This applies equally to the provision of information on statutory employment rights and protections and to the enforcement of such rights in the workplace. The labour inspectorate generally applies a focus on those sectors of the economy where workers attract the lower rates of pay and may be most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The second point relates to certain practices which although not permitted under Irish recruitment legislation occur outside our jurisdiction. These matters are not within our control. However, where non-compliance with labour legislation is reported, and subsequent investigation by my inspectors finds evidence to confirm such reports, I can give an assurance that the infringements will be followed up as appropriate so that the rights or entitlements that have been denied or withheld are fully restored or otherwise honoured. Such follow up may also, where adequate evidence to satisfy our courts can be obtained, include the possibility of prosecution.</P>

      <P>One of the repercussions of the <Col N="526" /> United States terrorist attacks has been the decision of insurance underwriters to withdraw cover for war and terrorist risks from airlines, airports and other essential aviation suppliers. The Government, in common with the action by other EU member states, and governments worldwide, stepped in to bridge the gap in insurance cover, which was no longer available. I introduced a Bill to give effect to this in the House on 23 November.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Transport Council, at its meeting on 16 October 2001, approved the payment by member states of aid to airlines whose operations were directly affected by the four day closure of US airspace. On 1 November last, a letter issued from my Department to all Irish licensed airlines setting out the criteria for such aid and inviting submissions from affected airlines. To date, two claims have been received and a further claim is expected.</P>

      <P>Provision of broadband and telecommunications services is, in the first instance, the role of the private sector. I introduced support to private rollout of broadband services in 1999 with an allocation of 26 million &ndash; £21 million. This supported 13 separate projects aimed at rolling out broadband. Most of these projects are complete or nearing completion and are subject to technical and financial audit. In certain cases, where construction is complete, companies are beginning to offer services. It is my intention to make available all technical details concerning these projects early next year when the construction period is complete.</P>
      <P>One of these projects involved hybrid fibre co-axial cable upgrades and digital MMDS upgrades in Clonmel and Kilkenny, to be carried out by Suir Nore Relays, now Chorus. The total grant allocated to this project is 2 million &ndash; £1.6 million. Technical reviews of this project indicate that most physical infrastructure is in place, telephone customers are availing of services and data services are being tested. Chorus has been paid 20% of the total grant. Final payments will be made and performance bonds released upon final project completion and offerings of data service.</P>

      <P>However, farmers who are unable to meet the minimum stocking density but who qualified for headage grants in 2000 in respect of cattle and-or sheep may qualify for payment under the new scheme, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</P>
      <P>Livestock units, LUs, are calculated as follows. Bovines over two years of age equal one LU; bovines two years old and under equal 0.6 LU; registered breeding mares registered in the Irish horse register or with the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society equal 1 LU; female breeding deer equal 0.3 LU; and sheep and goats equal 0.15 LU.</P>
      <P>An applicant under the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme who has non-registered horses only is not eligible for area-based payments.</P>

      <Quest>if it is possible to identify from his Department's integrated information systems the percentage of farmers who have persistent difficulties with applications for area aid, headage, and premium payments; if he will consider a special help or advisory initiative to eliminate or minimise payment loss to the farmers in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Following from the 1992 CAP reform the most persistent difficulty encountered by farmers in completing application forms for the various headage and premium schemes was the incorrect transcription of cattle ear-tag numbers. Such tag numbers were invariably rejected following validation against my Department's computerised database, resulting query letters having to be issued to a large number of farmers seeking the correct tag number. That difficulty has been largely eliminated following the very substantial simplification <Col N="531" /> of the application forms over the past couple of years. The introduction of printed cattle identification documents or &ldquo;passports&rdquo; and the use of associated bar coding has facilitated a major simplification of the application forms for the special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, farmers are being paid their entitlements under the new slaughter premium scheme without the need for any application. Payments are being made using information held on the Department's computerised database, CMMS. The whole application process has been further simplified this year by the introduction of the new area-based compensatory allowance scheme which replaces five animal based schemes under the old animal headage regime.</P>
      <P>When new schemes are launched representatives from my Department meet with representatives from Teagasc to brief them on details of the schemes. My Department and Teagasc also arrange public meetings to brief farmers and others who have an interest in the schemes. Where necessary my Department produces booklets on new schemes for the assistance of all interested parties. Help sheets are also issued with the individual application forms which are preprinted with the farmer's name and address and herd number. In addition, staff in the local offices of my Department provide information and help where necessary. I am satisfied that through the progressive use of information technology the application processes for these schemes have been substantially simplified and that the help and advisory initiatives in place are adequate.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission's proposal to replace the existing variable ewe premium with a fixed premium of 21 per head was rejected by the Council at the meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers last week. The final presidency compromise provided for the basic premium of 21 per head to be supplemented by the equivalent of 1 per head in the form of a national envelope. However, this compromise was rejected by some member states, including Ireland, as being insufficient and by others because it was too generous and too costly. There were also a number of other member states who had indicated that they would vote against any further increase in the sheep meat budget which, if the presidency compromise had been adopted, would have been fixed at approximately 1.9 billion per annum. This outcome demonstrates fairly starkly the difficulties in securing any improvement when the negotiations resume next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> I made a strong case in the negotiations for the premium to be fixed at a level that ensures that sheep meat remains a viable farm enterprise. I also sought the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep in order to redress the unequal treatment of sheep producers within the cattle extensification system. The current climate is not the most opportune for negotiating a reform of the sheep meat regime. Many member states who are not significant producers of sheep meat are extremely concerned about the budgetary situation and the need to comply with the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin in 1999. The negotiations are also taking place in a context where current sheep prices in Ireland are on average 40% higher than last year and the ewe premium this year is likely to be below 10. While the current price levels are the product of a particular situation &ndash; and there is no guarantee that these price levels will continue into the future &ndash; they are a significant factor in current negotiations. I intend to continue to work for a more satisfactory outcome at the next meeting of the council in December.</P>

      <P>Following processing of the area aid application for 2001 of the person named, an over-claim on one of his land parcels was determined. This over-claim has arisen over the past few years and each year including the current 2001 area aid year a map of the land parcel in question was sent to the person named. The person named, who has returned the map, has claimed that the land contained in this land parcel is 7.82 hectares. The map has been digitised and the area has been determined at 4.99 hectares. In order to resolve this recurring issue, this application has been sent for ground inspection. No payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme will issue to the person named until the results of the area aid inspection have been finalised.</P>
      <P>The reason the person named was not paid extensification premium for the year 2000 at the time when most farmers were paid in May and June was that he failed to return a herd reconciliation form showing the animals in his herd at the end of the year 2000. The form was required for the establishment of an accurate cattle movement monitoring system database which all member states are obliged to have in place under EU regulations. The necessary form has now been returned and payment of 2000 extensification premium will be made shortly.</P>

    <P>Commonage framework plans are currently being prepared and when finalised, subject to individual agri-environmental plans, the maximum number of sheep that can be maintained by individual farmers on their farms as a whole and on their commonage land will be established. It is expected that all framework <Col N="534" /> plans will be completed early in 2002 but in the meantime, sheep numbers may not be increased on farms that include commonage land. This restriction applies to all farms with commonage land including those where the farmer is participating in the rural environment protection scheme and regardless of whether his existing REPS plan allows more sheep to be maintained than his present number. As the farm of the person named includes commonage land, he cannot receive an allocation of ewe premium quota from the 2002 national reserve nor may he purchase or lease additional quota for 2002.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he had discussions with the Central Bank regarding the reserves of the bank; his estimate of the level of free reserves or other reserves at the Central Bank; the purpose of these reserves as Ireland is a part of the euro zone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Central Bank that the level of its accounting reserves at the end of September stood at 1,450 million. As with any balance sheet, the Central Bank's total assets have a counterpart in liabilities. The liabilities side includes deposits, by credit institutions and government, legal tender notes and the bank's capital. It also contains a revaluation account, which acts in part as a buffer against exchange rate movements and the bank's accounting reserves. The latter consist of the superannuation, currency and general reserves and have been accumulated by the bank over the years from income earned from its operations.</P>
      <P>These accounting reserves must be distinguished from the so-called official external reserves. The latter represent the bank's external holdings, principally of deposits or instruments denominated in foreign currency and amount to over 6 billion. It must be remembered that the bank also has considerable liabilities that must be set against these assets, and the external reserves are not, therefore, free assets which could be liquidated and handed over for some other purpose. The suggestion sometimes made, therefore, that this 6 billion can somehow be regarded as unencumbered, and available for other purposes, is therefore unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore the bank's accounting reserves which most accurately reflect its net position. The bank's balance sheet must, at any given time, be sufficiently strong to underpin its credibility as a major financial institution, with minimal credit risk for the many financial institutions which act <Col N="535" /> as counterparty to its monetary policy and foreign exchange rate operations. This requires that the bank should also have sufficient reserves to meet any adverse market developments or other contingencies which might result in losses for the bank. As a participant member of the European system of central banks, the strength of the Central Bank's balance sheet must also contribute to the overall financial strength and stability of the euro system.</P>
    <P>An event such as the changeover to the euro, which is having such a large effect on the financial system, and the culmination of which will be seen at the very beginning of next year in the actual changeover to euro notes and coins, naturally gives rise to some consideration of the role and purpose of the Central Bank and its balance sheet. The role of the bank in relation to monetary and exchange rate matters have, of course, been largely determined already, having regard to the various applicable Treaty provisions, and the changes in domestic legislation required by those.</P>
    <P>As regards the balance sheet issue, I have taken the opportunity recently to invite the board of the Central Bank to consider whether a portion of its accounting reserves might be made available to the State. In its reply, the board indicated to me that when the changeover to the euro is completed, it will be conducting a review of the level of accounting reserves. I will be examining the results of this review when they become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the National Treasury Management Agency, in its capacity as manager of the national pensions reserve fund, that the current balance in the Fund is 7,687 million (£6,054 million). This is constituted of 4,528 million (£3,566 million) proceeds of the sale of the former Telecom Éireann, 1,629 million (£1,283 million) of GNP related Exchequer contributions for 1999 and 2000, and 358 million (£282 million) interest which accrued to the temporary holding fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On establishment of the national pensions reserve fund on 2 April 2001, this total balance of 6,515 million (£5,131 million) was transferred to that fund. Since then another 972 million (£765 million) has been paid into the fund, representing this year's 1% GNP exchequer payment, and a further 200 million (£158 million) interest has been earned. This gives a total of 7,129 million <Col N="536" /> (£5,615 million) principal contributions and 558 million (£439 million) interest, bringing the fund balance up to 7,687 million (£6,054 million) as I indicated.</P>
    <P>As regards the Eircom sale, the following provides a breakdown of the moneys received. In July, 1999, the State held an initial public offering or IPO of its shareholding in Eircom. Just over 1.7 billion shares were disposed of through that IPO, an allocation to the ESOP and the exercise of an option to acquire an additional 15% by Comsource (the vehicle used by the strategic partners KPN and Telia). Receipts amounting to some 6,156 million (£4,848 million) were lodged to the Exchequer in 1999 and 2000. Of this amount 4,210 million (£3,316 million) refers directly to the IPO. The retail-institutional split was 55% retail, 45% institutional, yielding proceeds of 2,316 million (£1,824 million) from the retail offer and proceeds of 1,894 million (£1,492 million) from the institutional offer respectively. Of these receipts of 6,156 million (£4,848 million), a total of 4,528 million (£3,566 million) was paid into the pension reserve fund via the temporary holding fund and 1,587 million (£1,250 million) was used to discharge the Exchequer liability in respect of pension entitlements of Eircom and An Post employees. The residual amount, 41 million (£32 million), accrued to the Exchequer surplus in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the designation of areas under the urban, town and rural renewal schemes. The designation of areas under both the urban renewal scheme and the town renewal scheme is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The 1999 urban renewal scheme made provision for the operation of a more planned, integrated and focused approach to tax incentive-based urban regeneration. A significant feature of the urban renewal scheme was the enhanced role of local authorities in selecting sites for possible tax incentive designation, although the final decision regarding the designation of areas and the granting of incentives was made by the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Finance. In the selection of sites, local authorities were assisted by detailed guidelines which set out the purposes and aims of the scheme, the criteria to be used in selecting areas, and advice on the approach to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Integrated area plan proposals prepared and submitted by local authorities were subjected to detailed assessment by an expert advisory panel. Recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and designations were implemented on that basis. The panel selected 49 integrated area plans for designation under the urban renewal scheme. The areas selected were announced by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, in February 1999 and the residential elements of the scheme were introduced with effect from 1 March 1999. Due to a delay in securing European Commission approval, the introduction of the business elements of the scheme was delayed until 1 July 1999. The scheme is due to terminate on 31 December 2002.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of the town renewal scheme is to restore, consolidate and improve the existing built fabric of towns, to promote sensitive development where appropriate and to revitalise the centres of small towns. When preparing and assessing town renewal plans, local authorities and the expert panel were obliged to consider the aims and objectives of the scheme and the specific criteria by which plans should be assessed. In accordance with the Town Renewal Act, 2000, and 1999 town renewal guidelines, the designation of sites was decided in the context of town renewal plans. Each local authority had to prepare and submit plans, including proposals for the designation of specific sites for tax incentives, in accordance with the appropriate criteria as outlined in the guidelines. The expert panel on town renewal assessed the plans submitted and made recommendations on the sites designated in the context of the plans submitted by the various local authorities. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations were implemented.</P>
    <P>The panel recommended 100 towns for designation for tax relief under the town renewal scheme. The residential elements of the scheme were introduced with effect from 1 April 2000. Agreement was reached with the European Commission in March 2001 to enable almost all projects under the scheme to proceed with effect from 6 April 2001. Discussions are continuing to secure agreement to enable the outstanding element of the scheme to proceed. The termination date for this scheme is 31 December 2003.</P>
    <P>The designation of areas in the upper Shannon area for tax relief under the rural renewal scheme was provided for in the 1998 Finance Act. The areas designated included all of counties Longford and Leitrim and parts of counties Roscommon, Cavan and Sligo. The area designated under this scheme was the largest contiguous area in the State that was continuing to undergo population decline. The 1996 census showed that the populations of both counties Longford and Leitrim had declined while every other county in the State had shown moderate or significant increases. The objectives for this scheme are to <Col N="541" /> assist in the reversal of population decline and also to stimulate economic activity in the area.</P>
    <P>The relief for rented residential property available under the scheme was introduced with effect from 1 June 1998 and relief for owner occupiers of residential property was subsequently provided for in the 1999 Finance Act and introduced with effect from 6 April 1999. The introduction of the capital allowances for commercial and industrial property was delayed until 1 July 1999 as these reliefs were not cleared by the European Commission until late June 1999. In view of the delay in securing approval of the non-residential elements of the scheme the original deadline of 31 December 2001 was extended by one year to 31 December 2002.</P>

      <P>Ireland remains an attractive location for mobile foreign direct investment (FDI), with the factors which have underpinned significant inflows over the last number of years remaining in place. These include a young, flexible and well educated workforce, participation in EMU, access to the EU market and a pro-business environment, both generally and in terms of corporation tax and grant regimes. The slowdown in the global economy which is currently under way may result in some moderation in FDI flows internationally. In these circumstances, it is important that the economy remains competitive in order to be in a posi<Col N="542" /> tion to secure further significant FDI inflows when the global economy picks up.</P>

      <P>The assignment of the NET debt to the Minister for Finance this year served to increase the debt by about 241 million (£190 million) from its level at the end of 2000 of 36.511 million (£28.755 million). Over the course of the year, foreign exchange movements and discounts and premia on debt issuance and cancellation have reduced the debt by 16 million (£12.6 million). The remainder of the change in the national debt between the end of 2000 and the end of 2001 will be principally dependent on the 2001 Exchequer balance. Changes in the national debt in 2002 will likewise primarily be attributable to the 2002 Exchequer balance. The White Paper on receipts and expenditure for 2002 will be published on Saturday 1 December, and will contain a revised forecast of the Exchequer balance for 2001, as well as a projection for 2002.</P>
      <P>A more meaningful comparator of sovereign indebtedness, however, is the general Government debt to GDP ratio. Most recent published figures show that at the end of 2000, this ratio stood at 38.6%, the second lowest in the EU. The projection for 2001, which was prepared in August, forecast a further reduction to 34.2%. In the light of economic developments since then, this figure will be revised upward. The revised figure will be published with the budget.</P>

      <Col N="543" /> Progress in each operational programme is monitored by a monitoring committee comprised of representatives of the Departments which implement the programme measures, the Department of Finance, the four social partners pillars, the regional assemblies and the European Commission. The monitoring committee is chaired by the managing authorities, which provide secretarial support. There is also a separate monitoring committee for the national development plan and community support framework for Ireland, 2000-2006, chaired by the Department of Finance, which monitors progress across all operational programmes. A Cabinet committee on infrastructure and public private partnerships, chaired by the Taoiseach, has been established to monitor the progress on the implementation of the NDP infrastructure programme. It is assisted in its work by a cross-departmental team of senior officials.</P>
    <P>Apart from the elaborate formal monitoring arrangements referred to above, there is ongoing contact between Departments and implementing agencies regarding the implementation of the plan. Over a seven year plan of the scale and ambition of the NDP, projects and programmes may, for various reasons, proceed at a different pace than originally foreseen. I am generally satisfied with the progress to date, especially in the key area of infrastructure. Progress will continue to be the subject of ongoing monitoring and there will be a comprehensive mid-term review of the progress of the plan in 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations for the changeover to the euro are well advanced. While it would not be realistic to expect such an operation to be completed entirely without difficulty, I am confident that the changeover will proceed reasonably smoothly between 1 January and the end of the dual circulation period at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002. Appropriate contingency planning is nevertheless proceeding, within the context of the extensive preparations already made and being made. The changeover to the euro involves preparation of legislation, production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector and by businesses, consumer matters and the provision of widescale public <Col N="544" /> information. Substantial preparations have been made under each of these headings.</P>
    <P>A great deal of legislation dealing with the euro has been put in place. The Euro Changeover (Amounts) Act, 2001, provides for the substitution, with effect from 1 January 2002, of convenient euro amounts for Irish pound amounts at specific references in listed Acts and statutory instruments. Together with the Finance Act, 2001, the Social Welfare Act, 2001, and other relevant legislation, it will provide for a framework of convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002, in the principal areas of law under which citizens transact business with the State. In all cases of changes to convenient amounts under this legislation, the principle of favouring the citizen has been followed. Irish pound amounts in law that are not affected by the Act will be converted to euro on 1 January 2002 at the conversion rate, under Council Regulation (EC) No. 974/98.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Central Bank that euro note and coin production is on target, and that the frontloading of euro cash is progressing satisfactorily. Each Government Department is responsible for its euro preparations and those of the bodies under its aegis. Their progress on preparations is monitored by my Department and their reports confirm that these preparations continue to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Business preparations are primarily a matter for businesses themselves. However, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has been providing extensive information in various ways for companies preparing for the changeover and is continuing to do so. Also, in view of the role of retailers in the changeover, Forfás has taken many initiatives to help retailers, including the distribution of a specific guide earlier in the year and production of a training kit which has been sent to all retailers. Forfás has also been working closely with FÁS, which has been providing training for retailers and sales assistants around the country. Finally, Forfás will from this week be sending another information pack to retailers, stressing the key final messages.</P>
    <P>Consumer matters are for my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs and for the Director of Consumer Affairs. The national code of practice on the euro changeover was relaunched in December 2000, along with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover and this plan is being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has carried out extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included sending a leaflet to every household in 1998, 1999, 2000 and again this year, widespread circulation of posters and leaflets, provision of a website and lo-call inquiry line, distribution of information packs to schools and of guidelines to every teacher and the making available of almost 5000 packs aimed at training trainers. National television, radio and press campaigns commenced <Col N="545" /> in late 2000. The needs of low-awareness and special needs groups are addressed through the board's consultative panel, and many of the projects in the board's programme of part-funding for non-Governmental organisations involve carrying out euro information activities for these groups.</P>
    <P>In October, the board arranged for the distribution to households of a handbook on the changeover to the euro, while An Post is currently delivering an electronic converter to households, with distribution scheduled for completion by 10 December. These initiatives will build on the substantial levels of awareness already achieved. Advertising on the euro will continue, while leaflets will be made widely available to advise the public how we can help the changeover to run smoothly, as set out in the euro handbook. Finally, starter packs of euro coins will be put on sale from mid-December to enable people to familiarise themselves with the new coins in advance of 1 January, as well as helping to facilitate the changeover from that date.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the case referred to by the Deputy relates largely to income tax dating back to 1992. The taxpayer in question received numerous requests and demands for payment. When, in 2001, some liability for 1992 still remained unpaid, Revenue referred the tax due and appropriate interest to the sheriff for collection.</P>
      <P>Interest is a statutory charge and is designed to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue and to ensure equity for those taxpayers who pay the correct amount on time. It is the age of the debt which determines the amount of interest chargeable and, as indicated above, the debt in this case dates back to 1992. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that having regard to the age of the debt and the taxpayer's circumstances, they are not prepared to refund the interest collected.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment administered by the health boards which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
      <P>Eligible people who do not benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme may avail of a mobility allowance up to a maximum of £90 &ndash; 114.28 &ndash; per month. Eligible people who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme may avail of a mobility allowance up to a maximum of £45.60 &ndash; 57.90 &ndash; per month.</P>
      <P>Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. The threshold income used in determining eligibility is the disability allowance rate. If the income of the applicant does not exceed the current rate of disability allowance, the applicant will qualify for the appropriate full rate of the mobility allowance. Where the applicant's income exceeds the current rate of disability allowance, the rate of the mobility allowance is reduced accordingly. For those applicants on disability allowance, invalidity pension or infectious diseases maintenance allowance, income earned up to a maximum of £75 &ndash; 95.23 &ndash; per week of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature, can be disregarded for the purpose of assessing mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>The motorised transport grant is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. The purpose of this grant is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. The maximum grant payable to eligible people is £3,300 &ndash; 4,190.14. The guidelines for assessment used are reviewed by the health boards on an annual basis and reflect the average weekly industrial earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment is based on the income of the applicant and spouse, if any, together with any <Col N="547" /> income derived from investment, letting, etc. This is reduced by the following outgoings: allowances for rent, mortgage interest repayments, exceptional needs or expenses exceeding £5 &ndash; 6.35 &ndash; per week; allowances as permissible under the income tax code, i.e. applicant £1,000 &ndash; 1269.74 &ndash; PAYE allowance &ndash; first grant only &ndash; and £4,200 &ndash; 5332.90 &ndash; for dependent spouse.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Additional funding allocated to the health boards for the development of such services will be in the context of the total amount of funding allocated for the development of services in the physical and sensory disability sector. Other priorities for service developments in the sector will also be taken into consideration when allocating this funding.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, just more than £107 million &ndash; 135.86 million &ndash; has been allocated by this Government for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year I allocated an additional £12 million &ndash; 15.237 million, rising to £24 million &ndash; 30.474 million &ndash; in the year 2002, for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. I decided that, of this, £5 million &ndash; 46.349 million rising to £10 million &ndash; 12.697 million in the year 2002 will be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million &ndash; 3.174 million with a full year cost of £6 million &ndash; 7.618 million for personal assistance services. This means that over 2001-02, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million &ndash; 13.332 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million &ndash; 26.03 million ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. I assure the Deputy that providing the relevant support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible will remain one of my priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System For You, launched by the Government earlier this week. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>

      <P>I would like to refute the Deputy's suggestion that there has been a reduction in the allocation of funding to the North-Western Health Board in respect of the provision of additional beds at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. On foot of that review, the Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System For You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department has been in discussion in recent months with the North-Western Health Board with a view to identifying potential to increase the number of acute hospital beds in the region. The board submitted a proposal to increase the bed complement at Sligo General Hospital by 30 beds. On foot of this submission I was pleased to provide additional funding of £375,000 to the North-Western Health Board to increase the capacity of the acute hospital system in the region in the current year to respond to identified service pressures.</P>
      <P>The additional level of funding required for this initiative in 2002 will be determined in discussion with the board and on foot of decisions in relation to next years Estimates provision.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90-114.28, £120-152.37, £150-190.46, in accordance with the three levels of dependency of medium, high and maximum which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, under Article 9 of the Second Schedule to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, a health board shall disregard the first £6,000 or 7,618.43 of any asset or assets owned or enjoyed by the applicant.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases.

      <P>An Bord Pleanála is a statutory independent body established to determine planning appeals and certain other matters. The board is required to keep itself informed of policies and objectives of a number of bodies, including planning authorities, and in reaching decisions on planning appeals it must also have regard to the provisions of the relevant local authority development plan. I am satisfied these provisions are adequate to ensure that local policies are fully considered by the board and I have no proposals to establish regional appeals boards.</P>
      <P>My Department and the board have been addressing, on an ongoing basis, a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously in the context of the backlog of appeals and the functions transferred to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I have approved significant additional staffing and financial resources for the board. It recently engaged 47 additional planners to work on a fee per case basis. It has also engaged seven private planning consultancy firms to report on 600 cases over a 12 month period. In addition, last week I appointed three new members to the board. This means the number of board members will increase to 12 from the beginning of 2002. It is anticipated that all these measures will enable the board to eliminate the backlog of appeal cases by mid 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment status of share fishermen for social insurance purposes has been considered by the High Court, hearing two appeals on a question of law under section 271 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1993 against a determination of the chief appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office. A judgment in this matter was delivered on 2 October last. The High Court held that share fishermen who offer their services to boat owners and skippers in the manner which is customary in the industry do so as self-employed co-venturers or partners with boat owners or skippers and are not employed under a contract of service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, share fishermen engaged in the customary manner are insurable under class S as self-employed persons. However, they may enhance their PRSI cover by availing of an optional scheme of social insurance &ndash; class P &ndash; which was introduced in 1994.</P>
      <P>This scheme gives share fishermen the option, on the payment of an additional contribution, of enhancing their social insurance cover over and above that available to other self employed persons. Payment of the additional contribution provides limited cover for disability benefit and unemployment benefit as well as full cover for treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>My Department will give detailed consideration to the decision of the High Court in this matter. When this process is completed I will bring forward such proposals as are deemed necessary in the context of the social insurance needs of those who are engaged in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the free schemes are available to people aged 66 or over, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefit providing both <Col N="558" /> income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
    <P>The many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, have been examined using the above objectives as the criteria for decision. In this regard, it is noted that people under age 66 years, including those in receipt of pre-retirement allowance, may experience social exclusion but they are not necessarily groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities. Accordingly, they would not be regarded as an appropriate group for free schemes eligibility.</P>
    <P>However, the current arrangements for the free schemes will be kept under review in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>One of the principal conditions for receipt of carer's allowance is that full-time care and attention is required and being provided to the care recipient.</P>
      <P>As part of a review of her entitlement, the person concerned was requested to provide medical evidence with regard to the care recipient. Having considered all the medical evidence available the Department's chief medical adviser expressed the opinion that the care recipient is not so invalided or disabled as to require full-time care and attention. On this basis carer's allowance payment was disallowed as this condition was no longer satisfied.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has appealed this decision and the appeals office will be in direct contact with her in due course regarding the outcome.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, a total of £12 million has been allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part <Col N="561" /> of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following ten locations: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Clonmel was received by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application for Clonmel is currently being considered in the context of the Garda CCTV expansion programme as referred to above.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the advisory committee has not received any application for Garda CCTV systems in Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town or Cashel. All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances/needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system to that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.  </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the location of law centres. I am informed that the Legal Aid Board has no plans to open a part-time law centre in Listowel at the present time. The board will, however, keep this matter under review in the context of demand for legal services and available resources.</P>

The investigation of these crimes is undertaken by divisional and district officers, and all the necessary technical services are available to these investigations. The national units, such as the Garda national bureau of criminal investigation and the national drugs unit are available to assist where necessary.

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency &ndash; RIA &ndash; is responsible,<i> inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. Under the system, the agency provides full board accommodation to asylum seekers in a number of settings including hostels, guesthouses and former hotels while their claims for refugee status are being determined. In this connection, in accordance with Government policy, the RIA conducts assessments of properties offered by persons in all areas of the State on an ongoing basis. However, a large number of such properties are found to be unsuitable.</P>

    <P>The RIA currently has a portfolio of 77 accommodation centres and nine reception centres located across 25 counties.</P>
    <P>The RIA has entered into a short-term memorandum of agreement with the proprietor of the Glenvera Hotel, Wellington Road, Cork city, for the provision of full board accommodation and ancillary services for up to 100 asylum seekers, mainly couples. Under the terms of the memorandum of agreement, the proprietor must ensure that the premises complies and operates in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of the local authority and other agencies in relation to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety.</P>
    <P>The proprietor of the hotel is also required to monitor its operation on an ongoing basis so as to minimise any impact on the local community. In accordance with normal practice, in bringing the hotel on stream, the RIA will adopt a sensitive approach to making placements and numbers will be built up on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the proprietor of the Glenvera Hotel also provides similar accommodation at Ashbourne House Hotel, Glounthaune, and An Poc Fada, Cobh, both of which the agency has determined, on foot of regular unannounced inspections by its inspectorate, to be operating satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed swimming pool in Tuam, Galway County Council submitted a preliminary report to my Department last December in respect of a replacement pool proposal. My Department has received a technical assessment from the Office of Public Works in connection with this preliminary report and sought additional documentation from Galway County Council in relation to some elements of the project. While some of this additional documentation has been received, and is being assessed by Office of Public Works, at present my Department is awaiting clarification on other issues which have been raised with the local authority. Further consideration will be given to the proposal when all outstanding issues have been finalised.</P>
      <P>Grants of up to £3 million are available under the swimming pool programme towards the provision of new or replacement pools, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
      <P>Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. Grants are allocated when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. I can assure her that every effort is being made to ensure that the children in question obtain appropriate school placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School attendance is currently governed by the School Attendance Act, 1926. Under the Act, responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance rests with the school attendance committees in Dublin city, Cork city, Waterford city and the County Borough of Dún Laoghaire-Blackrock, and with the Garda for the remainder of the country, including the Rathfarnham area. It is open to the enforcement authorities to prosecute parents or guardians of children under the terms of the Act where it is considered that either the level of attendance at a recognised school or the education received by other means is not satisfactory. In such cases, the onus of proof under the terms of section 18(2) of the Act rests <Col N="568" /> on the person being prosecuted and the court decides the issue.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about school attendance. For this reason, I have initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of school non-attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted Education Welfare Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Education Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. The National Education Welfare Board has been established on an interim basis and I have recently given approval for the recruitment of a chief executive officer. The number of educational welfare officers required for the implementation of the Act will be determined by the board as part of its preparations for the full implementation of the Act. The service will be implemented on a phased basis, in line with a plan to be developed by the board. It is my intention that the new National Education Welfare Board will, ultimately, cover the entire country.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Eligibility under the initiative is subject to a number of conditions. For example, students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible for funding.</P>
      <P>The third level institutions take decisions regarding eligibility under the free fees initiative, based on criteria issued by my Department. These institutions do not refer individual queries to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice regarding a particular condition in the criteria is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Where an institution has not extended the benefit of the free fees initiative to an individual student, and the student is of the view that the free fees criteria have not been interpreted correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to the free fees initiative, my Department also funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. On behalf of my Department, the local authorities administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered on behalf of my Department by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. As with the free fees initiative, students who are repeating a year level are generally not eligible for funding for the duration of the repeat period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for a grant must be made to the relevant local authority or VEC. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the terms of the schemes that issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in excep<Col N="571" /> tional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought to date in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been considered by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, students who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

Every effort will be made to ensure that this inspection will take place as soon as possible.

      <P>A final formal offer on payment for supervision and substitution was put to the three teacher unions last month. The INTO has accepted the offer. The Teachers' Union of Ireland put the offer to ballot and it was rejected by a small majority. The Association of Second<Col N="573" /> ary Teachers Ireland Executive Committee voted not to put the offer to a ballot. My Department officials held a meeting with representatives of the three teacher unions on Friday, 2 November 2001 at which the ASTI, supported by the TUI and the INTO, submitted a number of points for consideration and clarification. These related to the core issues of pay, hours, pensionability and to operational arrangements. A further meeting was held with the three teacher unions on 19 November 2001 at which the necessary clarifications were given. It was made clear that there can be no improvement to the core terms of the offer. The ASTI has postponed its threatened ban on supervision and substitution and has indicated that it wishes to have further discussions with my Department. These discussions are being facilitated.</P>

      <P>I signed the first public private partnership contract under the Government's pilot PPP programme on 15 November 2001 with Jarvis PLC for the provision of five new post-primary schools. The new schools, which will cater for around 3,500 pupils, are located in Tubbercurry, 675 pupils, Ballincollig, 1,000, Clones, 500, Dunmanway, 700 and Shannon, 600. The capital value of the schools project is over IR£64 million. The project was developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. In the PPP process, while the maintenance and operation of the buildings is a matter for the successful bidder for the duration of the service contract, in this case 25 years, the management of the schools and their day to day running will remain with the school management authorities. The State will retain legal ownership of all properties. It is intended that the new schools will be available at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>The progress made on these school projects, and on two other projects currently being developed at third level, demonstrate my strong commitment and that of my Department to the PPP process. I intend to harness the potential of PPPs and I am actively identifying other possible education PPP projects.</P>

      <P>As mentioned in my previous reply, the NEPS regional director responsible for the area has already entered into discussions with the school authorities about their need for a psychological service. As a short-term measure, psychologists in the region have agreed to deal with urgent assessment work in the school. In this context, the needs of the child named by the Deputy will be discussed with the school principal and with the relevant clinical agencies to ensure that any necessary action will be taken.</P>

      <P>The provision of psychological support <Col N="575" /> for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties is shared between the psychological services provided by my Department and by the Department of Health and Children. The National Educational Psychological Service Agency provides a psychological service to all post-primary schools and 29 primary schools in County Kildare. NEPS is also initiating a pilot project in a further 26 primary schools. In these schools, initial requests for support for any child with emotional and behavioural difficulties can be made to the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school. The psychologist will provide advice <Col N="576" /> on behavioural management, will undertake any assessment that may be appropriate and may engage in counselling the child and family.</P>
      <P>In acute cases, where more intensive and long-term therapeutic and family support is considered necessary, the NEPS psychologist will refer the child on to the child psychiatric services of the health board. The NEPS psychologist will liaise with the health board services and will continue to be available to offer advice to the school. Pending the full expansion of NEPS to all schools, those schools that do not yet have a service from NEPS should make referrals directly to the Health Board.</P>
